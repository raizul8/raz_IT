******** WORK WITH YOU FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME ***********
If the person is obese/overweight or anything else and wants to WORK WITH YOU FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME(months/Years) take that into consideration.

*******************************
1 Find your niche, figure out SPECIFICALLY what customers you want to attract.

2 Go for it not as a hobby, but as something you really need to do
3 Try to use UpWork(LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook and others), learn how to write to attract your client
Think about how people find you. Think about SEO specific for each platform. Think about who you are writing and who you are trying to attract. Words like plant based, holistic marketing etc speak for the companies, clients you want to attract. When people search for those specific words your profile should pop up first.

Make your profile about the people you are going to interact not about all your qualifications.

4 You should be paid by the value of your work not the time you put into your work
That means not charging per hour,don't charge per time. 
***** Charge for the value of your work, the value you are providing.
Once you have more clients that you can handle you need to outsource some of the business on someone else.
Build a team, hire people to help you with the work so you can act in other areas that are more critical.
Train the people to help you with the work so you can grow your business.

5 Have system to change strangers into clients beyond those social sites above. What to do after you had and audience. 

* blog
Reference blog post as pin on Pinterest, great search engine, maybe you will need business account,pin pictures, content, blog posts, images of lead magnet or freebie, have people redirected to them. 
Run ads on Pinterest

* podcast
* package you knowledge into an online program and post it on platform like Teachable, Thinkific, pasive without having to do 1 on 1 with clients.
* instead of saying the same thing over and over to 1 client you can create a group program, create modules to bring the group through. Facebook group, Practice Better (allows you to schedule and manage group classes), Google might have something like that with Google Groups
* corporate wellness, present to people, employees at a business
* working with wellness brands, try reaching out to them to see what they need
* meal plan subscription
* see what kind of wellness ideas there are maybe you will have a spark of inspiration
* sell e-books, self publish on Amazon
* recommend supplements maybe get some money from this
* Practice Better - client management platform, schedule clients, chat
* maybe create software for nutrition
* Run live challenge with a group giving recommendations and support record that, package it, automate it


Take those lessons and create a lead magnet or a freebie opt-in

A lead magnet is a free asset or special deal offered to customers in exchange for their contact details. It can be a discount code, webinar, white paper, ebook, template, or another resource. To gain access to the lead magnet, a consumer must provide their name, email address, and/or company information


An opt-in freebie is a free, valuable piece of content that you offer your audience in exchange for their name and email. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, yes and no. To create an amazing opt-in freebie, you need to put your thinking cap on and figure out what your audience NEEDS from you.

* Meal prepping, meal delivery service. Rent commercial kitchen make food for client, partner with other nutritionist that has this skill set, or hire someone to help you.

* Online cooking class
 
* Health food product

* Wellness app or whatever app, meal planning, journaling app, daily meditation
App that convinces you to eat healthier with scenario

* Haro - Help a Reporter Out - it's a site
A reporter wants to write about gut health, and you are the expert. You can have that reporter reach out to you and you might collaborate and end up in publications.

How To Do Nutrition Coaching Check-Ins (Step By Step)

Check-Ins
The first thing is manage expectations. 
Your clients need to know exactly what to do to get the most from your coaching.
On an on boarding call or email follow up after they sign up, you explain how thing go. You want to make the CHECK-INS PROCESS CRYSTAL CLEAR.

Whatever we need to do has TO BE PHRASED IN THE CLIENT BEST INTEREST.
They need to know when to check in and how to check in. 


//
How to keep track of clients | client check-ins explained

// Example Bio
If people with obesity can be helped not only to return to normal weight, but back to health, then why would you lose the opportunity to avoid the western diseases that plague us. Not only that when you will eventually get sick with these types of diseases the doctor will say "You must take this pills, maybe do this operation etc". If you ask "But doctor if I do these things will I be cured ?" "No, no, no. For the remainder of your life you must take these pills, after your operation you still have to take these pills, and if the disease is back we must operate you again." For many diseases the doctor will not cure you but sell you to big corporations to make money from your sickness by paying medicine, treatments, operations that do not solve the problem. All of this can be avoided. I do not offer advice on treating medical conditions we will simply discuss on the science of nutrition.

You will be helped to create habits that will serve you for the rest of your life.

Explain what you will do and will not do.
