How to get into contact with obese people and people that try to live healthy.

How to sell services or digital products on Shopify.

1 Find your niche
2 Go for it not as a hobby, but as something you really need to do
3 Try to use UpWork(LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook and others), learn how to write to attract your client
Think about how people find you. Think about SEO specific for each platform. Think about who you are writing and who you are trying to attract. Words like plant based, holistic marketing etc speak for the companies, clients you want to attract. When people search for those specific words your profile should pop up first.

Make your profile about the people you are going to interact not about all your qualifications.

4 You should be paid by the value of your work not the time you put into your work
That means not charging per hour,don't charge per time. 
***** Charge for the value of your work, the value you are providing.
Once you have more clients that you can handle you need to outsource some of the business on someone else.
Build a team, hire people to help you with the work so you can act in other areas that are more critical.
Train the people to help you with the work so you can grow your business.
