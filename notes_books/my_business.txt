// As you grow you create a representation of the world in your memory systems. The hippocampus looks at what you want to happen based on your understanding of the world. Basically the hippocampus is looking inside you and outside you and if what's outside matches with whats inside the amygdala and hypothalamus is inhibited. There is a circuit in the brain stem called the reticular activating system. It's the one responsible for waking you up really fast(when your window breaks in the middle of the night you are awake really fast), it puts your cortex in a high arousal state you are conscious.

As long as your internal representation matches the world the hippocampus(is inhibiting the r.a.s) is telling the reticular activating system to remain calm. But as long as there is a deviation the reticular activating system is no longer inhibited.

Basically you have systems kept in check, when something unexpected happens and the internal representation no longer matches (basically something isn't going well) you brain switches to a different state(the gates are lifted) so that maybe it can tackle the new situation. The idea is when something doesn't work switch to something else so at least you have a chance at overcoming the situation. You will have positive emotions, but mostly negative emotions will surface so that you are uncomfortable, in order to motivate you to change your situation for the better.

Something went wrong, you are not looking at the world right, you are worried, but how worried should you be.
So you either looked at the world wrong, or your plan is wrong. 
Sometimes nothing important happened and you should ignore it, sometimes something major happened and you should be worried. Some people react different that's why there is variability in neuroticism.

We don't like to change the representation because the brain physically changed in order to accommodate our world view. When you operate on the basis of your inner world view you create habits, these habits are connected to the reward center. No longer will you be rewarded but you also need to do construction in your brain. That's why it's hard to change.

When people don't want to change the representation they do one or more of the following:
* You are wrong, there is nothing wrong with what I eat. I learned this from my family, friends, neighbors, doctors etc. Basically I will not change my world view.
* If I add to my diet this little thing or I take from my diet this little thing, then all will be well. I change my world view but just a little, so that the change is insignificant and in the end nothing significant is achieved.

When you do realize the world view is wrong, you will feel uncomfortable. Depending on the situation you may freeze, because if the world view is wrong you may have a hole, and that may lead to very negative results. But that should spur you on to find the relevant information to make it right or you are going to end in a lot of trouble. 

// to achieve success
Negotiate with yourself but do not tyrannize yourself.
Chop down the big goal to little pieces, make a schedule to complete the little goals every day. You may not hit your daily goals 100%, maybe 70%-50%. Adjust then slowly increase how much you can do in a day.
You are not your own servant, you are someone you want to present the opportunity to have a good life.

How you know someone is your friend. You tell them bad news, they don't tell you "You're stupid." or derail the conversation with "With something worse happened to me.". Real friend will listen to you, and when you succeed they will want to celebrate with you. 
You have the right and the responsibility to surround yourself with people who are good for the best part of you.

If you have an opportunity to take an opportunity that would provide you with a new skill do it.
Learn how to program, write, read, public speak, negotiate, introduce yourself to people, social network.

Should you take an opportunity ? Take the opportunity if it will teach you something that you can use for other opportunities. Even if it fails it doesn't matter, it's going to be useful for something else later on.

Wealth constitutes what you have when someone takes all you money away. That's why it is good to learn to be competent in multiple directions.

A career or a job is not the fundamental purpose of life.

However, no one is born with this knowledge—and you have a right to demand to know where diet book authors got the information they’re trying to sell you so you can check the credibility of the source and confirm its veracity.

// Addiction
The reward circuit evolved to drive us forward to natural rewards, sex, food, bonding. Extreme versions of natural rewards have a unique ability to capture us. For ex. high calorie foods or hot novel babes give us extra dopamine.

 Too much dopamine though can override our natural satiation mechanisms.
For example: give rats unlimited access to junk food and almost all of them will binge to obesity.
This is also why 4 out of 5 Americans are overweight and about half of those are obese.
That is addicted to food.

Now, in contrast to natural rewards, drugs such as cocaine or alcohol only hook about 10% of users whether they are rats or humans.
This binge mechanism for food or sex was once an evolutionary advantage.

In essence, it is getting it while the getting is good.
Now, you can think of wolves packing away 20 pound of meat per kill or it's mating season and you're the alpha male.
What if mating season never ends?

All those hits of dopamine can tell your brain to do two things.

First they say, "Man, you've hit the evolutionary jackpot."
Second, they kick in a molecular switch called Delta-FosB.

I know it is a fancy word, but dopamine kicks in Delta-FosB and that starts to accumulate in the brain's reward circuit.
Now, with excess chronic consumption of drugs or natural rewards, this build up a Delta-FosB starts to alter the brain and promotes the cycle of binging and craving.

If the binging continues the Delta-FosB builds up and it can lead to brain changes seen in all addicts.
So the dominos are excess consumption excess dopamine, Delta-FosB, brain changes.

One of the first changes is a numbed pleasure response.
It kicks in, and so everyday pleasures really don't satisfy a porn addict.
At the same time other physical changes in the brain make the brain hyper-reactive to porn.

Everything else in the porn user's life is sort of boring, but porn is super exciting.
Finally his willpower erodes as his frontal cortex changes.

I can't emphasize this enough.
All addictions share these same brain changes and the same molecular switch that kicks them in - Delta-FosB.
Now scientists have used brain scans to measure these changes in drug addicts.

Up-here these scans show a reduced pleasure response in drug addicts.
These and several other changes have also been seen in gambling addicts,food addicts, very recently in video game addicts and now in internet addicts.

I apologize for filling up the slide with brain studies.
Just notice the dates.
But I want you to know that they exist.

So far all brain research points only in one direction.
Constant novelty at the click can cause addiction.

We know this because when scientist examined former Internet addicts they found that these brain changes were reversing themselves.

Unfortunately, none of these studies isolate porn users, but they do include them.
Here's the game changer.

At last we have a group of guys who are no longer using Internet porn.
That's right! Heavy users are voluntarily giving it up by the thousands.
These guys are the missing control group in the great porn experiment.

They're showing experts what changing one single variable can do.
I call it "The Resurrection of Guys" as opposed to "the Demise of Guys."

Now, before I continue probably you wanna know why any porn loving guy in his right mind would give it up.
Two words: erectile dysfunction.

Internet porn is killing young men's sexual performance.
Now, Zimbardo said young guys are flaming out with women,this survey by Italian neurologists confirms what we have witnessed over the last few years.

Sexual enhancement drugs often stop working for these guys, if they ever did, because the problem isn't below the belt where viagra works.

Nor is their problem really psychological.
It's due to physical changes in the brain.
Those addiction related changes.
Their numb brains are sending weaker and weaker signals to their bananas.

As doctor Foresta says, "It starts with lower reactions to porn sites.
Then there is a general drop in libido, and in the end it becomes impossible to get an erection.
There are 3 take-aways from this.
First, Foresta is describing a classic addiction process - gradual desensitization.

Second, Internet porn is qualitatively different from Playboy.
Widespread youthful ED has never been seen before.
And finally ED is often the only symptom that gets these guys' attention.
The question is what less obvious symptoms are they missing?
Most don't figure that out until after they quit.
Here's a guy in his late 20s.

"I've been to psychologists and psychiatrists for the last 8 years...have been diagnosed with depression, severe social anxiety, severe memory impairment and a few others.

Have tried Fexer, Ritalin, Xanax, Paxil dropped out at two different colleges, been fired twice,used pot to calm my social anxiety.

I've been approached by quite a few womenI guess due to my looks and status but they quickly flew away due to my incredible weirdness.

I've been a hardcore porn addict since age 14.
For the last 2 years I've been experimenting and finally realised that porn was an issue.
I stopped it completely 2 months ago.

It has been very difficult but so far incredibly worth it.
I've since quit my remaining medication.
My anxiety is nonexistent.

My memory and focus are sharper than they've ever been.
I feel like a huge "chick magnet" and my ED is gone too.
I seriously think I had a rebirth, a second chance at life."

This is why pockets of guys are peering all over the web - body building sites,
sports sites, pickup artists sites - wherever men congregate.

In essence, they are seeking a neurochemical rebirth.
Here's a group on reddit.com who call themselves "Fapstronauts."
Fapping is slang for solo sex, but what they really mean is giving up porn.

They've added about 2,000 members since I captured this picture a month ago.
This movement to unhook from porn is growing rapidly.

In fact, groups are springing up all across the web and in Europe too.
But there is a bizarre fly in the ointment.
Guys in the early 20s aren't regaining
their erectile health as quickly as older guys.

How can a 50-year-old get his mojo back quicker then a 20-something?

The answer, even though older guys have been using porn a whole lot longer they didn't start on today’'s Internet porn.
Now, we know this is a key variable because the older guys didn'’t start having sexual problems until after they got high-speed Internet.

Now, today'’s young teens start on high-speed Internet when their brains are at their peak of dopamine production and neuroplasticity.

This is also when they are the most vulnerable to addiction, but there is another risk.
By adulthood teens strengthen heavily used circuits and prune back unused ones.

So, by age 22 or so a guy's sexual taste can be like deep ruts in his brain.
This can cause panic if a guy has escalated to extreme porn or porn that no longer matches his sexual orientation.

Fortunately brains are plastic so his taste can revert once he quits porn.
As a guy returns to normal sensitivity his brain looks around for the rewards it evolved to see
such as friendly interaction and of course real mates.

Here's one more example of what we hear everyday,
"I feel like the next Sir Isaac Newton or Leonardo da Vinci.
Since I quit a month ago, I've literally:
started a business, taken up piano, been studying French every day,
been programming, drawing, writing, started managing my finances
and I have more awesome ideas than I know what to do with.
My confidence is sky-high.

I already feel like I can talk to any girl!
I am the same guy who took 2,5 extra years to graduate from college
because of procrastination and depression."
I'll conclude with a wish:
I'd like to see Zimbardo's guys
who are wiping out and their caregivers and the experts
listen to the thousands of men who are teaching us
about arousal addiction by escaping it.
Thanks for listening.

As we each sink deeper into a quicksand of calories, more and more mental energy is required to swim upstream against the constant bombardment of advertising and 24–7 panopticon of arm’s-length tempting treats.258 There’s so much food flooding the market now that much of it ends up in the trash. Food waste has progressively increased by about 50 percent since the 1970s.259 Perhaps better in the landfill, though, than filling up our stomachs. And too many of these cheap, fattening foods prioritize shelf life over human life.

After Brandon Lee (the son of Bruce Lee) was shot and killed on the set of Crow, there was an investigation. The investigation revealed that there was no firearm expert during production, that meant weapons were not handled safely. As a result too many people were responsible for the situation that lead to his death, they couldn't just arrest that many people so they got away with it.

When there are too many people involved in doing something bad they are not punished. Just look at the food industry, too many people are involved it's not practical to put all of them in jail. Plus the food industry makes a lot of money, they will protect themselves, they even pay politicians.

The kid that decided to have gastric bypass surgery, he said he is not addicted to fast food it's just that he can't stop. Wow.

// Fasting and exercise can raise BDNF(brain-derived neurotrophic factor) levels in our brain (which plays a critical role in depression treatment), but this can also be achieved by eating and avoiding certain foods.

BDNF controls the growth of new nerve cells(your brain is the biggest concentration of brain cells).

Western diet(animal products and processed foods inhibit BDNF and increase the risk of depression, the saturated fats seems to be the problem).

Plant foods high and flavonoids rise level of BDNF. If you can have high flavonoid intake BDNF levels will rise.

// Good always wins, or so movies and stories we like tell us. But in reality the superheroes are in the fast food restaurant were your kid is begging you to buy a certain meal so he can get a superhero toy. After all heroes are cool, brave and just and so is the brand of fast food that targets your kid even though it's illegal. And your kid associates fast food with super heroes. 

	There are also games that have the brand and products in the environment of the game. The kid plays and 
the environment of the game promotes the brand of fast food, it's a loophole in legislation, even though you can't advertise to children, psychology is used to influence the kids. By having the environment with the logos and products of the business the kid is influenced by associating it with something fun, and it's legal.

The surgery that reduces stomach size(gastric bypass), not only has a lot of nasty side effects but it is also unnecessary. This is extreme, with serious consequences to your health. I saw a doctor that was doing this kind of operation. He did not start by mentioning the horrible things that could happen to the patient. He mentioned how the patient will lose weight after the operation and how he will be a normal boy, how he will have to do exercise and change his diet. But if you have to change your diet and do exercise, why not just do that. Well then you no longer have to pay him for the operation.

When put under pressure do things fast, we make more mistakes. For example if someone asks us a question and then yells continuously, impatient for an answer, we have a very hard time thinking logically or remembering things. By asking a question the neocortex is involved but by putting us under pressure the animal brain is activated and it undermines our thinking process because it's much stronger.

After you fully switched and ate this food for a month go check your blood pressure and do another test to see your cholesterol.

The GAO estimated that doctors make nearly a million more referrals every year than they would have if they were not personally profiting.

My only whole-citrus caveat: Inform your physician if you eat grapefruit. This fruit can suppress the enzymes that help clear more than half of commonly prescribed drugs, and less drug clearance means higher drug levels in the body.36 This may actually be good if you want a better caffeine buzz from your morning coffee37 or if your doctor wants to help you save money by boosting the effects of expensive drugs instead of just peeing them away.38 But higher drug levels may also mean higher risk of side effects, so if you regularly eat grapefruits, your physician may want to change your prescription or alter the dosing.

What Does “Whole-Food, Plant-Based” Mean, Exactly?

Sometimes people’s diets take on a religiosity of their own. I remember a man once telling me that he could never “go plant based” because he could never give up his grandma’s chicken soup. Huh? Then don’t! After I asked him to say hello to his bubby for me, I told him that enjoying her soup shouldn’t keep him from making healthier choices the rest of the time. The problem with all-or-nothing thinking is that it keeps people from even taking the first steps. The thought of never having pepperoni pizza again somehow turns into an excuse to keep ordering it every week. Why not scale down to once a month or reserve it for special occasions? We cannot let the “perfect” be the enemy of the good.

It’s really the day-to-day stuff that matters most. What you eat on special occasions is insignificant compared to what you eat day in and day out. So don’t beat yourself up if you really want to put edible bacon-flavored candles on your birthday cake. (I’m not making those up!40) Your body has a remarkable ability to recover from sporadic insults as long as you’re not habitually poking it with a fork.

*   *   *

This book is not about vegetarianism, veganism, or any other “-ism.” There are people who completely eliminate any and all animal products as part of a religious or moral stance and may indeed end up better off as a side benefit.41 But strictly from a human health standpoint, you would be hard pressed to argue, for example, that the traditional Okinawan diet, which is 96 percent plant based,42 is inferior to a typical Western, 100 percent vegan diet. In Kaiser Permanente’s guide “The Plant-Based Diet: A Healthier Way to Eat,” the authors define a plant-based diet as one that excludes animal products completely, but they make sure to note: “If you find you cannot do a plant-based diet 100 percent of the time, then aim for 80 percent. Any movement toward more plants and fewer animal products can improve your health!”43

From a nutrition standpoint, the reason I don’t like the terms vegetarian and vegan is that they are only defined by what you don’t eat. When I used to speak on college campuses, I would meet vegans who appeared to be living off french fries and beer. Vegan, technically, but not exactly health promoting. That’s why I prefer the term whole-food, plant-based nutrition. As far as I can discern, the best available balance of evidence suggests that the healthiest diet is one centered on unprocessed plant foods. On a day-to-day basis, the more whole plant foods and the fewer processed and animal products, the better.

//******************************** No antioxidant supplements ***********************8
Is there anything you can do to mediate the radiation risk? As with so many other health questions, the answer is that you can eat healthfully.

In an investigation funded by the National Cancer Institute, researchers studied the diets and chromosome integrity of airline pilots, who get zapped with radiation daily, to see which foods might be protective. They found that pilots who consumed the most dietary antioxidants suffered the least amount of DNA damage to their bodies. Note the word dietary. Antioxidant supplements, such as vitamins C and E, didn’t seem to help. Pilots who consumed the most vitamin C through fruits and vegetables, though, appeared to be protected.32 Taking antioxidant supplements may be more than just a waste of money. People given 500 mg of vitamin C a day were found to end up with more oxidative DNA damage.33

Remember that natural antioxidants in food work synergistically; it’s the combination of many different compounds working together that tends to protect you, not high doses of single antioxidants found in supplements. Indeed, those pilots eating a mix of phytonutrients, concentrated in a variety of such plant foods as citrus, nuts, seeds, pumpkins, and peppers, had the lowest levels of DNA damage in response to the radiation they were bombarded with every day from the galaxy.34

The research team found that green, leafy vegetables like spinach and kale appear to have an edge over other vegetables and fruits when it comes to radiation protection.35 All this time I’ve been packing kale chips on flights just because they’re so lightweight, but it also turns out they may be protecting my DNA.

The same plant-based protection enjoyed by pilots was also found among atomic bomb survivors. For several decades, researchers have followed thirty-six thousand survivors of the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Those who ate vegetable- or fruit-rich diets appeared to cut their cancer risk by about 36 percent.36 We saw the same thing in the aftermath of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine, where consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables apparently protected children’s immune systems, while egg and fish consumption was associated with a significantly increased risk of DNA damage. The researchers suggest this result could have been due to the possibility that the animal foods they ate were contaminated with radioactive elements or the role of animal fats in free-radical formation.


//******
I do not recommend that people ignore their doctors’ advice. Whatever you and your medical team decide together, healthy diet and lifestyle changes can presumably only help. That’s the nice thing about lifestyle interventions—they can be implemented in addition to whatever other treatment options are chosen. In a research setting, that can complicate matters, as you don’t know which action may be responsible for any improvement. But when facing a cancer diagnosis, you may want to opt for all the help you can get. Regardless of whether cancer patients elect for chemo, surgery, or radiation, they can always improve their diets. A prostate-healthy diet is a breast-healthy diet is a heart-healthy diet is a body-healthy diet.

//
As with so much in medicine, clinical practice often flies blind without solid experimental support. This changed with a landmark study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which pitted the traditional, low-calcium diet against a diet low in animal protein and sodium. After five years, the study found that eating less meat and salt was about twice as effective as the conventionally prescribed low-calcium diet, cutting kidney-stone risk by half.

**********************
A blood pressure checkup is easy to ignore or postpone. Unlike the case with many of our other leading killers, the insidious consequences of hypertension may not be apparent until you’re lifted into an ambulance or lowered into a grave. So go to your local pharmacy, fire station, or doctor’s office and get your blood pressure checked. If it’s too high, the bad news is that you’ll join the one billion people living with this condition. The good news is that you don’t have to join the millions who die from it every year. Try eating and living healthfully for even just a few weeks, and you may be amazed by the results. Here are just a few stories about people who did just that.


//*******************************************
If people are unwilling to reduce their meat consumption, they should be encouraged to eat more fruits and vegetables to balance out that acid load.44 “However,” one kidney doctor editorialized, “many patients find it difficult to follow a diet high in fruits and vegetables and might therefore be more adherent to a supplement.”45

So what did researchers try? Giving people baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) pills. Instead of treating the primary cause of the excess acid formation (too many animal products and too few fruits and vegetables), they preferred to treat the consequences. Too much acid? Here’s some base to neutralize it. Sodium bicarbonate can effectively buffer the acid load,46 but, rather obviously, sodium bicarbonate contains sodium, which over the long term may itself contribute to kidney damage.47

Unfortunately, this type of Band-Aid approach is all too typical of today’s medical model. Cholesterol too high from eating a diet unnaturally high in saturated fat and cholesterol? Take a statin drug to cripple your cholesterol-making enzyme. Diet unnaturally high in acid-forming foods? Swallow some baking soda pills to balance that right out.

These same researchers also tried giving people fruits and vegetables instead of baking soda and found that they offered similar protections, with the additional advantage of lowering the subjects’ blood pressure. The title of the accompanying commentary in the medical journal was telling: “The Key to Halting Progression of CKD Might Be in the Produce Market, Not in the Pharmacy.”


//****************** I give you the knowledge, it is up to you what you do with it. You may not use it for you, but what about your child or children. But if you don't adopt the diet(practice what you preach) your children will grow resentful(because you are a hypocrit even thought they don't know the word, they they are sensitive to this kind of behaviour, how can you expect them to follow your rules, if you don't follow your own rules).************************************************

The reason that the DASH diet was modeled explicitly after vegetarian diets but was not meat-free itself might surprise you. The primary design goal of the DASH diet was to explicitly create eating patterns “that would have the blood pressure lowering benefits of a vegetarian diet yet contain enough animal products to make them palatable to nonvegetarians.…”107 Dr. Sacks had even shown that the more dairy vegetarians consumed, the higher their blood pressure appeared to rise.108 But he figured there was no point in calling for a diet he believed few would follow. This is a recurring theme in official dietary recommendations. Instead of simply telling you what the science shows and then letting you make up your own mind, experts patronize the population by advocating what they think is practical rather than ideal. By making the decision for you, they undermine those willing to make even greater changes for optimal health.

The DASH diet does help to bring down blood pressure, but the primary effect seems to arise not from the switch to low-fat dairy and white meat or the reduction in sweets and added fats but from the added fruits and vegetables.109 If the benefits are due to the added plant foods, why not strive to center people’s diets more around these healthiest of foods in the first place?

//*********************************************************************
Losing Weight with a Plant-Based Diet

As noted earlier, even if you don’t eat extra fat, the extra fat you wear may cause the spillover effect—the tendency for overstretched fat cells to spill fat into the bloodstream. The advantage of a whole-food, plant-based approach to weight loss is that there may be no need for portion control, skipping meals, or counting calories, because most plant foods are naturally nutrient dense and low in calories.

*********************Amount of food in a 100 calorie serving***********************

Steamed Broccoli 285 gr 		Tomatoes 555 gr 		Strawberries 310 gr


Grilled chicken breast 70 gr 	Cheddar Cheese 25 gr 	Baked white fish 105 gr

Fruits and vegetables, on average, contain about 80–90 percent water. Just as fiber can bulk up the volume of foods without adding calories, so can water. Experiments have shown that people tend to eat the same amount of food at a meal, regardless of calorie count—probably because stretch receptors in the stomach send signals to the brain after a certain volume of food has been ingested. When much of that volume is a zero-calorie component like fiber or water, that means you can eat more food but gain less weight.57

Figure 2 shows the amounts of broccoli, tomatoes, and strawberries that contain one hundred calories, compared with the quantities of one hundred calories of chicken, cheese, and fish. You’ll notice that even though the calorie content is the same, the volume of these foods is different. So it makes sense that one hundred calories of the plants would be more likely to fill you up, while the same one hundred calories from animal or processed foods may leave you half-empty.

That’s why whole-food, plant-based diets are great for people who like to eat, since you can basically eat as much as you want without worrying about counting calories.

// Profit at your expense
So instead of giving these animals a little more breathing room, the pork industry just largely passes along to society the estimated $250 million cost of sickening tens of thousands of Americans every year

When you get in trouble the industry won't pay for your medical bills(if you survive, that is). Same for all the people that tell you what good nutrition is, when you get in trouble "Dude that's your problem". Except maybe for your family, although unlikely(Steve Jobs story, when doctors recommended fish and had his family convince him).

// Hedonism the pursuit of pleasure consumes a lot of energy. After, you feel drained. There is no achievement at the end of hedonism, no reward or the reward is too little. It can be used as motivation to finish your tasks but be very careful of overindulgence. Hedonism is guided by your animal brain. You are meant to chase to achieve what your genes want you to do, not waste time on enjoyment or satisfaction(that's why they don't last long or worse you won't feel any enjoyment or satisfaction just a whole lot of unbalance ), YOU HAVE A MISSION TO DO, TO SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH TO REPRODUCE AS MANY TIMES AS POSSIBLE.

Self improvement is like taking care of a garden. It may not give you a lot of dopamine during or before your tasks but you will feel much better after. Because you have gained something.

// You should train 6 days a week. Don't chase intensity, but don't do to little. Just enough to be set up for tomorrow, to be energized for tomorrow. If it's to easy increase intensity if its to intense you can't recover, reduce intensity. You want a state of flow, between intensity and too easy, you want playful training and you want consistency. Not 3 days a week high intensity, you want 6 days, one training session at least. Try to make your training playful, like how some wrestlers do, and achieve consistency.

You want intensity, the next days you will be sore. Sure you should do it from time to time to see you limits, but the next days you are not good anymore.

//
Most doctors won't advise their patient to stop smoking, because that's what the patient wants to do. So if you go to the doctor even if he were to be trained in nutrition(which he is not), you would not be advised to eat properly. The doctor will prescribe pills and treatments to work around your bad nutrition.

//
Sitting is not good because of endothelial dysfunction(when you sit too much, your blood flow slows too much, the blood sludges, the pooling of your blood). Sitting for like 6 hours causes arteries in your legs to dysfunction, because they are bent. You can take breaks, do little exercise, and also turmeric.

//
Certainly there are prescription medications that can help with some of these conditions. For example, you can take statin drugs for your cholesterol to lower risk of heart attacks, pop different pills and inject insulin for diabetes, and take a slew of diuretics and other blood pressure medications for hypertension. But there is only one unifying diet that may help prevent, arrest, or even reverse each of these killers. Unlike with medications, there isn’t one kind of diet for optimal liver function and a different diet to improve our kidneys. A heart-healthy diet is a brain-healthy diet is a lung-healthy diet. The same diet that helps prevent cancer just so happens to be the same diet that may help prevent type 2 diabetes and every other cause of death on the top-fifteen list. 

Unlike drugs—which only target specific functions, can have dangerous side effects, and may only treat the symptoms of disease—a healthy diet can benefit all organ systems at once, has good side effects, and may treat the underlying cause of illness.

// Talk about That study where Americans that ate normally (that ate meat, dairy, and plant food(I actually can't remember how much processed food they ate)) where better than vegetarians and vegetarians were better that vegans. I was shocked, vegans were the worst when they were supposed to be the best. So scientist tried to find out why. It was simple, people were not informed about what a healthy diet was supposed to be and they replaced meat and dairy with processed foods.
******* I ALSO DON'T RECOMMEND VEGETARIAN OR VEGAN DIET *********************

That one unifying diet found to best prevent and treat many of these chronic diseases is a whole-food, plant-based diet, defined as an eating pattern that encourages the consumption of unrefined plant foods and discourages meats, dairy products, eggs, and processed foods.92 In this book, I don’t advocate for a vegetarian diet or a vegan diet. I advocate for an evidence-based diet, and the best available balance of science suggests that the more whole plant foods we eat, the better—both to reap their nutritional benefits and to displace less healthful options.

Halting Cognitive Decline with Exercise?

There is exciting news for people on the verge of losing their mental faculties. In a 2010 study published in the Archives of Neurology, researchers took a group of people with mild cognitive impairment—those who are starting to forget things, for example, or regularly repeating themselves—and had them engage in aerobic exercise for forty-five to sixty minutes a day, four days a week, for six months. The control group was instructed to simply stretch for the same time periods.154

Memory tests were performed before and after the study. Researchers found that in the control (stretching) group, cognitive function continued to decline. But the exercising group not only didn’t get worse, they got better. The exercisers got more test answers correct after six months, indicating their memory had improved.155

Subsequent studies using MRI scans found that aerobic exercise can actually reverse age-related shrinkage in the memory centers of the brain.156 No such effect was found in the stretching and toning control groups or a nonaerobic strength-training group.157 Aerobic exercise can help improve cerebral blood flow, improve memory performance, and help preserve brain tissue.

Carcinogen-Blocking Effects of Turmeric

The Indian spice turmeric, which gives curry powder its characteristic golden color, may also help prevent some of the DNA damage caused by smoking. Since 1987, the National Cancer Institute has tested more than a thousand different compounds for “chemopreventive” (cancer-preventing) activity. Only a few dozen have made it to clinical trials, but among the most promising is curcumin, the bright-yellow pigment in turmeric.12

Chemopreventive agents can be classified into different subgroups based on which stage of cancer development they help to fight: Carcinogen blockers and antioxidants help prevent the initial triggering DNA mutation, and antiproliferatives work by keeping tumors from growing and spreading. Curcumin is special in that it appears to belong to all three groups, meaning it may potentially help prevent and/or arrest cancer cell growth.13

*************************************************************************8
The anticancer effects of curcumin extend beyond its ability to potentially prevent DNA mutations. It also appears to help regulate programmed cell death. Your cells are preprogrammed to die naturally to make way for fresh cells through a process known as apoptosis (from the Greek ptosis, falling, and apo, away from). In a sense, your body is rebuilding itself every few months with the building materials you provide it through your diet. Some cells, however, overstay their welcome—namely, cancer cells. By somehow disabling their own suicide mechanism, they don’t die when they’re supposed to. Because they continue to thrive and divide, cancer cells can eventually form tumors and potentially spread throughout the body.

So how does curcumin affect this process? It appears to have the ability to reprogram the self-destruct mechanism back into cancer cells. All cells contain so-called death receptors that trigger the self-destruction sequence, but cancer cells can disable their own death receptors. Curcumin, however, appears able to reactivate them.17 Curcumin can also kill cancer cells directly by activating “execution enzymes” called caspases inside cancer cells that destroy them from within by chopping up their proteins.18 Unlike most chemotherapy drugs, against which cancer cells can develop resistance over time, curcumin affects several mechanisms of cell death simultaneously, making it potentially harder for cancer cells to avoid destruction.19

Curcumin has been found to be effective against a variety of other cancer cells in vitro, including those of the breast, brain, blood, colon, kidney, liver, lungs, and skin. For reasons not fully understood, curcumin seems to leave noncancerous cells alone.20 Unfortunately, turmeric has yet to be tested in clinical trials for the prevention or treatment of lung cancer, but with no downsides at culinary doses, I’d suggest trying to find ways to incorporate the spice into your diet. I offer a number of suggestions in part 2

//************************************ From a risk-benefit standpoint, there is no risk ****************
Within just one year of eating healthier, all but two patients were able to drop their dose of asthma medication or get off their steroids and other drugs altogether. Objective measures like lung function and physical working capacity improved; meanwhile, subjectively, some patients said their improvement was so considerable that they felt like “they had a new life.”62

There was no control group, so the placebo effect may have accounted for some of the improvement, but the nice thing about a healthier diet is that there are only good side effects. In addition to improvements in their asthma control, the study subjects lost an average of eighteen pounds, and their cholesterol and blood pressures got better. From a risk-benefit standpoint, then, it’s definitely worth giving a plant-based diet a try.

//******************************
In my clinical practice, whenever I’ve felt under too much time pressure to address a patient’s smoking or bad dietary habits, I stop and think back to the hideous death of that man in Boston. No one deserves to die like that. I’d like to think no one has to.


//*******************************
The primary reason diseases tend to run in families may be that diets tend to run in families.

For most of our leading killers, nongenetic factors like diet can account for at least 80 or 90 percent of cases. As I noted before, this is based on the fact that the rates of cardiovascular disease and major cancers differ fivefold to a hundredfold around the world. Migration studies show this is not just genetics. When people move from low- to high-risk areas, their disease risk nearly always shoots up to match the new setting.101 As well, dramatic changes in disease rates within a single generation highlight the primacy of external factors. Colon cancer mortality in Japan in the 1950s was less than one-fifth that of the United States (including Americans of Japanese ancestry).102 But now colon cancer rates in Japan are as bad as they are in the United States, a rise that has been attributed in part to the fivefold increase in meat consumption.

// Twins you can have twins with very different health based on diet
Research has shown us that identical twins separated at birth will get different diseases based on how they live their lives. A recent American Heart Association–funded study compared the lifestyles and arteries of nearly five hundred twins. It found that diet and lifestyle factors clearly trumped genes.104 You share 50 percent of your genes with each of your parents, so if one parent dies of a heart attack, you know you’ve inherited some of that susceptibility. But even among identical twins who have the exact same genes, one could die early of a heart attack and the other could live a long, healthy life with clean arteries depending on what she ate and how she lived. Even if both your parents died with heart disease, you should be able to eat your way to a healthy heart. Your family history does not have to become your personal destiny.

Cancer cells can use epigenetics against us by silencing tumor-suppressor genes that could otherwise stop the cancer in its tracks. So even if you’re born with good genes, cancer can sometimes find a way to turn them off. A number of chemotherapy drugs have been developed to restore our bodies’ natural defenses, but their use has been limited due to their high toxicity.107 There are, however, a number of compounds distributed widely throughout the plant kingdom—including beans, greens, and berries—that appear to have the same effect naturally.108 For example, dripping green tea on colon, esophageal, or prostate cancer cells has been shown to reactivate genes silenced by the cancer.109 This hasn’t just been demonstrated in a petri dish, though. Three hours after eating a cup of broccoli sprouts, the enzyme that cancers use to help silence our defenses is suppressed in your bloodstream110 to an extent equal to or greater than the chemotherapy agent specifically designed for that purpose,111 without the toxic side effects.

//***************************** I don't recommend omega-3 from fish oil **********************
Is Fish Oil Just Snake Oil?

Thanks in part to the American Heart Association’s recommendation that individuals at high risk for heart disease should ask their physicians about omega-3 fish oil supplementation,10 fish oil pills have grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. We now consume more than one hundred thousand tons of fish oil every year.11

But what does the science say? Are the purported benefits of fish oil supplementation for the prevention and treatment of heart disease just a fish tale? A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at all the best randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of omega-3 fats on life span, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke. These included studies not only on fish oil supplements but also studies on the effects of advising people to eat more oily fish. What did they find? Overall, the researchers found no protective benefit for overall mortality, heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death, heart attack, or stroke.12

What about for someone who had already had a heart attack and is trying to prevent another? Still no benefit was found.13

Where did we even get this idea that the omega-3 fats in fish and fish oil supplements are good for you? There was a notion that Eskimos were protected from heart disease, but that appears to be a complete myth.14 Some early studies, however, looked promising. For example, the famous DART trial from the 1980s involving two thousand men found that those advised to eat fatty fish had a 29 percent reduction in mortality.15 That’s impressive, so it’s no wonder the study got a lot of attention. But people seem to have forgotten about the sequel, the DART-2 trial, which found the exact opposite. Run by the same group of researchers, the DART-2 trial was an even bigger study—three thousand men—but this time, participants advised to eat oily fish and particularly those who were supplied with fish oil capsules had a higher risk of cardiac death.16,17

After putting all the studies together, researchers concluded that there was no longer justification for the use of omega-3s in everyday clinical practice.18 What should doctors do when their patients follow the American Heart Association’s advice and inquire about fish oil supplements? As the director of Lipids and Metabolism at Mount Sinai’s cardiovascular institute put it: “Given this and other negative meta-analyses, our job [as doctors] should be to stop highly marketed fish oil supplementation to all our patients…”

//*****************************************
The optimal LDL cholesterol level is probably 50 or 70 mg/dL, and apparently, the lower, the better. That’s where you start out at birth, that’s the level seen in populations largely free of heart disease, and that’s the level at which the progression of atherosclerosis appears to stop in cholesterol-lowering trials.28 An LDL around 70 mg/dL corresponds to a total cholesterol reading of about 150, the level below which no deaths from coronary heart disease were reported in the famous Framingham Heart Study, a generations-long project to identify risk factors for heart disease.29 The population target should therefore be a total cholesterol level under 150 mg/dL. “If such a goal was created,” Dr. Roberts wrote, “the great scourge of the Western world would be essentially eliminated.”30

The average cholesterol for people living in the United States is much higher than 150 mg/dL; it hovers around 200 mg/dL. If your blood test results came back with a total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, your physician might reassure you that your cholesterol is normal. But in a society where it’s normal to die of heart disease, having a “normal” cholesterol level is probably not a good thing.

To become virtually heart-attack proof, you need to get your LDL cholesterol at least under 70 mg/dL. Dr. Roberts noted that there are only two ways to achieve this for our population: to put more than a hundred million Americans on a lifetime of medications or to recommend they all eat a diet centered around whole plant foods.31

So: drugs or diet. All health plans cover cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, so why change your diet if you can simply pop a pill every day for the rest of your life? Unfortunately, as we’ll see in chapter 15, these drugs don’t work nearly as well as people think, and they may cause undesirable side effects to boot.


//************************************************
Endotoxins Crippling Your Arteries

Unhealthy diets don’t just affect the structure of your arteries; an unhealthy diet can also affect their functioning. Your arteries are not merely inert pipes through which blood flows. They are dynamic, living organs. We’ve known for nearly two decades that a single fast-food meal—Sausage and Egg McMuffins were used in the original study—can stiffen your arteries within hours, cutting in half their ability to relax normally.43 And just as this inflammatory state starts to calm down five or six hours later—lunchtime! You may once again whack your arteries with another load of harmful food, leaving many Americans stuck in a danger zone of chronic, low-grade inflammation. Unhealthy meals don’t just cause internal damage decades down the road but right here and now, within hours of going into your mouth.

Originally, researchers blamed the animal fat or animal protein, but attention has recently shifted to bacterial toxins known as “endotoxins.” Certain foods, such as meats, appear to harbor bacteria that can trigger inflammation dead or alive, even when the food is fully cooked. Endotoxins are not destroyed by cooking temperatures, stomach acid, or digestive enzymes, so after a meal of animal products, these endotoxins may end up in your intestines. They are then thought to be ferried by saturated fat across the gut wall into your bloodstream, where they can trigger the inflammatory reaction in your arteries.44

This may help explain the remarkable speed at which cardiac patients can experience relief when placed on a diet composed primarily of plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Dr. Ornish reported a 91 percent reduction in angina attacks within just a few weeks in patients placed on a plant-based diet both with45 or without46 exercise. This rapid resolution in chest pain occurred well before their bodies could have cleared the plaque from their arteries, suggesting plant-based diets don’t just help clean out arteries but also improve their day-to-day function. In contrast, control-group patients who were instead told to follow the advice of their doctors had a 186 percent increase in angina attacks.47 It’s no surprise their conditions worsened, given that they continued to eat the same diet that crippled their arteries in the first place.

We’ve known about the dramatic power of dietary changes for decades. For example, there was a paper entitled “Angina and Vegan Diet” published in the American Heart Journal back in 1977. Vegan diets are exclusively plant based, avoiding meat, dairy, and eggs. Doctors described cases like that of Mr. F. W. (initials are often used to protect patient confidentiality), a sixty-five-year-old man with angina so severe he had to stop every nine or ten steps. He couldn’t even make it to the mailbox. He was started on a vegan diet, and his pain improved within days. Within months, he was reportedly climbing mountains with no pain at all.48

Not ready to start eating healthier? Well, there is a new class of antiangina drugs, such as ranolazine (sold as Ranexa). A drug company executive suggested its product be used for people not “able to comply with the substantial dietary changes required to achieve a vegan diet.”49 The medication costs more than $2,000 a year, but the side effects are relatively minor, and it does work … technically speaking. At the highest dose, Ranexa was able to prolong exercise duration by 33.5 seconds.50 More than half a minute! It doesn’t look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon.


//****************************** brain diseases
In my clinical practice, whenever I’ve felt under too much time pressure to address a patient’s smoking or bad dietary habits, I stop and think back to the hideous death of that man in Boston. No one deserves to die like that. I’d like to think no one has to.

//************************
Later in life, my grandma started to lose her mind. By then, I was in medical school, but my newfound knowledge was useless. She had turned. My previously sweet and stately grandmother? Now she threw things at people. She cursed. Her caretaker showed me the teeth marks on her arm where my once kind, loving grandma had bitten her.

That’s the horror of brain disease. Unlike a problem with your foot or your back or even another vital organ, brain disease can attack your self.

The two most serious brain diseases are stroke, which kills nearly 130,000 Americans each year,1 and Alzheimer’s disease, which kills nearly 85,000.2 Most strokes can be thought of as “brain attacks”—like heart attacks, but the rupturing plaques in your arteries cut off blood flow to parts of the brain rather than to parts of the heart. Alzheimer’s is more like a mind attack.

Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most physically and emotionally burdensome diseases, for both sufferers and caregivers. Unlike stroke, which can kill instantly and without any warning, Alzheimer’s involves a slower, more subtle decline over months or years. Instead of cholesterol-filled plaques in your arteries, plaques made of a substance called amyloid develop in the brain tissue itself, associated with the loss of memory and, eventually, loss of life.

While the pathology of stroke and Alzheimer’s are different, one key factor unites them: Mounting evidence suggests that a healthy diet may help prevent them both.

//
STROKE

In about 90 percent of strokes,3 blood flow to part of the brain gets cut off, depriving it of oxygen and killing off the part fed by the clogged artery. That’s called an ischemic stroke (from the Latin ischaemia, meaning “stopping blood”). A small minority of strokes are hemorrhagic strokes, which are caused by bleeding into the brain when a blood vessel bursts. The damage wrought by a stroke depends on which area of the brain was deprived of oxygen (or where bleeding occurred) and for how long the deprivation lasted. People who experience a brief stroke might only need to contend with arm or leg weakness, while those who suffer a major stroke can develop paralysis, lose the ability to speak, or, as is too often the case, die.

Sometimes the blood clot lasts only a moment—not long enough to notice but still long enough to kill off a tiny portion of your brain. These so-called silent strokes can multiply and slowly reduce cognitive function until full-blown dementia develops.4 The goal is to reduce the risk of both the massive strokes that can kill you instantly and the ministrokes that kill you over the course of years. Just as with heart disease, a healthy diet can reduce stroke risk by reducing cholesterol and blood pressure while improving blood flow and antioxidant capacity.

//*****************************************
Granted, you’d have to eat an extraordinarily healthy diet to attain this level of fiber intake, far beyond what is arbitrarily determined as adequate by most health authorities. Rather than patronizing you with what they think is “achievable” by the masses, though, I wish these authorities would just tell you what the science says and let you make up your own mind.


// Antioxidant and free radicals
Antioxidant-rich diets appear to protect against stroke by preventing the circulation of oxidized fats in the bloodstream that can damage the sensitive walls of small blood vessels in the brain.52 They can also help decrease artery stiffness,53 prevent blood clots from forming,54 and lower blood pressure55 and inflammation. 

******************************************************************************************
Free radicals can disfigure proteins in our bodies to the extent they become unrecognizable by our immune systems. The inflammatory response this triggers can be prevented by saturating our bodies with sufficient antioxidants. Whereas all whole plant foods may have anti-inflammatory effects,57 some plants are better than others. High-antioxidant fruits and vegetables, such as berries and greens, have been found to douse systemic inflammation significantly better than the same number of servings of more common low-antioxidant fruits and veggies, such as bananas and lettuce.


// Amyloid plaques
Amyloid plaques are aggregates of misfolded proteins that form in the spaces between nerve cells. These abnormally configured proteins are thought to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid plaques first develop in the areas of the brain concerned with memory and other cognitive functions.


//***********************************************************************
Phytates

Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States,29 yet in some parts of the world, it’s practically unheard of. The highest rates have been recorded in Connecticut, and the lowest in Kampala, Uganda.30 Why is colorectal cancer so much more prevalent in Western cultures? Seeking answers to this question, renowned surgeon Denis Burkitt spent twenty-four years in Uganda. Many of the Ugandan hospitals Dr. Burkitt visited had never even seen a case of colon cancer.31 He eventually came to the conclusion that fiber intake was the key,32 as most Ugandans consumed diets centered around whole plant foods.33

Subsequent research has suggested that dietary prevention of cancer may involve something other than just fiber. For instance, colorectal cancer rates are higher in Denmark than in Finland,34 yet Danes consume slightly more dietary fiber than Finns.35 What other protective compounds might explain the low cancer rates among plant-based populations? Well, fiber isn’t the only thing found in whole plant foods that’s missing from processed and animal-based foods.

The answer might lie in natural compounds called phytates, which are found in the seeds of plants—in other words, in all whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. Phytates have been shown to detoxify excess iron in the body, which otherwise can generate a particularly harmful kind of free radical called hydroxyl radicals.36 The standard American diet may therefore be a double whammy when it comes to colorectal cancer: Meat contains the type of iron (heme) particularly associated with colorectal cancer37 but lacks, as do refined plant foods, the phytates to extinguish these iron-forged free radicals.

For many years, phytates were maligned as inhibitors of mineral absorption, which is why you might have heard advice to roast, sprout, or soak your nuts to get rid of the phytates. In theory, this would allow you to absorb more minerals, such as calcium. This belief stemmed from a series of laboratory experiments on puppies from 1949 that suggested that phytates had a bone-softening, anticalcifying effect,38 as well as from subsequent studies with similar findings on rats.39 But more recently, in light of actual human data, phytates’ image has undergone a complete makeover.40 Those who eat more high-phytate foods actually tend to have a greater bone mineral density,41 less bone loss, and fewer hip fractures.42 Phytates appear to protect bone in a manner similar to that of antiosteoporosis drugs like Fosamax,43 but without the risk of osteonecrosis (bone rot) of the jaw, a rare, potentially disfiguring side effect associated with that class of drugs.44

Phytates may also help protect against colorectal cancer. A six-year study of about thirty thousand Californians found that higher meat consumption was associated with higher risk of colon cancer. Unexpectedly, white meat appeared to be worse. Indeed, those who ate red meat at least once each week had about double the risk of developing colon cancer; that risk appeared to triple, however, for those who ate chicken or fish once or more a week.45 Eating beans, an excellent source of phytates, was found to help mediate some of that risk, so your colon cancer risk may be determined by your meat-to-vegetable ratio.

There may be as much as an eightfold difference in colorectal cancer risk between the two extremes—high-vegetable, low-meat diets and low-vegetable, high-meat diets.46 So it may not be enough to just cut down on how much meat is in your diet; you also need to eat more plants. The National Cancer Institute’s Polyp Prevention Trial found that those who increased their bean consumption by even less than one-quarter cup a day appeared to cut their odds of precancerous colorectal polyp recurrence by up to 65 percent.47

Of all the wonderful nutrients in beans, why do we credit the phytates with reduced risk? Petri-dish studies have shown that phytates inhibit the growth of virtually all human cancer cells tested so far—including cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, liver, pancreas, and skin48—while leaving normal cells alone.49 This is the mark of a good anticancer agent, the ability to discriminate between tumor cells and normal tissue. When you eat whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, phytates are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and readily taken up by tumor cells. Tumors concentrate these compounds so efficiently that phytate scans can be used to trace the spread of cancer within the body.50

Phytates target cancer cells through a combination of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-enhancing activities. Besides affecting the cancer cells directly, phytates have been found to boost the activity of natural killer cells, which are white blood cells that form your first line of defense by hunting down and disposing of cancer cells.51 Phytates can also play a role in your last line of defense, which involves starving tumors of their blood supply. There are many phytonutrients in plant foods that can help block the formation of new blood vessels that feed tumors, but phytates also appear able to disrupt existing tumor supply lines.52 Similarly, many plant compounds appear able to help slow down and even stop cancer cell growth,53 but phytates can sometimes also cause cancer cells to apparently revert back to their normal state—in other words, to stop behaving like cancer. This cancer cell “rehabilitation” has been demonstrated in vitro in colon cancer cells,54 as well as in cancer cells of the breast,55 liver,56 and prostate.57

Phytates do have side effects, but they all appear to be good. High phytate intake has been associated with less heart disease, less diabetes, and fewer kidney stones. In fact, some researchers have suggested that phytates be considered an essential nutrient. Like vitamins, phytates participate in important biochemical reactions in the body. Your levels fluctuate with dietary intake, and insufficient consumption is associated with diseases that can be moderated by eating adequate amounts. Maybe phytates should be considered “Vitamin P.

You can’t prepare for unknown factors, but if you have a better pre-game focus, you will likely only have to deal with one or two rather than ten. In New York, too many bubbled up, and unknown factors usually blaze a wake of doubt. Afterward, I was eye to eye with my haters and acknowledged that my margin for error was small. I weighed 210 pounds, much heavier than anyone else who had ever tried to break that record, and my probability of failure was high.

A lot of us surround ourselves with people who speak to our desire for comfort. Who would rather treat the pain of our wounds and prevent further injury than help us callous over them and try again. We need to surround ourselves with people who will tell us what we need to hear, not what we want to hear, but at the same time not make us feel we’re up against the impossible. My mother was my biggest fan. Whenever I failed in life she was always asking me when and where I would go after it again. She never said, Well, maybe it isn’t meant to be.

That wasn’t easy because after my second failure in as many attempts, the doubters were everywhere online. The record holder, Stephen Hyland, was light and spidery strong with thick, muscular palms. He was the perfect build for the pull-up record, and everyone was telling me I was just too big, my form was too brutal, and that I should stop trying to go for it before I hurt myself even worse. They pointed to the scoreboard that doesn’t lie. I was still over 800 pull-ups away from the record. That’s more than I gained between my first and second attempts. From the beginning some of them had predicted my hands would give out, and when that truth revealed itself in Nashville it presented a big mental hurdle. Part of me wondered if those motherfuckers were right. If I was trying to achieve the impossible.

*****************************************************************************
Then I thought of an English middle-distance runner from back in the day named Roger Bannister. When Bannister was trying to break the four-minute mile in the 1950s, experts told him it couldn’t be done, but that didn’t stop him. He failed again and again, but he persevered, and when he ran his historic mile in 3:59.4 on May 6, 1954, he didn’t just break a record, he broke open the floodgates simply by proving it possible. Six weeks later, his record was eclipsed, and by now over 1,000 runners have done what was once thought to be beyond human capability.

We are all guilty of allowing so-called experts, or just people who have more experience in a given field than we do, to cap our potential. One of the reasons we love sports is because we also love watching those glass ceilings get shattered. If I was going to be the next athlete to smash popular perception, I’d need to stop listening to doubt, whether it streamed in from the outside or bubbled up from within, and the best way to do that was to decide that the pull-up record was already mine. I didn’t know when it would officially become mine. It might be in two months or twenty years, but once I decided it belonged to me and decoupled it from the calendar, I was filled with confidence and relieved of any and all pressure because my task morphed from trying to achieve the impossible into working toward an inevitability. But to get there, I’d have to find the tactical advantage I’d been missing.

Nobody is forced to become a SEAL. They are not drafted. So the constant question when things are hard is "Why am I here ?". Self discipline is hard you will also ask yourself "Why am I doing this.

That’s one reason I invented the Cookie Jar. We must create a system that constantly reminds us who the fuck we are when we are at our best, because life is not going to pick us up when we fall. There will be forks in the road, knives in your fucking back, mountains to climb, and we are only capable of living up to the image we create for ourselves.

Prepare yourself!

We know life can be hard, and yet we feel sorry for ourselves when it isn’t fair. From this point forward, accept the following as Goggins’ laws of nature:

You will be made fun of.
You will feel insecure.
You may not be the best all the time.

The number one excuse I hear from people as to why they don’t work out as much as they want to is that they don’t have time. Look, we all have work obligations, none of us want to lose sleep, and you’ll need time with the family or they’ll trip the fuck out. I get it, and if that’s your situation, you must win the morning.

When I was full-time with the SEALs I maximized the dark hours before dawn. When my wife was sleeping, I would bang out a six- to ten-mile run. My gear was all laid out the night before, my lunch was packed, and my work clothes were in my locker at work where I’d shower before my day started at 7:30 a.m. On a typical day, I’d be out the door for my run just after 4 a.m. and back by 5:15 a.m. Since that wasn’t enough for me, and because we only owned one car, I rode my bike (I finally got my own shit!) twenty-five miles to work. I’d work from 7:30 a.m. to noon, and eat at my desk before or after my lunch break. During the lunch hour I’d hit the gym or do a four- to six-mile beach run, work the afternoon shift and hop on my bike for the twenty-five-mile ride home. By the time I was home at 7 p.m., I’d have run about fifteen miles, rocked fifty miles on the bike, and put in a full day at the office. I was always home for dinner and in bed by 10 p.m. so I could do it all over again the next day. On Saturdays I’d sleep in until 7 a.m., hit a three-hour workout, and spend the rest of the weekend with Kate. If I didn’t have a race, Sundays were my active recovery days. I’d do an easy ride at a low heart rate, keeping my pulse below 110 beats per minute to stimulate healthy blood flow.

Maybe you think I’m a special case or an obsessive maniac. Fine, I won’t argue with you. But what about my friend Mike? He’s a big-time financial advisor in New York City. His job is high pressure and his work day is a hell of a lot longer than eight hours. He has a wife and two kids, and he’s an ultra runner. Here’s how he does it. He wakes up at 4 a.m. every weekday, runs sixty to ninety minutes each morning while his family is still snoozing, rides a bike to work and back and does a quick thirty-minute treadmill run after he gets home. He goes out for longer runs on weekends, but he minimizes its impact on his family obligations.

He’s high-powered, wealthy as fuck, and could easily maintain his status quo with less effort and enjoy the sweet fruits of his labors, but he finds a way to stay hard because his labors are his sweetest fruits. And he makes time to get it all in by minimizing the amount of bullshit clogging his schedule. His priorities are clear, and he remains dedicated to his priorities. I’m not talking about general priorities here either. Each hour of his week is dedicated to a particular task and when that hour shows up in real time, he focuses 100 percent on that task. That’s how I do it too, because that is the only way to minimize wasted hours.

Evaluate your life in its totality! We all waste so much time doing meaningless bullshit. We burn hours on social media and watching television, which by the end of the year would add up to entire days and weeks if you tabulated time like you do your taxes. You should, because if you knew the truth you’d deactivate your Facebook account STAT, and cut your cable. When you find yourself having frivolous conversations or becoming ensnared in activities that don’t better you in any way, move the fuck on!

For years I’ve lived like a monk. I don’t see or spend time with a lot of people. My circle is very tight. I post on social media once or twice a week and I never check anybody else’s feeds because I don’t follow anyone. That’s just me. I’m not saying you need to be that unforgiving, because you and I probably don’t share the same goals. But I know you have goals too, and room for improvement, or you wouldn’t be reading my book, and I guarantee that if you audited your schedule you’d find time for more work and less bullshit.

It’s up to you to find ways to eviscerate your bullshit. How much time do you spend at the dinner table talking about nothing after the meal is done? How many calls and texts do you send for no reason at all? Look at your whole life, list your obligations and tasks. Put a time stamp on them. How many hours are required to shop, eat, and clean? How much sleep do you need? What’s your commute like? Can you make it there under your own power? Block everything into windows of time, and once your day is scheduled out, you’ll know how much flexibility you have to exercise on a given day and how to maximize it.

Perhaps you aren’t looking to get fit, but have been dreaming of starting a business of your own, or have always wanted to learn a language or an instrument you’re obsessed with. Fine, the same rule applies. Analyze your schedule, kill your empty habits, burn out the bullshit, and see what’s left. Is it one hour per day? Three? Now maximize that shit. That means listing your prioritized tasks every hour of the day. You can even narrow it down to fifteen-minute windows, and don’t forget to include backstops in your day-to-day schedule. Remember how I forgot to include backstops in my race plan at Ultraman? You need backstops in your day-to-day schedule too. If one task bleeds into overtime, make sure you know it, and begin to transition into your next prioritized task straight away. Use your smartphone for productivity hacks, not click bait. Turn on your calendar alerts. Have those alarms set.

If you audit your life, skip the bullshit, and use backstops, you’ll find time to do everything you need and want to do. But remember that you also need rest, so schedule that in. Listen to your body, sneak in those ten- to twenty-minute power naps when necessary, and take one full rest day per week. If it’s a rest day, truly allow your mind and body to relax. Turn your phone off. Keep the computer shut down. A rest day means you should be relaxed, hanging with friends or family, and eating and drinking well, so you can recharge and get back at it. It’s not a day to lose yourself in technology or stay hunched at your desk in the form of a damn question mark.

The whole point of the twenty-four-hour mission is to keep up a championship pace, not for a season or a year, but for your entire life! That requires quality rest and recovery time. Because there is no finish line. There is always more to learn, and you will always have weaknesses to strengthen if you want to become as hard as woodpecker lips. Hard enough to hammer countless miles, and finish that shit strong!

Acrylamide is formed when air frying potatoes for example. Up until now it's not a concern as carcinogen.

However there are glycotoxins(Advanced Glycation End Products) wich are formed when high fat and high protein foods are exposed to high temperatures. So hotdogs, chicked McNuggets etc. Bake an apple nothing happens no high fat and high protein. However there are high fat high protein plant foods, like tofu(no grilled tofu), nuts and seeds(we toast our walnuts, sesame seeds). We should eat them raw. Raw seeds, raw butters.
For example peanut butter, peanuts dry roasted, roasted in shell all have highe AGE

Chose steamed, boiled, raw etc.

// More on glycotoxins, Advanced Glycation End Products (AGE)

Modern diets are largely heat-processed and as a result contain high levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Dietary advanced glycation end products (dAGEs) are known to contribute to increased oxidant stress and inflammation, which are linked to the recent epidemics of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This report significantly expands the available dAGE database, validates the dAGE testing methodology, compares cooking procedures and inhibitory agents on new dAGE formation, and introduces practical approaches for reducing dAGE consumption in daily life. Based on the findings, dry heat promotes new dAGE formation by >10- to 100-fold above the uncooked state across food categories. Animal-derived foods that are high in fat and protein are generally AGE-rich and prone to new AGE formation during cooking. In contrast, carbohydrate-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and milk contain relatively few AGEs, even after cooking. The formation of new dAGEs during cooking was prevented by the AGE inhibitory compound aminoguanidine and significantly reduced by cooking with moist heat, using shorter cooking times, cooking at lower temperatures, and by use of acidic ingredients such as lemon juice or vinegar. The new dAGE database provides a valuable instrument for estimating dAGE intake and for guiding food choices to reduce dAGE intake.

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), also known as glycotoxins, are a diverse group of highly oxidant compounds with pathogenic significance in diabetes and in several other chronic diseases (1–6). AGEs are created through a nonenzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and free amino groups of proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids. This reaction is also known as the Maillard or browning reaction (7). The formation of AGEs is a part of normal metabolism, but if excessively high levels of AGEs are reached in tissues and the circulation they can become pathogenic (2). The pathologic effects of AGEs are related to their ability to promote oxidative stress and inflammation by binding with cell surface receptors or cross-linking with body proteins, altering their structure and function (8–10). Among the better-studied AGEs are the stable and relatively inert Nε-carboxymethyllysine (CML) and the highly reactive derivatives of methyl-glyoxal (MG). Both these AGEs can be derived from protein and lipid glycoxidation (11,12).

In addition to AGEs that form within the body, AGEs also exist in foods. AGEs are naturally present in uncooked animal-derived foods, and cooking results in the formation of new AGEs within these foods. In particular, grilling, broiling, roasting, searing, and frying propagate and accelerate new AGE formation (7,13). A wide variety of foods in modern diets are exposed to cooking or thermal processing for reasons of safety and convenience as well as to enhance flavor, color, and appearance. The fact that the modern diet is a large source of AGEs is now well-documented (3,7,13). Because it had previously been assumed that dietary AGEs (dAGEs) are poorly absorbed, their potential role in human health and disease was largely ignored. However, recent studies with the oral administration of a single AGE-rich meal to human beings as well as labeled single protein-AGEs or diets enriched with specific AGEs such as MG to mice clearly show that dAGEs are absorbed and contribute significantly to the body’s AGE pool (14–16).

Consumption of AGE-rich diets by mice is associated with elevated circulating and tissue AGEs and conditions such as atherosclerosis (17) and kidney disease (18). On the other hand, restriction of dAGEs prevents vascular and kidney dysfunction (18,19), diabetes type 1 or type 2 (20), improves insulin sensitivity (21,22), and accelerates wound healing (23). Low dAGE intake has also been shown to lengthen lifespan to the same extent as does energy restriction in mice (16). Studies in healthy human beings show that dAGEs directly correlate with circulating AGEs, such as CML and MG, as well as with markers of oxidative stress (24). Moreover, restriction of dAGEs in patients with diabetes (25) or kidney disease (26,27) as well as in healthy subjects (28) also reduces markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Together, the findings from animal and human studies suggest that avoidance of dAGEs in food helps delay chronic diseases and aging in animals and possibly in human beings (3).

From a practical perspective, aside from a few reports, which include an initial dAGE database on 249 foods (13), this area is void of relevant information and guidance for professionals. The purpose of this report is to expand the existing dAGE database by more than twofold, validate the methods used to test AGEs in food, examine different procedures and reagents on new dAGE formed, and introduce practical methods to reduce the consumption of dAGEs in daily life.

//
Habit of overstimulating our brain chemistry with substances and activities. With such a mindset, we’re innocently, but selfishly, focusing on ourselves.

// No alcohol or drugs when on wfpbd
If you are accustomed to drinking a bit of alcohol or smoking marijuana, try cutting back or avoiding it. As explained, the same brain circuitry that you have been activating with substances actually evolved to help you find nourishing contact with your fellow human beings rewarding. This is a rare opportunity to find out what bonding behaviors can do. Also, substances that alter clarity can sabotage the best of intentions, so they tend to slow progress.

What if you feel like snuggling when you are not officially doing an Exchange? Enjoy! Just avoid disrobing or genital contact ahead of schedule. Also resist vigorously rubbing your genitals on your partner or reaching into your partner’s clothing. Feeding-frenzy behavior will leave you hungrier than ever. Even lying on top of your partner can increase frustration at first. If you focus instead on your gratitude for having your partner in your arms, and genuinely pamper one another, you may find your contact surprisingly fulfilling.

// 
What if one of you has an orgasm during the time you’re experimenting with the Exchanges? Enjoy it, and trust that it is part of the learning curve. Congratulate yourselves on the time that you were able to experiment with Exchanges. Discuss any insights you may have gained from the experience.

Same for food. Don't beat yourself up, congratulate yourself for the time you managed to eat clean.

// **************************** Same for food. ************************************************
Please read the rest of the book before attempting the Exchanges. It’s very helpful to know why you’re trying something so unfamiliar. If you don’t know why, your subconscious mating program will continue to pull your strings.

// Highly potent sexual stimuli [and junk food] are the only stimuli capable of activating the dopamine system with anywhere near the potency of addictive drugs.

// It's sensations that give you high doses of dopamine that get you addicted. They don't even have to be real. Porn is not real sex, yet it can be addictive, fake sugars(sweeteners) that have no calories can also be addictive.

// A lot of people give advice about what you should and shouldn't eat, and they know very little about the subject, because there are no consequences if they are wrong. So if you give advice let's put it to the test, and if it's not true how about you suffer some consequences.

// Question, "What do you think ? Can a human live a long healthy life by eat only animal products or only whole foods plant based."

// Omnivores we are, but we come from a vegetarian background (not herbivore). That means we are not well adapted to a carnivore diet. The panda is also an omnivore that comes from a carnivore background, he is not well adapted to a herbivore diet(he eats bamboo, he tries to eat bamboo sprouts, where there is more protein undiluted by fiber). Bears are not well adapted to process cellulose so they go for plant food that is more easily absorbed and has a lot of nutrition.

// We are omnivores. Eating meat is natural, unfortunately it comes with trade offs. It serves your genes to survive and mate when you are young. You won't feel the effects only later, by that time you served your purpose.

// By avoiding food designed for intense taste sensations, you will increase your sensitivity. 
By avoiding the intense peaks of orgasm, I had enhanced my sensitivity.

// 
Where the sense wonder went from when we were kids. It went away because our programming started to take over and happiness is not written on it.

The reason kids are no longer cute when they grow up is because of the programming in their genes. The genetic code wants you to spread your seed, you will end in the grip of your genes many times and you won't notice. Your mission to spread your genes makes you selfish, mean, a person to avoid, etc, unless you learn how to balance yourself. 

// You can change, your partner can change.
IT ISN’T EASY BEING GREEN
No matter how froggy you or your partner may look from time to time, you are actually royalty in disguise. For example, Will amazed me. Years of slavery to his mood-altering habits had left him with a deeply embedded impression that he was, in fact, a frog. He had pretty much accepted the dimensions of his aquarium, padded it with a couple of substance dependencies, and hunkered down for the duration. Uncomfortable as it was, it was home. Despite his façade of enthusiasm for trying the Exchanges, he was skeptical about forsaking familiar territory in favor of “some pie-in-the-sky summit.”

Yet gradually, but steadily, as we stuck to our bonding-based lovemaking, he metamorphosed from a discouraged addict into a warm, insightful, recovered companion who is still my favorite teacher. The transition took time, but my belief in his power to transform himself was also a factor. These days, he masterfully soothes my ruffled feathers, or gets me laughing when I’m taking myself too seriously. We both feel very fortunate.

Before beginning, talk about what you experienced following the previous Exchange.

￼ Do you feel cherished? If so, tell your partner why. If not, what would make you feel more cherished?

￼ Are you able to enjoy your partner’s gifts of affection, or are you angling to see “what you can get away with?” Try to resist altering your own mood by seeking sensation, and see what it feels like to relax, receive, and give.

//*************************** Be consistent **************************
CONSISTENCY

When I trained my dog, consistency was more important than anything else. Otherwise, he naturally assumed that commands were mere suggestions. So it proved with my brain. I was trying to lay down a new habit. And I discovered that the more consistent I was, the more rapidly I got through the uncomfortable period of hyper-vigilance, and the sooner I could relax into the rewards.

// This also relates to food but I don't know how to express it. I'll think about it.
I think it's about consistency. If you fail, recognize the failure as a lesson, don't beat yourself up. Encourage yourself, next time do better, last longer. No compromises, make small goals so you are consistent in achieving them, work from there.
SHAKY COMPROMISES
I had a lot of experience with the Exchanges, because I was very good at rationalizing “harmless” departures from them. Often I did so in an effort to please my partner. I would think “I can sense we’re off the track here, but maybe if I’m especially accommodating this time, he’ll be equally generous next time, and will wholeheartedly try this other approach with me.”

Wrong. I was not helping my mate learn a new habit by ensuring he received a reward (worse yet, half a reward, if he managed to avoid orgasm) for moving toward his former habit of self-stimulation. Frustration merely increased his search for more stimulation. Not surprisingly, he became resentful and emotionally flat when we had to back up. Eventually, we had to go through a second, very uncomfortable period of withdrawal before we could make progress.

It may not be possible to transition to this new approach while continuing to trigger most of the usual foreplay rewards during lovemaking. After all, our mammalian brain is always there, and it has its own agenda. We can never teach it new songs. We can only teach ourselves (gradually) to listen to the bonding tune more than the mating tune.

// Avoid high intensity emotions produced by hedonism.
//*********************************
SELF-OBSERVATION
When I was climaxing all the time, I suffered from so many mood swings (euphoria, anxiety, resentment, wishful thinking, demands) and related self-doubts that my perception was unreliable. I also found it hard to pick out the key feelings that revealed the destructive and self-destructive patterns I needed to release.

The fewer passion cycles I trigger, the easier it is to spot the self-sabotaging thoughts—and the easier it is to see that they are as groundless as bad dreams that dissipate in the morning. Why? Because the rest of the time I feel balanced and loved, not anxious. Waves of intense feelings after an orgasm stick out as exceptions; they are not the rule. They can be helpful, pointing to anything holding me back from deeper intimacy. They show me what false beliefs are still in my way. This clearing process is natural, but therapists and energetic healing approaches can facilitate it.

You may soon be returning to conventional sex. When you do, keep track of your feelings for the first two weeks. Here are notes from two couples who made similar experiments. (Not to spoil your fun.…)

I have always been greatly bothered by knowing that my husband believes orgasm is natural and no problem, so recently I said, “Okay let’s try it for a month with orgasms, just to see.” I thought it would be good for me to let go of the fear of orgasm that the Samael Aun Weor classes had started by demonizing orgasms.

So we did twice have orgasms intentionally, and after that he said, “That’s enough. Can we please go back to what we have been doing?” He said this even though I was happy to continue experimenting. Our sex-without-orgasm practice is “making love” for him, whereas what just happened was “only sex.”

****************************************
For me the experiment was also a reminder that orgasms let out the lovely magical feeling you have built up during intercourse. Plus they are such an addictive thing; the next day annoying feelings of being in the mood for more kept interrupting my thoughts. Sex without orgasm leaves such a long-lasting satisfaction as compared to sex with orgasm that it is almost ironic.

My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant, so we keep going back and forth. Every hangover is worse than the last. Actually, I’m not sure if that is as much true as the fact that every period between hangovers, we get so much deeper, so much clearer and closer, that the hangover just seems worse than before. I do not know how I got along previously without this understanding.

Before beginning, talk about what you experienced following the previous Exchange.

￼ What did you like best about what your partner did while making love? Did anything surprise you?

￼ Did you feel adored? Did you feel satisfied today? How would you describe your feelings?

￼ Did you allow yourselves any periods of stillness to see if you could feel subtle or joyful energy moving?

￼ Did you stop making love when the energy stopped flowing, or try to stimulate each other back to another high? Try stopping when the energy stops.


// 
Seen from this new vantage point, visual stimulation, passionate kissing, traditional
foreplay, and vigorous intercourse were not inferior. They were just especially … fruitful. That is, over the millennia, those who engaged in them tended to produce more babies—with similar inclinations. So, thanks to all the fun our ancestors had (and all of today’s casual erotic stimulation), we have brains that immediately reward us for just thinking about such activities. Even more challenging is the fact that, once stimulated, we naturally crave more and more stimulation, and feel deprived if we do not dance to our mating program’s tune.

Fortunately, bonding behaviors, including karezza, offer a way around this mechanism.

//*****************
￼ Bonding behaviors are associated with a neurochemical called oxytocin.

￼ Oxytocin naturally counters stress, anxiety, depression, and defensiveness. It also soothes cravings. It is probably the reason that close, trusted—and especially, harmonious—companionship is associated with increased longevity, faster healing, and lower rates of illness, depression, and addiction.

￼ Lovers often attempt to use orgasm (or other addictive behaviors and/or substances) to medicate the discomfort resulting from modern life’s dwindling rewards of close companionship and satisfying intimacy. Bonding behaviors, including karezza, would be better mood medicine


//
MATING—THE “HABITUATION PEDAL”
￼ Our mating behavior is driven by a very old part of the brain, which we have in common with all mammals.

￼ Unlike the rational part of our brain, our mammalian brain can’t “think”; it operates on impulses.

￼ It is the seat of our reward circuitry, which is the mechanism that governs our drives, desires, and emotions. It is where we fall in—and out of—love.

￼ Falling in love causes neurochemical changes in the reward circuitry. Exciting honeymoon neurochemicals normally keep us slightly addicted to our lovers for as long as two years—although they can wear off at any time. On average, they last long enough to ensure that our children have two caregivers.

￼ No mammals are 100 percent monogamous, and very few pair up for life. Adding mates improves our genes’ chances of getting copies of themselves into the future. This, not our happiness, is their top priority.

￼ Sexual satiety (that “I’m done!” feeling) is a mechanism for causing mates to tire of each other. As the honeymoon neurochemistry wears off, the emotionally distancing effects of exhausting sexual desire become more apparent.

￼ Neurochemical fluctuations in the reward circuitry occur after orgasm. They can make a mate look less “rewarding,” and we may feel that we are falling out of love—at a gut level (habituation).

￼ At the same time, potential novel mates appear very attractive, because we receive a neurochemical jolt for turning our attention to them. This phenomenon—tiring of a mate with whom one sexually satiates oneself, but finding novel partners very attractive—has been observed in both male and female mammals.

The neurochemical fluctuations that follow sexual satiety last for approximately two weeks. They can cause changes in our feelings toward a mate.

This two-week passion cycle is sometimes very subtle, but it can make lovers feel unusually needy, anxious, drained, or irritable from time to time.

￼ Due to recurring discomfort during the passion cycle, we can begin to perceive our lover—or ongoing intimate relationships themselves—as a source of stress. Orgasm, however, will still register as a great idea.

￼ Especially in the case of superstimulation, such as Internet porn, risky sex, or forbidden sex, the low part of the passion cycle can be so uncomfortable that it causes a person to seek another orgasm in order to self-medicate.

￼ When repeated stimulation causes repeated lows, the search for relief via orgasm can become habitual, leading to oversensitivity to sexual cues and compulsive behavior.

￼ Reversing this process and restoring equilibrium can require weeks of abstinence from sexual stimuli and orgasm because of semi-permanent changes in the reward circuitry caused by a protein called ￼-FosB.

￼ Such things as bonding behaviors, contact with others, visualization techniques, exercise and meditation all ease the return to balance.




// Any intense feeling has the power to desensitize.
// 
MAXIMIZING PLEASURE
Once I transitioned to karezza, I required less stimulation to enjoy every aspect of my life. By avoiding the intense peaks of orgasm, I had enhanced my sensitivity. Simple pleasures were all around me, such as the glory of a sunset, the fun of watching dogs playing, the satisfaction of raising a flowering or vegetable-bearing plant, or the moving harmonies of live choral music.

The practice actually increased my daily pleasure quotient, even as it decreased the intensity of my lovemaking. This outcome is hard to imagine while hooked on orgasm (or any stimulus). Passing up those peaks at first seems like too big a sacrifice to make. Yet if the goal is more overall pleasure, then letting go of intense stimulation, with its hangover and pleasure-numbing effects, is a sound strategy.

//
Of course sexual relationships are chaotic at the moment. We overcame the dangers of sexual repression, but in the process taught ourselves to use sex as a mind-altering superstimulus that makes it easy to undervalue our pair-bonds

//
Why didn’t someone tell us that we have knowledge of the best possible diet for humans. A diet that leads to a long healthy life. Oh, they did, it's just that the mammal brain and reptilian brain got in the way and we rationalized eating unhealthy but tasty food as healthy, or we downplayed the dangers of animal products and processed food.

// Animal products putrefy in our intestines, because they are too long compared to carnivores. Putrefying bacteria is formed after animal products consumption. There are also viruses and bacteria in animal products that may survive cooking and end up in humans.

// Our modern lives may engage the sympathetic nervous system more often and for longer periods of time than normal. At the same time our old ways of reliving stress like, time spent in social interaction with our close groups is becoming less and less or nonexistent.

// To engage the sympathetic nervous system try diaphragm breathing, slow breaths, lion breath, relax abdomen, shoulders, back, stretching.

// Adjust workstation so you don't create stiff muscles and other problems.

// wfpbd should be tasty and filling enough as a consequence it eases compulsion. If you deny the primal urges you will be under heavy compulsion. Besides you will get used to it.

// Be careful of forbidding, everything forbidden may register as possible very stimulating and you might want to pursue it badly.

// If you want your kids to eat well you will have to lead by example. You don't want to be in a situation of "Do what the priest says not what he does.". They can smell hypocrisy and say "This is not fair".

// You can easily injure or kill a plant when it's in the growing phase. Even if it survives, a lot of times it's growth is no longer reaches it's normals potential. The same things for animals and humans, injured when they are developing they will have their potential crippled.

// Addictions can lead to death.
Sex is like fire or water. Fire and water can aid a man … or kill him.
—Taoist proverb

// Your gut bacteria expects fibers(plural) not fiber. There are different kinds.

// 
Make sure you did not mess up your intestinal bacteria. There are people that getting weaker and weaker from eating plant based. Turns out the beneficial bacteria in the gut died, unable to extract nutrients and energy from plant based food they grew weaker. But they realized that if they eat meat they have their energy back. This is a trap, if you cant process plant food eventually your health will crumble and you will die if you don't get your beneficial gut bacteria back. Humans can live without animal food but not plant food.

// Instead of searching for empty high dopamine activities that burn you out, look for rewarding activities that provide less intense sensations but you do a lot of them and you get stability, like a gentle fire.
Instead of reaching climax all at once and in an irreversible way, the couple can enjoy many less intense sensations, which, together, produce boundless joy and pleasure.

Using karezza’s gentle intercourse, lovers discover that they can make love for as long as they need to until any sexual tension melts away entirely—as long as they don’t fall back into hungry behavior. During lovemaking, the emphasis is on stillness and heart-centered feelings. If the energy begins to build into goal-oriented sensations, lovers simply relax back into stillness. The feelings during these quiet periods can be especially profound, as if the couple has entered a timeless cocoon of delighted contentment.

If people have the right to be tempted—and that’s what free will is all about—the market is going to respond by supplying as much temptation as can be sold. Market incentive continues well beyond the point where a superstimulus begins wreaking collateral damage on the consumer.—Eliezer Yudkowsky

Are forced orgasms and sexual performance the best solution? Might less trigger-happy lovers simply be better suited to a gentler approach that relies chiefly on the rewards of bonding behaviors and trusted companionship for pleasure and satisfaction? Can we make ourselves more comfortable, sensual, and fulfilled just by changing how we soothe each other’s mammalian brains?*

While we’re waiting for everyone to get the memo on the importance of pair-bonds and alternative approaches to lovemaking, watch out! America’s experience with cigarettes and fast food360 suggests that humans are very good at researching and exploiting what excites the reward circuitry of their fellow humans—and very bad at acknowledging the disorders that follow from the resulting excess. As portrayed in the documentaries Super Size Me and Adult Entertainment: Disrobing an American Idol, when big business caters to the profitable cravings of the mammalian brain, we can anticipate heavy marketing of, and lobbying for, the addictive and the unhealthy.

Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.

//
Our mammalian mating and bonding programs are like two pedals that drive our intimate relationships. The mating program (the urge to exhaust ourselves sexually as often as possible) is the “habituation pedal,” because it so often causes partners to get fed up with (habituate to) each other. The bonding program, on the other hand, is the “harmony pedal,” because it increases balance and makes togetherness more deeply satisfying. With this simple knowledge, we can more consciously steer toward whatever results we choose.

My wife and I have been on the non-orgasmic journey for 12 years. I never tire of her, and pretty much can never get enough of her. I appreciate and enjoy her feminine way much more than when I was ejaculating. Women used to be a kind of aggravation; I’d fluctuate between the extremes of desire and “You’re driving me nuts.

//
The power to make love, which man alone possesses, … distinguishes him from the rest of the animal species. However, when he misuses this unique creative gift … he taps back into his animal past, into the mechanical animal drive, and masturbates or mates without love. He is then unhappy.

//
The cure for inflamed libido is much like the cure for poison ivy: “Don’t scratch, use lots of soothing lotion (oxytocin-producing behaviors), and turn your intense concentration elsewhere, while you wait for healing to occur.”

“WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS SURPLUS?”
One reason people often believe that orgasm is purely a beneficial outlet is that it seems to solve the problem of too much sexual energy—or perhaps too much semen if you’re male. This impression seems irrefutable, in part because wet dreams are a natural phenomenon of adolescence. It’s logical to assume that the urge to ejaculate is proof that the body is making extra semen with nowhere else to go. However, as Dr. Lloyd pointed out (see the Wisdom section between Chapters Seven and Eight), semen that is cut off from its natural outlet does not cause a swelling.

I’ve long had a predilection for an “orgasm nightcap” in response to my insomnia (when my wife wouldn’t have sex). Two weeks into stopping orgasm and guess what? I am sleeping just fine! More and more, I am less inclined to see my beloved orgasm as the wonderful stress-relieving elixir I once did.—Marc

Females (no semen) also experience dream orgasms. All of this suggests that there’s more to dream orgasms than excretion of a liquid surplus. Perhaps, in both sexes, such dreams are “dress rehearsals,” which also naturally increase libido—due to post-orgasmic cravings in the form of increased sexual tension. Our genes, after all, want us ready for action. Perhaps they’re also signals that we need to find a deeply satisfying pair-bond.

The common belief that orgasm is merely a healthy outlet has a hidden risk. It encourages us to solve the dilemma of the phantom excess with deliberate masturbation. Without realizing it, we can, with frequent orgasm, overstimulate a very compelling pathway in the brain. As we saw in Chapter Six, this can lead to an uncomfortable cycle of ever more demanding urges, even though it briefly relieves the pressure. (If you are one of those people, realize that it may be because you haven’t been engaging in enough bonding behaviors. It would probably help to reach out and touch someone … else.)

Excess libido is a brain event more than a body event. Horniness feels like you’re stuck uncomfortably at the top of a roller coaster. However, beneath this restlessness is the genuine need to relieve sexual tension through intimate contact. Nourishing, non-goal-driven contact decreases tension, countering anxiety and stress naturally. This means that affectionate contact, not necessarily orgasm, will help most, if longer lasting contentment is a goal. The next most soothing option is friendly, less intimate, interaction with others.

Isolation is one of the root causes of addiction. I don’t attend any recovery groups, but what I do attend is social events within my school, and I’ve also gained a social circle, something I’ve never had. So, for the first time, I have a group of people I know who actually care about me. Now, I find I’m finally willing to remove every last bit of the negative sexual stuff from my mind. In fact, I’ve lost my taste for porn and nasty fantasy. To my surprise, I’ve been clean now for five and a half weeks, and hopefully for the rest of my life.—Nick

To recap, the feeling of excess, or surplus, often arises from an overactivated brain pathway, which is throwing dopamine levels out of whack, as explained in Chapters Five and Six. It’s like a faulty keyboard letter that gets stuck every time you hit it and types out the same letter nonstop. Think back to your first orgasms. They probably just happened. They set their own natural rhythm.

The overactivated brain pathway is likely to be your handiwork. (Good job!) However it happens, once you begin to force orgasm with highly stimulating activities, you strengthen a brain pathway that automatically seeks the same (or even more stimulating) relief repeatedly.

If you are in this situation, you can’t rid yourself of the phantom surplus by means of more orgasms. Despite short-term relief (when your high dopamine drops after climax), this strategy is likely to numb your pleasure response during the remainder of the passion cycle. You will be primed for any thought or visual cue that your brain associates with arousal or oblivion. Indeed, your brain may helpfully prompt you with a flashback image at low points in the cycle. This kind of help you don’t need. You’ll go from uncomfortably low dopamine to mind-altering high dopamine in a flash. Now you feel like you have a huge surplus of libido and/or semen, and no choice but to find relief by the fastest means at hand (literally).

The bottom line is that a superhuman libido, frequent wet dreams, and hair-trigger orgasms can be indications of receptor depletion (and related neurochemcial events)—even though they feel like evidence of excess. The Chinese Taoists discovered this paradox and its surprising solution (avoiding frequent orgasm) many years ago.

A year ago (pre-porn use), I could easily regulate my rate of masturbation, and thus orgasm, to, say, once a week, and during periods of sustained spiritual endeavor, could even go for a month without it. Now I’m feeling like a wild bull—multiple times every day! I don’t understand how I missed it before; this is actually unnatural.—Ross

The solution is not simple, and it may take time—depending upon how intensely you have, quite logically, tried to solve your discomfort with more orgasm. The ultimate solution lies in your brain. Avoid excessive sexual stimuli, and do your best not to initiate orgasm (although it may continue to happen inadvertently while your brain is returning to balance). Three weeks may be enough to restore your equilibrium, but you could need many weeks longer, depending upon changes in your brain. When you have returned to balance, the cravings will be far less intense. See Chapter Six for tips on how to refocus your attention when urges arise. By rechanneling the urge to initiate orgasm, you don’t strengthen the circuitry in your brain that is tapping out those false “surplus” alerts.

An enjoyable side effect of abstinence from porn and tossing off is the welcome resurgence of electrical energy between myself and real three-dimensional living and breathing women. You know, the kind that look you in the eyes and smile back.… It’s harmless, subtle flirting but it feels good to me.—Al

At the same time ease your cravings! Avoid the stressful feelings of withdrawal (low dopamine) to the extent you can, using oxytocin-producing activities. Sharing your favorite bonding behaviors with a sweetheart is ideal for this purpose, but other activities also produce comforting oxytocin. Here’s a soothing-activity list derived from research on oxytocin.344 A complete list would no doubt be much longer.

 Voluntary exercise

 Harmonious interactions with others

 Support group meetings

 Caring for pets

 Voluntary generosity

 Inspiring scenery

 Pleasant smells (pine forest, bread baking)

 Calming music, singing, and tango dancing!

 Warm and supportive touch, therapeutic massage

 Companionship

 Yoga and meditation

All of these experiences are rewarding, but not superstimulating. Make your own list of things you enjoy; include things that don’t throw you into an addictive cycle. (In other words, go lightly on the refined sugar, alcohol, gambling, video games, and so forth.) Refer to your list when your mammalian brain tries to urge you toward another cycle of “relief.”

Remember when you loved somebody so much that you would do something to make them happy even if you didn’t get rewarded? That feeling is coming back.—Curtis

The cure for inflamed libido is much like the cure for poison ivy: “Don’t scratch, use lots of soothing lotion (oxytocin-producing behaviors), and turn your intense concentration elsewhere, while you wait for healing to occur.”

[Nine days into experiment] Emotionally I am stronger. I have fewer moments where I loathe some aspect of another or myself. I can focus for longer periods. I wrote a six-page paper in a single sitting, and it only took three hours. Wonderful! It was one of the better papers I’ve written in college, too. I am very much loving this self-discovery. I sum it up as: less moody and self-absorbed, more active and life-loving.


//
Whether or not a sense of aligning with a higher power arises, karezza offers lovers other gifts. Some report that they begin to see each other differently. When you love someone unconditionally (not for your own ends), it shifts your perception of that person. This loving perception appears to be heavy on the feel-good neurochemistry of oxytocin, endorphins, and ideal levels of dopamine.363 When in this loving state, it is easy to see a reflection of your own open heart in another. (This same state of mind may explain why devotees see a divine glow around their spiritual teachers.) By keeping subconscious uneasiness out of lovemaking, lovers can begin to sense a glow in each other.

//************************************************************************
TAKING IT EASY
With karezza you never suppress orgasm. You allow yourself to relax as often as necessary instead. If some aspect of lovemaking is too stimulating, you back up to a less stimulating position or motion—even if that means terminating intercourse for the time being. (A Taoist manual even advised the extreme measure of keeping a bowl of ice water by the bed for the man to dip his penis in. Not recommended!) The most satisfying feelings arise during the relaxation phase—not near the edge of orgasm. Intense arousal just produces frustration. The fact that deep satisfaction can be found in stillness means that sexual performance is irrelevant. Also, as my husband points out, there’s no need to wonder about comparisons with former lovers, because karezza lovers are on an entirely different playing field. Even intercourse is optional. Couples have experienced profound feelings from ecstatic touch or gazing into each other’s eyes, alone.

During intercourse with karezza, there’s no good reason to go near the edge of orgasm. Indeed, there are good reasons not to. Flirting with “the edge” is a return to the habit of substituting a mind-altering buzz for the joy of shared experience. It can increase frustration, even if no one climaxes. Frustration equates with high dopamine, but when dopamine goes too high, further changes may numb the pleasure response, producing tension, resentment, and cravings. Going too close to orgasm can also build congestion in the genitals, which may cause sharp pains. If you are fighting yourself, you are going too close to orgasm. If you are male, you are also putting unhealthy stress on your prostate gland. Relax!

Good ways to relax are to take deep, full breaths, and to turn your attention to the root of your penis, or your breasts (if female).361a This helps you avoid the trap of using your encounter as a self-stimulating rush, and increases your production of comforting mood medicine.

Your mammalian brain may be telling you that you will feel more frustrated the longer you avoid orgasm. Yet if you experiment carefully, using lots of bonding behaviors, you are likely to find that this is not true.


//**************************************************************************************
PAIR-BONDING MANDATE
Love is a need—at least for pair-bonders like us. In contrast, ninety-five percent of mammalian species are cheerfully promiscuous. They don’t get much buzz from pair-bonding. They just get the usual dopamine surge from mating (and other survival activities, such as eating and drinking). Mating casually doesn’t leave them with a nagging sense that something is missing. We, however, compose love songs and line up at the box office to watch romantic films.

The world’s most reliable solo-orgasm supply won’t completely satisfy the average human. Even if he firmly believes he doesn’t need a mate, and even if she thinks she is as happy as a fish without a bicycle, there’s an empty hole at a neurochemical level. Our brain is flashing uncomfortable “something is missing” signals. For us, mating is ideally a pair-bonding exercise, because it improves the chances of survival of any offspring. We’re wired this way, all things being equal.

For example, a large 2006 study of German-speaking Swiss found that most of the singles were only without partners because they hadn’t found a suitable one. More than half stated that something is missing and almost two thirds wished for a fixed relationship.334 Roughly three-quarters already lived in a fixed relationship, although partnership duration was declining with each generation. Shorter, more casual romances do not constitute a healthy trend for pair-bonding mammals like us because of the inevitable gaps between partners.

Recent research suggests that pair-bonding mammalian species are more susceptible to depression335 and addiction336 than promiscuous species. The same neural circuitry that governs pair-bonding also governs susceptibility to these disorders, and pair-bonders seem to have a more sensitive version of it than most mammals. Scientists saw this recently when they compared the effects of amphetamine on two types of voles: pair-bonding prairie voles and promiscuous montane voles. Dopamine rose significantly more in response to the drug use in the pair-bonding voles than in the voles who were not wired to seek long-term mates. The monogamous voles were inclined to find certain dopamine-based rewards more rewarding than their promiscuous vole cousins.

￼
Women in steady relationships, according to a study published in the December 2008 issue of Current Sexual Health Reports, are far more likely than their single peers to feel comfortable with their natural appearance below the belt—and that comfort translates into higher scores on six separate measures of satisfaction between the sheets.

—Time magazine

This suggests that lonely pair-bonders have a greater risk of becoming addicts than would mammals with no built-in urge to form a pair-bond. The “neurochemical hole” described above appears to be very real indeed.

The neural mechanism common to both bonding and substance abuse didn’t evolve for addictions; it’s there for love (pair-bonding).

Alas, we humans do not necessarily interpret this craving as a “go forth and bond” signal. Unlike other pair-bonding mammals, we are quite likely to jam a square peg into a round hole by seeking out a substitute, healthy or unhealthy. Some of us do this with lots of friends. Some with therapeutic massage or tango classes. Mother Theresa did it her way. But all of us have to address this “little hole” somehow. Nature abhors an aching heart.

The situation is risky because our reward circuitry has one fundamental way to motivate us: dopamine surges. It’s therefore easy for us to conclude that the more our chosen substitute stimulates our reward circuitry, the more comfort we have found. We’re therefore easily tempted by alcohol, drugs, and emotionally empty sexual stimuli—especially if we have come to associate intimacy with pain, or we don’t yet know how soothing bonding behaviors can be.

￼
It seems likely that these pathways and genes evolved not for drug abuse, but for mediating the motivational aspects of social interaction, including pair bonding.

—Thomas R. Insel, MD, behavioral neuroscientist

Could this help explain why single men are more than three times as likely as married men to die of cirrhosis of the liver, and why seventy percent of chronic problem drinkers are either divorced or separated?337 Conversely, emotional bonds help ward off cravings for addictive substances and behaviors. In a seven-year study of 800 young adults, depression and alcohol abuse declined more significantly for those who married during that time.338 Cohabitors, too, enjoy significantly lower levels of psychological distress than individuals with no partner or those with a partner living outside the household.339 Benefits may stem from lower cortisol.339a

//************************************
The bottom line is that our compulsions spring not just from our mating program (drive to fertilize), but also from our built-in longings for a pair-bond and other beneficial social interactions. It’s ironic that if we were truly a promiscuous species, instead of pair-bonders who fool around sporadically, we would likely be less susceptible to addiction. We wouldn’t have this added sensitivity—that is, this emptiness to fill. (We would probably also still have brains small enough to enable one parent to rear a healthy child without disadvantage. After all, pair-bonding evolved because it offered the evolutionary advantage of permitting offspring with larger brains.)

The important point is that the majority of us are supposed to be uncomfortable when we are without mates. Just as we’re supposed to be hungry or thirsty when we need to eat or drink. Few of us are wired for a life of isolation or one-night stands, however convenient it would be if we were. Our discomfort is a signal that we need to reach out to potential companions not just if they look like alluring genetic opportunities—but because they are “good medicine” when we cultivate them as trusted, long-term companions. If we don’t connect, we risk being powerfully drawn to other sources of stimulation in our search for comfort


Yesterday my boyfriend said he always seemed to feel less need to masturbate when in a [pre-sex]relationship. He was like, “although, you’d think in some ways the desire would be greater.” I was like, “No, I feel the same way.”—Suzie

In recent decades many of us have been trying to fill our longing for love with mere sex, or even mere orgasm. Alas, neither addresses our subconscious need for a pair-bond. In fact, it can easily carry us away from nourishing connection with a mate by speeding up the habituation effect. (Of course, many of us got it just right with a sensual, loving relationship, and then watched in dismay as our underlying mating program eventually shattered our mutual source of well-being despite all efforts to preserve it.)

The most effective solution may be right in front of us: mating behavior that doesn’t trigger habituation and the desire for a novel mate. Contented union employing karezza could be the most reliable way to satisfy both our built-in “I need sex” signal and our built-in “I need ongoing companionship” signal.


// ***************************************
ADDICTION AND CIVILIZATION
Back in the eighteenth century, when attempts to self-medicate with substances and activities began their ominous surge, observers referred to compulsions as “diseases of civilization.” In the sexual arena, they pointed to the distinction between sex with a person and sex with one’s imagination. The participation of a partner naturally set a brake on excess in the form of partner availability, family demands, financial constraints, or the burden of arranging trysts. Do-it-yourself sex, on the other hand, had no inherent limit, and could more easily become compulsive. Some realized that one solution was not to tamper with nature, and keep the emphasis on union. Intercourse based on “natural needs” (and mutual agreement) was thought to be more beneficial than intercourse, or orgasm, produced with imagination or other self-stimulation.323

In short, our assumption may be wrong that humans have generally used orgasm as mood-altering relief, happily climaxing to satiety whenever aroused, alone or with a partner, and without ill effect. Indeed, anthropologist A. Ernest Crawley records that tribal cultures all over the world believed that temporary abstinence from sex was appropriate in connection with many activities. These included hunting, warfare, planting, fishing, harvesting, wine preparation, shamanic deeds, pilgrimage, the first days of marriage, pregnancy, lactation, menstruation, and so forth. Often believed to increase abundance as well as male invincibility and vigor, such periodic abstinence was so widespread that Crawley characterized temporary chastity as an “infallible nostrum for all important undertakings and critical junctures.”324

The modern, nonstop pursuit of orgasm may be a fairly recent loop in a spiral we’ve only recently recognized. Neurohistorian Daniel Lord Smail points out that one can view the entire history of civilization as an accelerating trend toward greater use of mood-altering (psychotropic) substances and activities, including shopping sprees and gorging on empty calories. Pursuit of frequent orgasm is one among many—although a particularly compelling one.325 In keeping with Smail’s observation, libido (or novelty seeking) is one area where our brains have been evolving unusually quickly in the last ten thousand years.326 The key point is that this dreary historical trend toward self-medication with stimulants isn’t just bad luck. It arose as our reassuring connections with others eroded, and we lost the neurochemical balance those connections afforded.

//
THE IDEAL MOOD MEDICINE
Hijacking the reward circuitry of our brains in search of our missing comfort has become such a familiar habit that we have lost sight of that circuitry’s true purpose. It’s there to urge us closer to deeply gratifying contact with our fellow humans. Unlike grizzlies, we don’t thrive on solitude. Research reveals that too little friendly contact with others increases our susceptibility to addiction.327

Yet on the bright side, the mammalian brain is molded to function contentedly without extra stimulation when adequate rewards come from daily activities. For example, rats that exercise a lot can’t be bothered to work hard for the reward of cocaine, while sedentary rats pursue it however much effort is required.328 In the case of our ancestors, daily rewards probably included not only friendly interaction and feelings of support, but also exercise, closer contact with nature, and the satisfaction of mastering skills and crafts.

I think what is erotically charged has double and triple power in a culture increasingly disconnected from the senses. When I feel sexually starved it is not that I am really starved for sex per se, but that I miss being connected to the world through every sense. I feel amputated. I could be compulsive and just hook up with someone, but I know this would sate nothing. My agitation (which shows up as sexual frustration) is due to the fact that I am increasingly pulled into a lifestyle that denies my sensual side.—Charlene

Eventually two doting caregivers became a survival advantage—as human babies came to be born “prematurely” so their bigger brains could pass through Mom’s pelvis. Our brains changed to promote pair-bonding, becoming more sensitive to the highs from sex and love. While all kinds of wholesome activities that once improved our ancestors’ state of mind also no doubt improve ours, a harmonious pair-bond became one of the most important determinants of happiness.329 In fact, trusted companionship does more to protect our well-being than increased exercise, better diet, our individual genetic blueprint, stopping smoking, or prescription drugs.330

In contrast, loneliness throws the body and brain of both men and women out of balance. It can become a downward spiral according to Loneliness authors John Cacioppo and William Patrick. For example, people with few ties to others are more likely to die from restricted flow of blood to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Loneliness predicts changes in our gene activation, which shift our cells’ sensitivity to cortisol, dampening our ability to turn off the body’s inflammatory response (a cause of cardiovascular disease). This means the lonely person is actually less able to absorb the stress-reducing benefits that others derive from the comfort and intimacy of their human contacts. Resilience and recovery also suffer. Even when the lonely got the same quantity of sleep as the non-lonely, their quality of sleep was greatly diminished.

Men and women with few ties to others were two to three times more likely to die in a nine-year follow-up period than those who had many more contacts. They died not just from cardiovascular disease, but from all causes of death. In short, social isolation is on a par with high blood pressure, obesity, lack of exercise, or smoking as a risk factor for illness and early death.331 Did you get your hug or pet your cat today?

[Comments of two recovering porn addicts] Days when I have had much communication with other people are usually days with a pretty calming end, where I do not need porn. Days when I have little contact for whatever reason, porn is harder to resist, as if I can make up for a lonely day by watching some porn or having a quick wank. —Kyle

On days when I am purposefully engaged in the service of others I am less likely to do porn. So now I realize that I should be focusing on participation in wholesome activities, not simply on abstaining from porn.—Adrian

In some sense, the history of civilization has been the sad story of our descent from the trusted companionship and sensual connection we need to thrive—into an escalating search for substitute mood medicine.

I lost thirty pounds with very little effort while I was in a relationship. Since it ended two years ago, I’ve gained back fifteen, and have a very hard time shedding any of it.—Chantal

One substitute “mood medicine” is pursuit of casual sex. It’s easy to miss the potential stressfulness of brief flings, because they offer temporary, mood-altering relief. They feel like the cure for anxiety, because they are, in fact, steps on a healthy trajectory. Yet using encounters purely for sexual relief naturally accelerates the tendency to undervalue each connection in favor of pursuing a novel one.

￼
58 percent of women and 23 percent of men regretted their one-night stands.332

If loneliness is lethal, then sexual encounters that are empty of sustained bonding behaviors—and still interspersed with periods of stressful loneliness—may do little to reduce our overall levels of anxiety.

Loneliness is damaging within relationships, too. For example, a study was done of almost ten thousand married men with chest pain (angina). Among those with high risk factors—elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, age, diabetes, and irregular heartbeat—there was almost twice as much angina in the group of men who answered “No” to the question “Does your wife show you her love?”


// **************************************************************************************************
MAMMALIAN BRAIN PAIN AND THE CASE FOR KAREZZA
To understand why generous bonding behaviors and karezza are likely to be even better mood medicine than orgasm, we need to peer back into our distant past. Warning: We’re going to cover a lot of history very quickly. Yet without this history, it’s difficult to understand why moving to karezza is a loving act, and not an act of deprivation.

To recap, our brains evolved over millions of years. During much of that time we lived in small primate bands. Survival depended not just on enthusiasm for reproduction, but also on mutual support and willingness to engage in close companionship with others. Living alone meant death (for our genes, too). Our mammalian brain rewards us for touch and companionship—meaning they make us feel good. This is important information, because we’re stuck with this brain. Ten thousand years is scarcely the blink of an eye—evolutionarily speaking.

What happened about ten thousand years ago? The march away from our hunter-gatherer lifestyle toward modern civilization began. Despite cell phones, books on relationships, and roller blades, civilization has hidden costs. One cost is that our mammalian brain has lost its ideal lifestyle. Important sources of rewarding feelings have slipped away, steadily increasing our levels of stress and anxiety. “Something is missing” feelings make the search for mood medicine increasingly urgent. Some of us have naturally used orgasm to medicate our distress (in addition to other mood-altering activities and stimulants).

Primate brains are molded to find friendly touch, personal relationships, and hanging out with others both rewarding (dopamine) and comforting (oxytocin, endorphins). Why? Taking pleasure in close contact favors the survival of a tribe (or troop), as well as the survival of infants. If Africa’s Bushmen and arctic Eskimos are any indication, we devoted much of our day to this source of mood medicine for most of human existence. Indeed, today’s wild primates still spend much of their time grooming and, in the case of bonobos, rubbing genitals on each other. These activities are rewarded because of their power to maintain vital social bonds and reduce stress. For example, low-ranking males spend a lot of time grooming to reduce the stress of being picked on by the big boys.

Maybe our ancestors’ bonds with mates proved only temporarily fulfilling. After all, there was probably no selection pressure for lifelong unions because of the evolutionary advantage of having offspring with different partners. But our forebears’ supply of friendly, or otherwise rewarding, interaction was all around them. (Think hunts, years of nursing each infant, tattooing one another, elaborate hairdressing, celebrations, and rituals.)

Ten thousand years ago, these health-giving aspects of daily life began to dry up. Most of us gradually settled into agrarian lifestyles, which led to insular families. We lost our tribes, and the healthy emotional transparency and conflict resolution skills of tribal life. Then, three to four hundred years ago, we began migrating into cities. As we grew more mobile, many of us also lost our extended families and our roots (our comforting sense of belonging, or connection with others).

We also forfeited hours of daily contact with our kids, who often went into factories themselves or boarding schools. This decreased both their opportunity to engage in bonding behaviors with familiar, trusted family members and their future tendency to engage in bonding behaviors themselves. Monkeys that lack comforting caregivers as infants make terrible parents.

This trend may explain how Harlow’s peers came to undervalue comforting touch, and why we have trouble recognizing the power and importance of bonding behaviors in our relationships today. Bonding behaviors don’t come naturally to us if we didn’t learn them as children. This unfortunate trend continues with fragile relationships, working moms, single-parent families, and kids who aren’t receiving enough bonding contact to build the resilience they need to cope with stress later in life.

￼
If psychological well-being is linked with having deep intimate contacts, being a valued member of an enduring social group, and being enmeshed in a network of extended kin, then the conditions of modern living seem designed to interfere with human happiness.

—David M. Buss, psychologist

//
NEW LIFESTYLE, NEW COMPULSIONS
When we moved off the farm, our use of mood-altering stimulants gained sharp momentum—particularly in the direction of self-stimulation. Now, for the first time in history, stimulants, old and new, became widely available: tobacco, chocolate, rum, gambling, shopping, and financial speculation. (These can still be found at your neighborhood convenience store, of course.) It is perhaps significant that there was no term in the English language for “addiction” prior to this time.

We also began to medicate our moods with pornography, novels about passionate romance—and frequent masturbation. Obviously, masturbation wasn’t a new idea, but, prior to the eighteenth century, no one saw it as likely to lead to a troubling addiction, except for the occasional sexually segregated cleric. Now people noticed that more folks were becoming hooked on all sorts of behaviors that were not serving them, single-minded pursuit of orgasm included. The resulting compulsions were unfamiliar and scary because they were not easy to overcome. There weren’t any Twelve-Step programs either.

It’s useful to keep in mind that the panicky cultural reaction to sexual compulsion began not because sex and masturbation were seen as “sinful.” Indeed, the Church was a relative latecomer to the debate. It began because people were deeply concerned with stemming the sharp rise in habit-forming, harmful excesses.314 Masturbation was by no means the only one, but it was the easiest for children to fall prey to. Hence the understandable, if misguided, admonition that sex was to be used only for procreation. Keep in mind that without a clear understanding of how orgasm interacts with the brain, there was no comprehensible justification for moderation.

Fears about compulsive masturbation were first publicized in regard to kids in boarding schools, many of whom were already anxious due to unnatural deprivation of contact with families and peers of the opposite sex. One reaction—with truly tragic results—was a virulent outcry against “self-pollution.” Generations of lonely, displaced children were raised to view the search for relief from sexual urges via masturbation as a moral failing, rather than as a natural activity that merits foresighted management. Unfortunately, if they later found partners, the link between sexual desire and “vice” didn’t always magically vanish. One unhealthy outcome was fear of sex itself, which, as we have seen, can make sexual stimuli abnormally compelling.

Why you shouldn't mess with neurochemicals(hormones, neurotransmitters), the shotgun approach, this also
works for eating animal products(you are taking in the hormones)

OXYTOCIN ISN’T A “LOVE DRUG”
You may wonder how researchers did most of the oxytocin experiments related to bonding. They piped it (or drugs that neutralized it) directly into rodents’ brains—onto spots no larger than peppercorns. However, even if you could pipe it into an unloving mate’s brain, you’d have to squirt it in every time you were together. Bonds are only created when oxytocin is consistently released in response to a particular person.

Next time you read about the wonders of oxytocin, keep in mind that the only feasible way to deliver it to anyone’s brain today is by way of a nasal spray—and that is not such a good idea. Such sprays have been used for a long time to induce milk letdown, but the oxytocin ends up all over the brain and circulating in the blood.

In contrast, your body delivers neurochemicals in just the right amount, precisely to the places they are needed, for as long as they are needed, and then quickly disposes of them. A shotgun approach can cause unintended consequences and alter the brain itself. A rise in oxytocin in a minuscule part of a mother rat’s brain causes her to guard her young fiercely. The same rise one-tenth of an inch away makes her passive.277 Manipulating humans with oxytocin is also dodgy. When scientists tried to relieve symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder long-term, using oxytocin nasal spray, it caused severe memory disturbances, psychotic symptoms, and marked changes in blood sodium levels.278 In another experiment it brought on high blood sugar (diabetes)

// BRIDGING THE GAP
￼
As we humans have lost the rewarding companionship that is the perfect “mood medicine” for our mammalian brains, compulsions have increased. Oxytocin-producing behaviors ease these compulsions.


//
People like to believe or they are lead to believe that all or almost all sickness strike randomly. Sure there are many types of illnesses, where you can say, those people or you had bad luck, there was nothing that could be done. But in the modern world most illnesses(including those that lead to death) are caused by food. By eating the wrong food we create so many problems to our bodies that is incredible. And we keep doing that, because we don't see the damage inside.  

// Find ways to raise oxytocin levels
Touching your lover with intent to comfort does two things. First, it creates a space of coziness and safety, which will allow your lover to open up to you again over time. Second, it can actually ease your sexual tension. This paradox is at the heart of karezza, and likely related to oxytocin’s unique power to soothe and reduce cravings. (More in the next chapter.)

Later I learned that, according to neuroimmunophysiologist Monika Fleshner, your brain will register more eager anticipation for a new regime (that is, start to produce a healthy amount of dopamine in response to it) if you force yourself to change your behavior for at least two weeks.

Meanwhile, of course, you also have to avoid your usual habits. In fact, the more radically and thoroughly you alter your behavior when creating a new pathway in the brain, the easier it is to create one

“Many boys [on university campuses] spoke openly about how they masturbated at least once every day, as if this were some sort of prudent maintenance of the psychosexual system.” … The danger is that [their addictive need for increasing stimulation] will carry over into relationships, as it did in my patients, leading to potency problems and new, at times unwelcome, tastes.

// OLD BRAINS + MODERN RELATIONSHIP STRESS = ILL HEALTH 
// effects of cortisol

The mammalian brain evaluates things as agreeable or disagreeable, and it does so very quickly, thanks to the powerful amygdala. Soothing or reassuring stimuli (receiving a massage or a gentle kiss) are associated with a neurochemical mix that includes oxytocin, while stimuli perceived as threatening (a growling dog or arguing with your mate) cause an increase in stress hormones. Information about your environment travels to both the mammalian and rational brains. However, it hits the amygdala first, because the amygdala is the shortest, quickest pathway to launch your stress response. In an emergency, you are molded to react first, think later.

Your speedy amygdala therefore acts on far less detail than your slower, rational brain receives. The amygdala gets only the headline: “Object rustling grass—left.” You jump to the right, heart racing, breath bated and pupils dilated. A split-second later your rational brain analyzes the rest of the story: “Four-legged, long-tailed lizard scurrying off. Encountered many times. Harmless.” The rational brain sends this amendment down to the amygdala, which turns off your stress response. Your agitation gradually subsides as the body disposes of circulating stress hormones.

What works great in the jungle can create problems in your love life. Stress responses are as old as animals, and roughly the same in all mammals. This means that your stress responses are ancient—shaped for the threats that animals encountered. Those stressors were chiefly physical—such as running from a predator or subduing your next meal. In most cases, events were quickly over and done with, and didn’t involve much emotional processing.

For our ancestors, the most common chronic stressor involved long periods without food, not financial worries or relationship drama. Events such as drought, long migrations, and holing up away from possible threats after critical injury, all entail physical strain, the need for mental alertness, and low food intake.

**********************************************8
When stress is chronic, adrenaline takes a backseat, and the hormone cortisol takes the wheel. Cortisol helps animals cope with extended physical or emotional stress—and affects virtually all body systems. It mobilizes energy reserves for the brain, while also turning down less essential activities, such as reproduction and digestion. It keeps an animal alert, hypervigilant, or even paranoid. This is beneficial when entering new territory or hiding from predators. Today we humans still experience high cortisol—as anxiety, insomnia, and agitation.

If a stressful situation continues, cortisol remains elevated. When threats remain, the body seems to assume that starvation is a risk. Therefore, to ensure that the brain and other vital organs are fed, higher levels of cortisol begin to break down non-essential organs and tissues to maintain blood sugar levels. Like an 
inner ghoul, cortisol starts to digest bones, muscles, and joints to obtain key nutrients to feed vital organs.

This is good for an injured deer, hiding in the bushes. After weeks without food, our recovering deer has a working brain and heart, and functional kidneys. However, its bones are thin and it has less muscle. It’s still alive, though—which it wouldn’t be without the miracle of cortisol.

Today, our biggest long-term stressors are emotional and mental, not physical. In effect, today’s humans are a new scientific experiment. The lasting threats we face typically show up as turmoil in a marriage, potential job loss, economic woes, the pressure of commuting in heavy traffic, and a barrage of fear-producing media—perhaps all in the same day. Instead of dealing at once with physical threats, we tend to anticipate threats and imagine all sorts of gruesome outcomes. (In comparison, our dog Spot maybe worries about the location of his bone.)

Even though ongoing relationship friction is not a physical threat, your body reacts like you’re an injured deer. Its automatic response is more cortisol. Cortisol can put you on hair-trigger alert, making you irritable and subject to outbursts. As time passes, changes in your brain can lead to depression or apathy. Cortisol is also very hard on your body when it stays high for a long time. In a seemingly paradoxical result, it depresses your natural immunity to disease, which can lead to innumerable disorders. It causes elevated blood fats and sugar, which are related to diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.

Like dopamine, cortisol is not “bad.” You could not get energy from food without it. And when the going gets tough, cortisol keeps you going—allowing you to accomplish more than you normally could. You may pay for it later, though, just like that deer. The damage will show up where you’re weakest, not in all your muscles and bones.

Oxytocin, and the behaviors that produce it, are your best defense against damaging, unproductive stress. In fact, research shows that oxytocin actually counteracts the effects of cortisol on the body, also reducing psychological stress.256 You feel more optimistic, relaxed, and confident. We’ll look at some interesting findings about oxytocin’s power in just a moment. First, let’s turn to your amygdala’s role in evaluating the safety of your relationship, and why you might want to soothe it consciously to protect your union.

The other night my boyfriend told me I was more effective than Ritalin at calming him down. I was like, “Score! I can’t be replaced by a pill.”

OXYTOCIN TO THE RESCUE
You have a built-in defense against alienation from your mate, although you may need to change your habits and employ lots of those mammalian bonding behaviors on this page to muster it. The key is oxytocin—nature’s antidepressant and anti-anxiety hormone. It is the basis of your relaxation response. It deactivates the stress response in the amygdala. It creates feelings of calm and a sense of connection, so it actually filters how you see the world—and even your lover. When you feel peaceful, the world looks like a better place, and your lover looks like a better person. Oxytocin also improves your health and your ability to bounce back from stress. In effect, nature rewards you for bonding—with greater well-being.

Couples in a recent experiment—who, in effect, duplicated some of the effects of bonding behaviors by sniffing oxytocin before arguing—listened better and laughed more than couples who did not. (The latter more often increased immunity and faster recovery, so soothing oxytocin (bonding behaviors) helps to heal them all. Feeling depressed? Anxious? Overactive stress response and amygdala activation are key factors in depression, and oxytocin relieves both.261 When you feel peaceful, the world looks like a better place.

Without these countermeasures, each quarrel may strengthen a defensive response, and your relationship could start to feel like a minefield of chronic stress. If stress levels rise whenever you’re together, you can perceive your mate as you would a competitor, or worse, a predator. Stressful feelings and an overheated amygdala can show up as inability to trust, self-centeredness, irritability, anxiety, decreased libido, putting one’s own needs first, depression, addiction, an us-versus-them mentality, paranoia, insomnia, and fatigue. You may feel stressed just reading that list! In any case, it’s hard to earn the “Mate of the Year” award haunted by such feelings. Yet when our mate suddenly resembles a skull-and-crossbones to our ruffled amygdala, such feelings are understandable. Been there?

Finally, as if cortisol’s effects weren’t enough, stress also decreases dopamine. Now your partner may appear quite unappealing. No wonder you find yourself looking around desperately for anything, or anyone, who will raise your dopamine—preferably someone your amygdala hasn’t yet managed to associate with subconscious fear. The good news is that a happy, oxytocin-rich amygdala keeps dopamine in the reward circuitry—making your mate look good and improving your mood.2

If you want to become less reactive and enjoy a more harmonious relationship, choose daily oxytocin-producing behaviors to shift the neurochemistry of the amygdala and turn down its volume. This tactic can also restore your bruised perception of each other. Yet oxytocin does even more.


//IS THE “BIG O” OXYTOCIN?

If you listed all the conditions and diseases related to stress, or aggravated by stress, you’d have to list nearly every known condition. Less stress means interrupted, criticized, or degraded each other.) Importantly, the cortisol levels of those who received oxytocin were lower after the conflict. Said Swiss researcher Beate Ditzen, oxytocin may explain “how close relationships—and particularly couple relationships—have a positive effect on our health.”259 You can harness your rational brain in this effort, too, by being willing to forgive a mate’s “amygdala flares” when they occur in situations that are not, in fact, threatening.

Isn’t it nice to know that you can tap the benefits of oxytocin and increase your well-being without pharmaceuticals? For example, just ten minutes of warm, supportive touching between couples who live together causes a marked increase in oxytocin in the blood.262 The more supportive those couples, the higher their blood levels of oxytocin. Massage and other supportive and caring touch lower stress hormones and blood pressure, particularly among young married men, while also releasing oxytocin.263 Want more proof of the power of bonding behaviors to supply stress relief? When facing a dreaded public-speaking gig, try hugging and watching a romantic film. It lowers blood pressure and heart rate better than resting quietly together.264 Who needs Toastmasters?

Notice that supportive touch alone makes the difference. “Talking about it” may be of limited use when a mate is anxious or irritable. Talking uses the rational brain, while holding your partner instead—preferably in silence—soothes the “problem child” itself, the amygdala. (Guys will appreciate the “in silence” part.) The time to talk will come later when perspective is restored.

Since Will and I have been using bonding behaviors more consciously in our marriage, we’ve noticed that discussions about who didn’t clean up a mess or take out the trash occur much less frequently, and even thornier discussions leave virtually no emotional wake. Best of all, we don’t have to “create space” from each other.

Speaking of good reasons to snuggle, did you know that hugs might reduce late-night attacks on tubs of ice cream? Oxytocin appears to limit consumption of both sweets265 and addictive substances. It also reduces drug withdrawal symptoms.266 Your brain knows that you’re getting the affectionate connection with others that nature intends, and it registers satisfaction. (Social animals got their oxytocin through interaction before scientists thought to pump it into their brains.) In contrast, if you isolate yourself, or take shortcuts to good feelings, such as using superstimulants, your system penalizes you with dysfunction. In the long run, it knows what’s real.

Obviously, oxytocin is likely to be behind the benefits of all affectionate intercourse because touch and intimacy produce this “cuddle chemical.” Not only that, oxytocin often surges briefly (at least in the blood) at orgasm and drops off soon thereafter. This has lead to an urban myth that we can fix our tendency to habituate to a lover simply by having more orgasms, and thereby producing more brief surges of oxytocin.

However, before you rush off to get your “relationship glue” via orgasm, you should take into account that the brief oxytocin spike at orgasm apparently signals the post-orgasmic rise in prolactin, that sexual satiation hormone we examined in Chapter Five.267 Prolactin, as you will recall, suppresses dopamine (desire and mood). You need dopamine to feel bonded, so you might want to get your oxytocin in a way that doesn’t result in lower dopamine. This oxytocin-prolactin mechanism may help explain why more orgasmic passion can actually speed habituation to a lover.

In any case, when you don’t wait out the passion cycle, and instead use hot sex to “bring back those feelings” while dopamine is suppressed, the subsequent crash can feel even worse (lower dopamine), pushing you farther apart. Evidence of this phenomenon is seen in the fragility of romantic relationships as compared with friendships—especially as the contrast between the highs and the lows becomes more apparent. It’s hard not to conclude that “something’s really wrong,” even though this deterioration is perfectly natural, and much of it would pass if lovers gave themselves time to recover while engaging in soothing, daily affection.

If you’re ready to get around the passion-cycle problem entirely, give bonding-based sex a try. It emphasizes oxytocin-producing affectionate touch without triggering subsequent feelings of “enough already.” Amazingly, oxytocin also plays a key role in both sexual receptivity in females268 and erections in males.269 In other words, oxytocin may go far in explaining why bonding-based sex is viable. It makes us feel sexy and it decreases the intensity of our cravings (sexual frustration), all at the same time.

In Love and Survival, Dean Ornish wrote, “If love and intimacy came in pill form, doctors who failed to prescribe it would be guilty of malpractice.”270 (Let’s see that advertised with its side effects!) Here’s one more sampling of what companionship and touch can do. Happily married women in a threatening situation show signs of immediate relief when holding their husband’s hand, and this has been observed in brain scans.271 As mentioned earlier, companionship also makes wounds heal faster and has been linked directly with higher oxytocin.272 Companionship increases longevity. HIV patients with a partner live longer and develop AIDS less rapidly.273 Givers of both sexes benefit, too. Providing care for your spouse for more than fourteen hours a week significantly decreases your risk of death.274 Giving also lights up the reward circuitry

My morning glucose readings were higher than most physicians would like to see.… 150s, 160s. My A1c tests have always been good, 7.0 or less. My last orgasm was July 4. During July my glucose morning readings were still in the high 140s and 150s. For the last three weeks (since entering the second phase of the Exchanges, with intercourse) I have been seeing readings in the 110 to 130 range, which is right where they should be for long-term good health. Suffice it to say I am pleased with these results for myself, and it is wonderful to experience the subtle changes in my relationship with my wife.—Calvin

As my husband and I learned more about the many gifts of oxytocin, we couldn’t help asking ourselves whether it was behind the benefits we had noticed when we experimented with karezza. Were we producing more sustained levels of oxytocin with our generous, non-driven lovemaking as we went through the Ecstatic Exchanges (at the end of this book)? Perhaps increased oxytocin was strengthening my immunity, keeping yeast and urinary tract infections at bay. Oxytocin also offered a possible explanation for Will’s ability to overcome his long-term addiction and chronic depression. Recently, scientists uncovered evidence suggesting that vasopressin, the neurochemical brother of oxytocin, which plays an additional role in pair-bonding for males, also helps inhibit alcohol use.276

Maybe there is something to that old saying “The more you give, the more you get”—at least when it comes to generous bonding behaviors.

//***************************************
NO WONDER THINGS ARE CRAZY
A related gift of our karezza experiments is that the current friction between the sexes makes sense. Not only is it comprehensible, it’s reparable. I see it with compassion, and even a touch of humor.

Of course sexual relationships are chaotic at the moment. We overcame the dangers of sexual repression, but in the process taught ourselves to use sex as a mind-altering superstimulus that makes it easy to undervalue our pair-bonds. The resulting frailty of relationships has tangled up love with fear. Love seems treacherous, and it’s natural to use and mistrust each other, berate ourselves, seek relief in isolation, or be unhappy a lot of the time. Today, humans are increasingly bold about seeking sexual stimulation, but often fearful of the enduring relationships that would best support their well-being.

Our culture’s enthusiasm for limitless orgasm is reminiscent of an infant discovering its genitals. A baby’s delight in its potential for unrestricted sexual arousal (without the interference of its rational brain) is understandable, but unrealistic. Our bodies (and brains) may simply not be designed for so much unusually potent sexual stimulation. At the same time, the media’s sexual promises, combined with the relationship stagnation that Cupid’s poison often causes, leave many of us feeling like we’re missing out on something vital if we aren’t determinedly pursuing orgasm.

Whether we’re chasing orgasms or simmering with resentment, by defining ourselves as pathological unless we’re having orgasms spontaneously and frequently, we’ve opened ourselves to manipulation by powerful pharmaceuticals that would “cure” us of our “dysfunctions” at the cost of risky side effects. For example, Viagra is still on the market despite substantial evidence that it can cause sudden, irreversible blindness.352 By 2001 it had also already been blamed for hundreds of deaths worldwide. Viagra-type drugs affect only circulation and erections, not the reward circuitry directly. Yet other drugs are already available that seek to jack up desire by tinkering with dopamine levels in the brain.353

￼
Because over the past few years, more money has been spent on breast implants and Viagra than is spent on Alzheimer’s Disease research, it is believed that by the year 2030 there will be a large number of people wandering around with huge breasts and erections … who can’t remember what to do with them.

FLEAS IN A JAR
I once read that if you put fleas in a jar and put the lid on, they will try to jump out. After they hit the lid a few times, though, they adjust the height of their jumps to a level just short of the lid. Then, when you remove the lid, they continue to restrict the height of their jumps to just short of where the lid was. In other words, they will not escape, even though they are free to go.

Our genes have successfully convinced us that we are fleas in a jar. Fertilization-driven sex causes us to bang ourselves repeatedly on the painful lid of habituation between lovers. It is no wonder we make choices as stifling as those hopeless fleas do. Maybe we withdraw from relationships altogether and substitute other stimulants, or race toward climax, compulsion, and novel partners, or settle for deadening, but less draining, relationships.

By allowing those calculating genes of ours to lead us around by our mating impulses, we have unwittingly conspired with them to create the illusion of a prison. Modern efforts to spring the trap by using sex as a superstimulus have instead made relationships even more fragile. Without our ideal mood medicine in the form of harmonious pair-bonds with trusted companions, many of us have grown unnaturally despondent and cynical. Yet by learning to preserve and strengthen our unions, we can fortify our well-being and restore our much needed enthusiasm, creativity, and caring to the world.

While we’re at it, let’s find out if there’s any truth in the Wisdom rumors of a transcendent path of relationship. Certainly loving intimacy can be a potent health enhancement and an aid to psychological well-being. Combined with karezza, it may also improve the chances of lasting harmony and ease the modern angst of “never enough.” Increased subconscious feelings of wholeness may have major implications for human contentment. What other potential does bonding-based sex offer?

Why not take the hand of a willing partner and jump as high as you can? At the very least your efforts can help you avoid the poison on Cupid’s arrow. And, who knows? There may not be a lid on the jar.


//
THE OTHER WAY OF EASING SEXUAL TENSION
Now that you understand the importance of bonding behaviors and how easy they are to use—as long as you keep giving and frequent foremost in your mind—let’s return to the question of how lovers can meet their needs for relief from sexual tension. Many people regard this challenge as more of a male issue, with good reason. On average, men produce ten to twenty times the high-octane testosterone women do. Testosterone increases dopamine, that craving neurochemical. One result is that men tend to be proceptive (willing to initiate sex) a lot of the time. Women tend to be most proceptive around ovulation, thanks to their own sex hormones.232

Whatever your gender, you probably experience sexual frustration as the strongest weapon in your genes’ arsenal. If you can’t resolve your sexual tension in a relationship, you are keenly motivated to add a lover on the side (real or two-dimensional), or move on to a relationship where you can resolve it—at least temporarily. Sadly, as we’ve seen, the harder you try to resolve your frustration through better or more frequent orgasm with any partner, the more you trigger the sexual satiety that can push mates apart. You are programmed to be unable to find lasting sexual satisfaction that way with a mate, because you have evolved to see a sex partner as less and less rewarding over time.

//
Our bodies are simply not equipped to sustain for long periods the physiological arousal associated with passionate love, desire, and other intense emotional experiences.

//
We tended to laugh a lot, to find just the right times to make love, and to enjoy hugging or touching each other at other times. Our attraction was reliable. It didn’t come and go, as it did when I ran my love life on the passion cycle. When issues came up, we were in a better place to address them, because our interior weather wasn’t as stormy.

I began to see passion and love in a new way. For as long as biology had orchestrated my love life, passion always seemed intensely real, while love appeared depressingly ephemeral. Now the situation reversed itself. I experienced love as increasingly solid and reliable. Passion, however, fluctuated in a surprisingly predictable pattern. How had I missed this for so many years?

Now that I’m in this goody-goody phase of life, in which all my pleasures are so bloody innocent, I wonder how I can ever go back to the psychodrama, the abandonment issues, the jealousy?—Ellie

In effect, your rational brain and your mammalian brain are playing a form of ping-pong—and your mammalian brain has a much stronger serve. This is because the brain pathways by which the mammalian brain communicates with the rational brain are like superhighways, while the pathways that the rational brain uses to talk to the mammalian brain are like dirt roads in the wilderness, slow and sparse.

The reptilian brain is even stronger.

// THE ROAD TO EXCESS

Our environment has dramatically changed, but our reward circuitry and mammalian brain have lagged behind. The capacity to binge on food and sex evolved when sugary foods and sexual opportunities were scarce.

￼
Now we face an array of superstimuli, which tamper with our reward circuitry, leading to withdrawal symptoms, cravings for more stimulation, and, sometimes, more permanent brain changes.

￼
Low dopamine is behind withdrawal symptoms, but it spikes when we see a cue we associate with relief. Intense cravings, and often compulsions, can result. They make the return to equilibrium very challenging.

￼
We have lost many of the rewards of close companionship that our ancestors enjoyed, which makes us more susceptible to overindulging, addictions, and compulsions.

// You eat a certain way from childhood, you already made strong neural pathways. Now to tell you to make new ones is super hard. You do not want to make a new path through tall grass, or break down you house and rebuilt it. You can say everything is fine and continue with business as usual.

The reptilian brain and mammalian brain are first to develop, your rational brain is fully developed at 25. Considering the reptilian and mammalian brain are capable of sending super strong signals, your behaviours are heavily influenced as a child. Learn wrong and it's hard later to fix your behaviour.

Story:
I saw a little girl once. She had a hamburger as big as her head. I didn't feel good when I saw her. She was with her mother. I know we are busy, busy, busy. But feeding your child fast food is bad. I felt bad when I saw her because I was thinking how she would feel in the future. Angry and frustrated she's always fat and obviously ugly. Angry because media always shows and tells her she is not thin enough bla, bla. I wondered if she would approve of the behaviour of her mother to feed her fast food. Because now she has habits, and those habits keep her fat and sick.

//************************************************************

When under the influence of post-orgasmic mood swings, we tend to see a very imperfect partner. She or he may seem high-maintenance, self-absorbed, inadequate, annoying, unable or unwilling to meet our needs, lazy, critical, boring, demanding, threatening, selfish, greedy, irrationally jealous—or all of the above. It’s hard to adore a beloved while feeling defensive or disappointed. Instead, we tend to resort to subconscious thought patterns and behaviors learned on those occasions when loved ones let us down as children. This is when romance can wither like a rose under a prism in the sun. And we never suspect that our self-generated mood changes are a big factor in our changing perceptions.

Shifts like these underscore the brutal clash between our evolutionary bonding program and our evolutionary “binge on sex until we feel compelled to add a novel mate” program. The wreckage virtually guarantees that we tangle up love and fear in our subconscious, especially with respect to intimate relationships.

Attempts to address the symptoms of this built-in separation mechanism with therapy, communication skills, negotiating skills, or artificially enhanced passion often get results, but they do not address its biological source. New rationalizations for distance arise. We humans will continue to get the same results, on average, as long as our wily genes call the shots. Those results are lots of babies and lots of broken or limping intimate relationships. We are caught in a genetically inspired dance of wanting connection—and yet wanting those things that break it up. And from our genes’ perspective, this tension is a strength, not a weakness.

We need not habituate to our partner in this way. By changing our behavior we can raise our sensitivity to our partner and continue to see him or her as rewarding. Indefinitely.

Few things can make sexual stimuli more risky and exciting (and more stirring at a neurochemical level) than a conviction that their use is “forbidden,” “sinful,” or will lead to eternal damnation. In fact, someone who is coached to believe that potent sexual stimuli are a path to the Fiery Furnace may find them even more dicey (and thrilling) than condomless anal sex. “Erotic + risky” increases both dopamine and adrenaline (fear). Adrenaline is an especially powerful memory-enhancer (neural pathway creator). A dangerous, frightening event, in effect, burns the brain. This may be why philandering church leader Ted Haggard raised his dopamine with methamphetamine use and sex with a male prostitute—when he wasn’t railing against homosexuality from the pulpit.

// this is true for food also
A third way to create hypersensitivity to sexual cues is through unusually intense sexual stimulation early in life. Young brains are especially plastic and eager to wire up sexual cues in order to enhance later reproductive success. By adulthood they have pruned back unused neural connections, making it more difficult to alter sexual proclivities. This is why adult-child sexual contact and widespread youthful use of extreme porn are both problematic.

// food also
In effect, porn sites don’t just cater to colorful tastes; they, like advertisers, create them. They also exploit users’ innate tendency to move from one novel image to the next in search of more stimulation for the brain. The brain produces more dopamine and stronger brain pathways in response to novelty.198 (Think slot machine.)

//
Our reward circuitry is a primitive, subconscious apparatus. It can’t perceive its limitations as an inner compass. It only knows how to urge us to seek pleasurable stimulation or avoid pain. Once we’re in an addictive cycle, that simplistic formula backfires. We can’t “medicate” our pain without initiating more.


********************************************************************
First Aid

One measure that can help whenever compulsion strikes is to tell yourself that you won’t act on your urge for at least five to ten minutes. Take some deep, slow breaths. Now, turn your rapt attention to a pre-selected activity. Choose something constructive, such as a breathing exercise, a stretching routine, gardening, pet training, practicing a skill, vigorous exercise, or recording thoughts in a journal. Can’t? Then simply visualize yourself engaging in such an activity, vividly picturing the details. Also imagine how it feels to exercise your will, and what it is like to have a whole team of people you admire congratulate you on your success. When you consciously redirect your attention, you make it easier to do so again in the future. You are rewiring your brain—strengthening the new pathway and weakening your former compulsion.206 Prepare your mind in advance so you are ready for recurring crises.

—Mary Sharpe, Sharpe Thinking

To the men’s relief, the once-familiar feeling of having “both feet on the ground” began to resurface. As they returned to balance and their true (calmer) libido levels, these guys were noticeably happier. At that point the occasional orgasm didn’t (usually) throw them back into compulsion—even if they did experience the effects of the passion cycle. When they made love again, they could do so in search of mutual pleasure—not simply in search of relief by the fastest route. They were actually reassured that they didn’t need all those orgasms, which had once been the center of their world.

*************************************************************
Every time porn thoughts intruded, I rapidly substituted a neutral movie of myself configuring a computer modem. I concentrated totally, actually imagining my arms touching the cables, typing into the keyboard, and so on. Within ten seconds I lost the erection and the image was gone. There was no “will power” involved. I worked with the natural processes of my brain, not against them. It always succeeded. —Takahiro

Reaching out to others and receiving encouragement helped those in recovery as much as anything else. Caring contact registered as rewarding—and therefore soothing. (We even set up a Courtly Companion program on the site to recruit anonymous pen pals for them.) They taught themselves to value contact with others above using superstimulation to shift their uncomfortable feelings. In fact, in the process of recovery, they actually became stronger, wiser, and better mates. Many found that exercise, creative projects, and meditation also helped.


//
As William Blake aptly put it, “The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom … for we never know what is enough until we know what is more than enough.” Men who voluntarily leave porn behind have been through boot camp, and if they choose to add karezza to their repertoire they will find it easily achievable. (And should they find that extensive overstimulation has left indelible brain changes,207 which make orgasmic sex a trigger for unwanted flashbacks and cravings, karezza offers an alternative for maintaining a satisfying, harmonious love life.)

Meanwhile, no one should be made to feel shame for being attracted to casual pursuit of orgasm—any more than one should feel shame about wanting sweets or petting a dog. All are predictably appealing urges, given the way our brains evolved over millions of years. Yet superstimulating versions of food and sex have the potential to become unhealthy addictions because of our primitive reward circuitry. We can easily begin to undervalue healthy foods and live companions. In short, supranormal stimulation is not necessarily harmless even when it’s arguably natural.

Using porn and engaging in risky or kinky sex are like jumping on a bike with no brakes. Maybe you can stop, maybe you can’t. One thing is certain, the longer you coach your brain to seek relief through intense sexual stimulation, the harder it will be to stop. Your brain is always in training.


// HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE A GUINEA PIG?
Oxford evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins says the content of our genome (our full DNA sequence) is information about how our ancestors survived and reproduced successfully. Past genetic success, however, is no guarantee that our preprogrammed instincts serve our well-being.

To the extent that present day conditions are different from ancestral conditions, the ancestral genetic advice will be wrong.208

Conditions are different. Our distant ancestors weren’t battered on all fronts with abnormally stimulating triggers goading them to binge on food or sex and throw their subconscious decision-making circuitry out of kilter. Sure, they liked orgasm and high-calorie treats as much as we do, but their less abundant lifestyles dictated a degree of restraint that we cannot count on to regulate our neurochemistry.

In a radio interview, Dutch scientist Gert Holstege said: “We are addicted to sex as you know, as everybody is.” He pointed out that people who are injured, so that their rational brain isn’t working right, go for orgasm all the time.209 Without our ancestral scarcity to protect us, we have very little between mammalian impulse and action except our rational brain. For decades our culture has pushed us to let our rational brains interfere with our pursuit of sexual satiety as little as possible.



// 
JACKING UP DOPAMINE this stuff works for food too
As we’ve seen, it’s possible to jack up dopamine quite unwittingly—simply by pursuing superstimulation to the point where the cues for it begin to rule us (especially when we’re feeling low). But a lot of us have help in training ourselves to become oversensitive to sexual cues. Such “help” comes in forms such as “laced” porn, teachings about the “sinfulness” of sexual stimuli, and sexual abuse as a youngster.

Guys like looking at girls, and I found it endearing when a male friend once said to me, “When I saw my first picture of a naked woman I thought, ‘this is just wonderful!’ ” However, a lot of today’s porn is different. Just as cigarette manufacturers sometimes add extra nicotine to their products to make them more addictive, so porn makers spike their products to increase their drug-like effects. They know what overstimulates the mammalian brain, and they steer right for the images that send dopamine flares skyrocketing. Today’s porn doesn’t just supply an instant harem; it supplies a harem trained to cause rapid sexual surfeit using the most shocking videos porn makers can conjure up.

This combination constitutes a stimulus that did not exist in a hunter-gatherer environment, which means we have not necessarily inherited the fortitude to resist it easily when exposed to it. And bingeing leaves us even more defenseless.

Not only does your mammalian brain increase dopamine when you come across something novel or erotic; it gives you a similar dopamine jolt for “shocking,” “painful,” and “risky.” Domination themes also arouse the mammalian brain, perhaps because of their effects on testosterone (which raises dopamine). Such images excite the brain in a way that images of cuddly affection do not. This is why so many television shows and films revolve around sex and violence.197 Such images put you in an altered state that makes you more susceptible (to advertising in the case of TV, or to compulsion in the case of porn). They induce cravings because they raise dopamine.

I’m twenty-five and started watching porn when I was eleven years old, masturbating up to five times daily. During all this time, I was easily aroused and always excited to have sex with women. Gradually, though, my porn tastes escalated to extreme fetishes. Sometimes I felt I was even forcing myself to watch it because I needed a new “kick” or “thrill” to my porn habit. I didn’t really have any problem with these new tastes until I began losing sexual interest in real women. This has destroyed my confidence and sense of identity since I always thought I would marry a woman.—Bruce

In effect, porn sites don’t just cater to colorful tastes; they, like advertisers, create them. They also exploit users’ innate tendency to move from one novel image to the next in search of more stimulation for the brain. The brain produces more dopamine and stronger brain pathways in response to novelty.198 (Think slot machine.)

There’s a second way to make images register as more outrageous (that is, make the peaks of the roller coaster higher). Paradoxically, it is well intentioned. Religious authorities often attempt to protect their followers against reckless sexual behavior with the use of guilt, shame, or moralizing. Inadvertently, they are making the challenge more difficult for many.

You can tell someone you are an alcoholic or a drug addict, and people may feel sorry for you or want to help you—but if you admit publicly to a PORN addiction, the pitchforks come out. Somehow you must be a deviant, a perv, and maybe even a sex offender or child molester! It is easier to shun, than to comfort, a porn addict.

Add to that the fact that before people can fully recover, they have to admit their addiction, that they are powerless with regard to it, and “give it up” to a higher power to pull them through. This process is accompanied by great shame, disgust, and self-loathing. “How did this happen to me? I’m normal (?). I can handle this by myself! No one can find out. I need to stop this NOW! How gross am I? How pathetic am I that I can’t just turn the computer off????” and on and on. It is just easier to give in.—Wilt

Few things can make sexual stimuli more risky and exciting (and more stirring at a neurochemical level) than a conviction that their use is “forbidden,” “sinful,” or will lead to eternal damnation. In fact, someone who is coached to believe that potent sexual stimuli are a path to the Fiery Furnace may find them even more dicey (and thrilling) than condomless anal sex. “Erotic + risky” increases both dopamine and adrenaline (fear). Adrenaline is an especially powerful memory-enhancer (neural pathway creator). A dangerous, frightening event, in effect, burns the brain. This may be why philandering church leader Ted Haggard raised his dopamine with methamphetamine use and sex with a male prostitute—when he wasn’t railing against homosexuality from the pulpit.

Folks who want to stay on the straight-and-narrow can do so a lot more easily if they understand how supranormal stimulation can pull their strings, and which activities do a better job of promoting lasting good feelings (more on those in the next two chapters). Meanwhile, if one chooses to step off of the roller coaster onto solid ground, it is more effective to view an unwelcome habit as a soon-to-fade brain pathway than as a “sin,” and set about retraining the brain.

A third way to create hypersensitivity to sexual cues is through unusually intense sexual stimulation early in life. Young brains are especially plastic and eager to wire up sexual cues in order to enhance later reproductive success. By adulthood they have pruned back unused neural connections, making it more difficult to alter sexual proclivities. This is why adult-child sexual contact and widespread youthful use of extreme porn are both problematic.199


***********************************
As we have seen, mammals are programmed to mate like mad as dopamine surges—and then, when it drops, go about other activities until their libido recovers naturally. However, males are equipped to override this natural cycle automatically under a single set of circumstances: exposure to a novel mate.158 Dangle a receptive female before a sexually satiated male rat, and he will valiantly rise to the occasion. (Female mammals also appear to perk up around new sperm donors.) This is the Coolidge effect, but you may want to think of it as “the Sooty effect”:

Romeo Guinea Pig Causes Baby Boom:

A guinea pig called Sooty enjoyed a night of passion with twenty-four females after fooling his way into their cage in south Wales. Sooty wooed the lady guinea pigs, one by one, and has now become the proud father of forty-two baby guinea pigs.…“He was absolutely shattered. We put him back in his cage and he slept for two days.”159

Think some vestige of this program is still encoded in human brains? What about polyamorous hunter-gatherer men and women, sultans with harems, porn users in search of the next novel image, and today’s revolving-door marriages?

Where is this program pushing us these days? Not only where our genes want us to go—exploitation of the occasional chance to fertilize multiple mates—but often beyond, into empty compulsion. And all because times have changed.

The mammalian brain is designed to capitalize on short-term opportunities. This is why we have the dubious ability to gorge when presented with high-calorie food—and store it as spare tires and thunder thighs. In the days before refrigerators and reliable food supplies, it made sense to binge and convert surplus food to a bit of extra fat for easy transport.

Similarly, if, like Sooty, you find yourself in a cloister of lonely hearts, you could (theoretically, of course) amaze yourself with your prowess. Or, if female, your ability to gather competing sperm. Think mating season.

Speaking of getting it while you can, both the fat-storage and sexual satiation-override programs evolved when high-calorie food and novel potential mates were Big Events, not daily occurrences. Our ancestors’ reward circuits lit up brightly and our genetic programs are the result. One reason that intense “go for it!” signals once worked in humanity’s favor in the case of high-calorie food and sexual opportunity is that our stark environments also regulated us.

Chantek is a smart, lovable orangutan who lives at the Atlanta zoo. Trained in sign language, he has a vocabulary of more than 150 words, and he is considered a decent artist.…
Growing up in this human setting, Chantek became REALLY FAT, weighing in at five hundred pounds, roughly three times his ideal size. Afraid that the massive bulk would collapse his lungs, scientists placed him on a strict diet. Formerly five hundred pounds of fun, he became four hundred pounds of anger. During the diet, his favorite sign language symbol became “candy.” He refused to draw and instead ate the crayons given for his artistic use.

While on his diet, Chantek even pulled off an escape.… He was eventually found sitting next to the up-ended food barrel, using all four limbs to stuff monkey chow into his mouth.

Chantek is unique, not only for his human contact and his linguistic and artistic abilities but also for his weight. You see, there are no fat orangutans outside zoos and research centers. Wild orangutans, despite sharing Chantek’s genetic zest for a fine meal, maintain a svelte 160 pounds or so because food is relatively scarce and difficult to obtain in the jungles of Borneo.160

******************************
As Terry Burnham and Jay Phelan explain in Mean Genes: From Sex to Money to Food, Taming Our Primal Instincts, our environment has changed, leaving our reward circuitry very vulnerable. Like Chantek, we are molded to meet conditions that prevailed during our brain’s millions of years of development. Honey and ripe fruit were rare sources of concentrated sugar, and cave girls were no doubt cute, but their erotically posed images weren’t airbrushed to perfection and projected over every visible surface. There was less opportunity for hooking up with exciting new mates you barely knew. No singles bars, no tantra weekends, and no schools with hundreds of cute strangers of the opposite sex.

Here’s the danger in our modern circumstances: When a mammal’s brain hasn’t adapted to the intensity and quantity of a stimulus, that stimulus registers as a superstimulus. The examples at the end of the preceding paragraph can be superstimuli for our hunter-gatherer brains. Internet porn is an extreme superstimulus. It’s on tap twenty-four/seven, free of social constraints, always novel, and ever kinkier.

Exposure to supranormal, i.e., above-normal, stimulation evokes especially powerful “This is great; pay attention!” signals in the brain, thanks to surging dopamine. Next, brain changes urge us to override our satiety mechanisms, so, like Sooty the guinea pig, we don’t miss an apparent golden opportunity. Alas, a potent “Focus on this!” command doesn’t guarantee that the activity or substance is actually worthy of our exaggerated attention (and our consequent inattention to other things or people in our life).

“WHERE’S MY TRIBE?”
The more intense the stimulation, the greater the subsequent discomfort. Most of us learn this fairly early by drinking too much alcohol. So why do we keep reaching for empty temptations that leave hangovers? Usually because we aren’t getting enough of the other rewards our brain finds gratifying. Let’s look at what we’re missing.

While we can’t know exactly what our hunter-gatherer ancestors’ daily lives looked like, we have some idea based on anthropologists’ accounts. Typically, we would have spent our lives among one, or two, relatively small groups of people whom we knew well. Although courtship and sex would have been two of life’s most intense pleasures, we would also have enjoyed other rewarding activities: the thrill and satisfaction of a successful hunt, eating simple foods with no refined sugar, interacting with others through ceremonies and daily tasks, and, of course, bonding with our parents, offspring, and extended family. As children we would have received on-the-job training (and teasing) from our friends and relatives.

There was also probably a good bit of leisure time. For example, Africa’s Bushmen hunt and gather for only a few hours a day. They spend the rest of their time hanging out socializing.162 As we will see in later chapters, social interaction with those we trust is one of the best forms of health insurance.

Contrast that lifestyle—the one for which our brain is well equipped—with today’s. At every turn we are confronted with intense stimulation. There are millions of diverse Web sites, thousands of stores, and hundreds of TV channels clamoring for our attention. We’re constantly tempted with empty-calorie, high-sugar snacks, risk-taking opportunities, high-action video games, sexually stimulating images, and, often, opportunities to hook up for orgasms without emotional ties. All promise exciting dopamine surges, which means that many of us suffer withdrawal symptoms, mild or severe, a lot of the time.

Is it any wonder that porn use is growing exponentially? Or that obesity in the U.S. has increased to the point that, for the first time, our life span is predicted to be shorter than that of our parents?

Sexual stimulation for its own sake sounds good, and the urge to grab it when it’s offered is certainly natural. But one reason it’s so enticing these days is that many of life’s other rewarding pleasures are hard to come by. Those age-old rewards of playing, working, learning, and facing challenges with lifelong companions are both comforting and healthful.

In contrast, today’s parents often have little time for social rewards. Mothers return to work soon after a child arrives. Many do not live near extended families, so kids are separated from their clans and placed in daycare, then school, with strangers. There they face the stress of sitting all day, testing, worrying about grades, bullies, cliques, social rejection, and even violence—all without their natural companions or lifestyle. For example, recent research suggests that ADHD is not a pathological condition—for a hunter-gatherer. He needs to be impulsive, energetic, and easily bored.163

As adults we’re glued to computers in cubicles or factory slots, and seldom have the satisfaction of working face-to-face to meet common challenges. Ceremonies may be few, and there is often little time for chewing the fat with friends or helping each other with life’s trials. Tasks that would once have registered as enjoyable, such as preparing our children for adulthood, now register as exhausting. At the same time, our inherent tendency to find novel mates compelling is resurging—due to greater opportunity and, often, shorter, less comforting relationships.

How well suited are we to this lifestyle of lots of stress countered by so little reliable affectionate interaction? Our mammalian brain is designed to seek what is pleasurable and avoid what is (harmfully) stressful. What pleasures can it find today? Not many of the once familiar, life-enhancing, comforting connections with others. Instead, we often believe we have to seek pleasure among the more selfish, often solitary, thrills of high-calorie snacks, shopping, pursuit of orgasm, and chances to win money. Also, companionship must be cultivated, while many solitary indulgences seem to offer easy pleasure—until we overdo them, and want off of the roller coaster.

Q: How did Pinocchio discover he was made of wood?

A: His hand caught fire.

No wonder many of us grab for available pleasures with such determination. But there is a hidden risk. Research suggests that the absence of friendly interaction makes us more susceptible to addiction.164 In this chapter, we’ll look at this phenomenon from various angles.

THE AGONY OF EXCESS
Imagine a “stimulation gauge” that looks something like a tachometer (the instrument in your car that registers revolutions per minute, or RPMs). After dopamine surges into the “red zone” during intense stimulation, receptors for it drop even lower than normal. Dopamine sensitivity can then fluctuate for a while during the return to homeostasis—as your tachometer does when you shift through the gears.

Every deep dip can leave you aching for relief—and ready to pounce on any promising activity or substance. When is your mouth most likely to water in response to the smell of something appetizing? After a big meal? No, your gauge won’t budge. If someone offers you more, you’re likely to say to yourself, “no way!” But what about when you work late, skip dinner, and smell a grilling burger? Your body lets you know (with surges of dopamine) that you need to make eating a top priority.165

The more uncomfortable you are, the more urgently your mammalian brain scans for something to relieve your misery. When it lights on a cue it associates with relief, it sends your dopamine needle into the red zone of your inner gauge. You experience an intense craving. A candy bar may look so vital to your reward circuitry that your rational brain will temporarily ignore your expanding waistline. This mechanism worked fine for your distant ancestors. All their options for relief were reasonably healthy ones, and their frugal environments made bingeing a rare occurrence.

In contrast, our lifestyle doesn’t protect us from overindulgence. Too much stimulation, followed by frequent lows, means we are riddled with unusually intense cravings for relief. Superstimuli keep us out of balance, making us better consumers, but less satisfied overall. Our recurring, urgent sense of lack heavily influences the choices we make—without our conscious awareness.

SACCHARIN AND THE SHAKES
Consider the following experiment. Researchers withheld food from rats for twelve hours and then gave them nutritionally balanced food, plus a heavy dose of sugar (glucose) water. This created a cycle of bingeing. When researchers cut off the sugar water after only ten days, the rats showed signs common to drug withdrawal, such as anxiety, chattering teeth, and tremors, as well as craving and relapse (evidence of long-lasting effects in their brains)166

Scientists then measured the rats’ dopamine levels. They found that the levels were “qualitatively similar to withdrawal from morphine or nicotine,” which suggests that the rats were indeed addicted to sugar.167

What does this tell us? That we are really mean to little white rats. But it also tells us that mammals can become addicted, and suffer withdrawal (hangovers), from natural substances and experiences—if they indulge in a way that throws their dopamine levels out of kilter. Unlike alcohol or nicotine, glucose (sugar) is not a drug. The body automatically keeps blood glucose within rather narrow ranges no matter how much sugar you eat, or don’t eat. In other words, a “sugar high” (and low) comes from activation of your reward circuitry when you taste (or later crave) something intensely sweet. It doesn’t come directly from the sugar itself going into your blood and acting on your brain.

Glucose itself can’t create a long-tailed glucose junkie; dopamine highs and lows can. Intense stimulation (sweetness) is the key factor. We know this because scientists repeated the same experiment using the artificial sweetener saccharin, and guess what? They ended up with rat saccharin addicts (yuck).168 It is the superstimulation of excess that sets up the potential for addiction by dysregulating the reward circuitry. In the case of saccharin, a fake substance with no nutritional value, the intake of which does not increase our chances of survival, fools the reward circuitry—leading to addiction and withdrawal misery. Obviously the mammalian brain associates sweet with “ripe.” It never had to contend with saccharin. Eventually the body figures out that saccharin isn’t as satisfying as sugar, which is why you may reach for even more food than usual if you use artificial sweeteners.169 But the cycle that can lead to withdrawal symptoms is triggered by sweetness, not sugar.

Let’s see. How else can our reward circuitry become highly activated by a natural reinforcer without any payoff for us or our genes?

A new study found that male monkeys will give up their juice rewards in order to ogle pictures of female monkeys’ bottoms. The way the experiment was set up, the act is akin to paying for the images, the researchers say.170

Pornography!* And which is strongest: the urge to eat ripe fruit, or the urge to fertilize a novel mate? Blast your built-in sexual eagerness with images, videos, and activities that you find intensely arousing, and you can slip into a sexual binge. Porn is as empty as saccharin, in that there’s no real value, no one to impregnate, and no rewarding, comforting interaction with another human being.

A lot of addiction is the result of experience … repetitive, high-emotion, high-frequency experience.

//************************************************************************************
PORN’S SURPRISING LESSON
Mere orgasm can set off a cycle of discomfort, so it shouldn’t be a surprise that bingeing on porn, a limitless supranormal stimulus, can create intense withdrawal symptoms. Yet I learned this by accident. I was all for freedom of speech, and a staunch member of the “to each his own taste” club. However, I had created a Web site that discusses the highs and lows of sexual satiety in terms of the highs and lows of the typical addiction cycle and the parallel wisdom found in historical texts.

To my surprise (and theirs, I’m sure), men from all over the world showed up in my Web site’s forum complaining of addiction to porn/masturbation, and seeking to regain their free will. They were stuck on a dopamine elevator going between penthouse and basement, without ever being able to explore the floors in between. It seemed that information about how orgasm can become compulsive was so scarce that even a site grounded in ancient wisdom about managing sex was filling a void. (Gee thanks, Google!)

At first it was painful reading their stories. These guys were constantly overheated—due to the many virtual mates that their mammalian brains perceived as genetic opportunities. Unlike Sooty, however, they could never rest. Their fertilization duties were never done. There was always another enticing image just a click away, and their mammalian brains were determined to leave no picture unfertilized. Their issue wasn’t shame; it was addiction. When they tried to unhook themselves, they faced intense withdrawal symptoms that fluctuated in intensity for weeks:

First guy: Today the whole day I have been shaking with jitters similar to how it felt when I quit smoking. My body has been jolted with what felt like unusually intense energy, especially in my spine. I feel tense and stiff for a while and then as if my spinal bones are being popped and a big relief and then tension and then relief. It just came out of the blue and has been subsiding.

Second guy: Here are the withdrawal symptoms I have experienced: intense bouts of anger leading to interpersonal difficulties, aggressive demeanor, easily stressed out (I’m inexperienced confronting the real world without that soup of post-orgasmic chemicals sedating me), suicidal ideation, severe depression, violent dreams while sleeping (I actually enjoyed these, however others might consider them nightmares), insomnia, hallucinations (jumped out of bed screaming because I felt a “presence”), felt like insects were crawling all over me when going to bed, shakes, mania (energy far in excess of my ability to use it constructively), and inability to concentrate.

Third guy: Bored? Masturbation. Angry? Masturbation. Sad? Masturbation. Stressed? Masturbation. I went from being the first of my class to the very bottom, until I dropped out for good. I ended up working on the Web, making good money and having my porn one click away. This was my life, and I didn’t recognize I had an addiction until I had surgery and masturbation was out of the question for fifteen days. On day three, I was literally shaking, and I began to connect the dots. My other symptoms are: irritability, inability to focus (“staring at walls syndrome”), mood swings, headaches (sometimes quite strong), sense of pressure in my genitals, pictures of movies/starlets popping out in my mind, paranoia, self-defeating thinking, depression, sense of hopelessness (“I lost so many years of my life”. One example: I painstakingly created 250 DVDs with twenty to thirty porn scenes each, meticulously cataloged … and now destroyed.), and fear that I will never be able to have sex because I have not learned any social skills since I delved into porn eight years ago as a teen.

My husband, Will, and I thought we were the only ones making the connection between experiences like these and the addiction cycle of high-low dopamine. Then we found the words of Princeton’s longtime reward-circuitry researcher, the late Bartley Hoebel:

Highly potent sexual stimuli [and junk food] are the only stimuli capable of activating the dopamine system with anywhere near the potency of addictive drugs.

// oxytocin to the rescue, bonding
From our genes’ perspective, bonding is all well and good—to a degree. In our species, bonds contribute to our genes’ goal of getting more of themselves into the future, because children with two caregivers have a greater chance of surviving to reproduce.

Yet even if we often fall in love before we have sex, bonds are secondary in our sexual relationships. Those bonds need only last long enough (on average) for caregivers to bond with their offspring. In our genes’ view, bonds must not interfere with the genetic goal of encouraging infidelity. Evolution’s solution? Our mammalian mating program leads to recurring sexual satiety. As we habituate to a lover, we view him or her as less rewarding (less dopamine). Over time, weakening emotional bonds free us to fool around (or simply fuel unnecessary resentment and discouragement).

We are programmed for this tension. Parents who stay in love are best for children. If lasting love were also best for our genes, we’d be great at it already. (And if promiscuity were best for our genes, we’d be as promiscuous as bonobo chimps.) Instead, we’re programmed for a tug-of-war between mating and bonding. Even so, once we know how to regulate both programs, we can steer for harmony over habit.

Our capacity for emotional bonding with our mates, friends, and pets arises from the same mechanism in the brain that allows infants to bond to caregivers. Reptiles generally just lay eggs and wander off; baby mammals need strong emotional ties to survive. Evolution works with what it has, modifying existing mechanisms to perform slightly different functions. Bonding between mates (pair-bonding) is known as an exaptation because it uses a mechanism that originally evolved for another purpose (infant-caregiver bonding), and expands it a bit.

Yet this evolutionary stepchild can serve as the basis for harmonious, lasting union if we choose to use it for this purpose. How do we know this? One clue is that parents can continue to love their own children,219 even if they end up as murderers. In other words, we have the means to find another person rewarding indefinitely—if we activate this bonding mechanism, keep it activated, and combine it with lovemaking that soothes our “mating” hunger without causing sexual satiety.

Our mammalian bonding program does not operate on words or logic; it runs on a mutual exchange of specific behaviors. Yet it can only succeed—even between infants and caregivers—when both parties activate and sustain it using those behaviors (also called cues).220

This means that you can maintain and deepen your emotional bond with your mate by continuing to exchange the right signals. Typical bonding cues would be eye contact, hugs, and skin-to-skin contact. A more complete list is provided below. As recounted in Chapter Three, my husband and I worked some of this out by accident. We noticed that when we drifted too far into self-centered, hungry touch, we needed to stop and tune up with a few nights of conscious, generous affection. Without realizing it, we were signaling our mammalian brains to renew our bond. After only a few days, we looked adorable to each other again (except during low points in inadvertent passion cycles). Now we exchange these cues daily, even if only for a moment or two.


// bonds make you stronger
According to the late Ashley Montagu, author of Touching: The Human Significance of the Skin, we adults tend to drift toward using these cues exclusively to pursue tension release in the form of orgasm. Yet, if we used them more consciously as tender acts of communication, they could relieve stress more effectively. (More on why in the next chapters.) Montagu cites research in which rats that had been handled frequently and gently could withstand stressors that rapidly proved fatal to ungentled rats. The handled rats were also strikingly calm and friendly, unlike their wild cousins.224 Selfless touch is a powerful source of inner peace and well-being, so go on, handle your rat!


// THE LOOPHOLE IN OUR GENES’ PLAN
One reason that we all enjoy the idea of connecting with a mate (apart from all that racy honeymoon neurochemistry) is that it feels good to bond deeply with another person. Our pair-bonding mechanism (like our mating program) has the power to light up our reward circuitry.227 (Those dopamine urges to eat food, drink water, and connect with others are all necessary for survival.) In fact, one reason addicts become addicts is that they are seeking the neurochemical rewards that they have not found through comforting emotional bonds.228 This is a key point, to which we will return.

Remember those smiles of delight, kisses and hugs, and lingering gazes of your earliest romance? Sweethearts, like parents and infants, instinctively exchange subconscious bonding cues. These exchanges feel so good that we would continue to engage in them—if it weren’t for the aftereffects of too much stimulation. Orgasm can flatten our neurochemical sensitivity and distort perception for approximately two weeks. In some of us it makes any activity, including affection, seem pointless, unless it is geared toward intense stimulation. This cheats both partners, because non-goal-oriented bonding behaviors are perhaps the most efficient way to restore balance, and therefore sensitivity to life’s subtler pleasures.

Meanwhile, if you just trust your instincts while experiencing the subconscious effects of the passion cycle, you may believe you have fallen out of love—or are justified in meeting your heightened cravings for intense stimulation elsewhere. The prospect of an affair can feel like neurochemical medicine when you have allowed your mating program to dampen your responsiveness to your mate. You may be hypersensitive to any hot prospect who seems to promise to restore your “aliveness.”


//*******************************************
Any of us can harness this bonding mechanism at any age—not just to make our relationships more sane and loving, but also to improve our confidence, resilience, and empathy. Consider the experience of Daniel Solomon, a thirteen-year-old suffering from reactive attachment disorder (impulsive rage resulting from absence of early parental bonding).

An orphan, Daniel spent seven years in a shared crib in a Romanian orphanage. His adoptive parents tolerated years of his random, explosive anger, physical violence, and the creation of more than a thousand holes in his bedroom walls. In desperation, they at last experimented with bonding cues. They held Daniel’s adult-sized body for twenty minutes a day, in their laps, on the couch, while looking into his eyes, feeding him ice cream, and listening to what he had to say.

He resisted the process at the beginning (hence the ice cream bribes). Yet after three weeks his behavior improved, and he finally began to register that his parents loved him. A secure bond with them freed him to develop normally elsewhere in his life. He began making friends his own age, and even received an award from the temple that had previously banned him for his intolerable behavior. His acceptance speech, in which he thanked his parents for their determination to connect with him, exemplifies the power of bonding cues in action.226

Even the healthiest relationships depend on lovers continuing to find each other rewarding at a subconscious level. If you want to outsmart your conniving genes and keep the sparkle in your relationship: (1) learn to relieve your sexual tension without resorting to orgasm to the extent possible (more on that in a moment), and (2) exchange bonding cues with each other often. These are the two pedals that allow you to drive around your genes’ deep-seated relationship roadblocks.

I would recommend keeping a daily mood journal. It can give you a clear picture of how well this works. My partner and I started down this path about 18 months ago. I was sure the hangover wouldn't be real for me, but I learned I'm definitely critical and more emotionally unstable after orgasm. I also feel more alone and misunderstood, and ready to blame my partner for any slight. Recently, someone commented about how happy we seem all the time, now. Always smiling and laughing together. And it's true. I can't remember the last time we had an argument.—Carrie

//
BALANCE FIRST
The effects of karezza show up first as a return to balance. If you haven’t felt a sense of equilibrium in a while, you may find it odd. For example, a girlfriend once tried gentle intercourse without orgasm with her busy executive sweetheart during a weekend away. Initially, it caused him to sleep far more than usual. He felt great at the end of the weekend. Yet he clearly found his uncharacteristic behavior disturbing. In fact, he asked if she had given him a sleeping pill!

In contrast, those who are feeling sluggish begin to shift toward a renewed zest for life. A friend in England who experimented with bonding behaviors found that she soon enthusiastically initiated sex with her husband, which he relished. For years she had grimly endured intercourse, which she found painful, just to hold her marriage together. “And,” she confided in her colorful Cockney accent, “ ’E loved ’is foot massage. In twenty-five years of marriage oi’d never even seen ’is feet!”

Moving toward karezza during the passion cycle (after orgasm) can be a bit like watching paint dry at first—albeit with the added benefits of a companion and an increasing sense of well-being. This was especially true when I was pumped up on honeymoon neurochemicals and feeling passionate. Incidentally, at first I thought it was karezza’s job to keep the neurochemical illusion of the honeymoon going indefinitely. It’s not. Honeymoon neurochemistry is like a feeding frenzy—exciting, exhausting, and intended for maximizing genetic success.

The mind-altering buzz of new love is not sustainable without continual artificial life support. When we rely primarily on dopamine for our thrills, more and more stimulation (or a longer interval between trysts) is generally needed to attain the same orgasmic intensity. After a while, mastering additional G-spot geography or seeking novelty by having sex on the kitchen table or tying each other up can feel like work. It becomes far more efficient to add a novel partner, with whom passion will be effortless—for a while.

Karezza let me off of the carousel, but it took some getting used to. It didn’t squelch the honeymoon effect, but it shifted it from “edgy” to “lighthearted.” In fact, karezza was sweet sanity by comparison.

￼
Our bodies are simply not equipped to sustain for long periods the physiological arousal associated with passionate love, desire, and other intense emotional experiences.

—Pamela C. Regan, psychologist

Initially, I wondered if I would be attracted to my partner without that exciting “love sickness” I was hooked on. I was relieved to realize that our mutual magnetism remained. There just wasn’t a desperate, “rip your clothes off” quality to our attraction. With or without clothes, it felt more like two dolphins frolicking. We tended to laugh a lot, to find just the right times to make love, and to enjoy hugging or touching each other at other times. Our attraction was reliable. It didn’t come and go, as it did when I ran my love life on the passion cycle. When issues came up, we were in a better place to address them, because our interior weather wasn’t as stormy.

I began to see passion and love in a new way. For as long as biology had orchestrated my love life, passion always seemed intensely real, while love appeared depressingly ephemeral. Now the situation reversed itself. I experienced love as increasingly solid and reliable. Passion, however, fluctuated in a surprisingly predictable pattern. How had I missed this for so many years?

Now that I’m in this goody-goody phase of life, in which all my pleasures are so bloody innocent, I wonder how I can ever go back to the psychodrama, the abandonment issues, the jealousy?—Ellie

RELAXATION VERSUS PERFORMANCE
It is probably clear by now that karezza depends on the rewarding feelings that come from relaxed mutual adoration and generous touch (bonding behaviors). As we’ll see in the next chapter, karezza seems to be associated with a neurochemical cocktail that’s a lot heavier on the “cuddle chemical” (oxytocin) than on passionate surges of dopamine. Karezza definitely does not rely on the rewards that come from approaching one’s own orgasm or inducing it in a lover. This makes it radically different from most tantric or sex magick approaches, in which partners work hard at revving each other up to achieve mind-altering intensity.

The Taoists distinguish the two fundamental approaches to sex as “valley orgasm” and “peak orgasm,” but that terminology confused me mightily. In my mind, “orgasm” sounded like a clear goal, something to strive for, an unmistakable line to cross. Since I wasn’t experiencing a tension-release response resembling a conventional orgasm with karezza, I first assumed I was doing it wrong. I also imagined that the valley orgasm must lie somewhere near the peak orgasm. It doesn’t. You flow into the valley when you’re feeling relaxed, safe, and loving. As soon as you engage in effort, you have your hiking boots on, and you’re headed for the peaks again. Striving is counterproductive.

I understood the distinction better once Will explained that the human nervous system isn’t meant to strive and relax at the same time.

Karezza apparently activates the body’s relaxation response more than orgasmic sex does. Perhaps you learned in school that your nervous system has two fundamental responses to stimuli: parasympathetic and sympathetic. Comforting stimuli activate the parasympathetic nerves, allowing your system to focus on regeneration, digestion, healing, sexual arousal, and general housekeeping.233 Karezza, with its emphasis on relaxed, non-goal-oriented affection, seems to rely heavily on activating these nerves.

Although sexual arousal is a parasympathetic (relaxation) activity, the actual drive to orgasm invokes your body’s sympathetic nerves (the ones that enable the fight-or-flight response). Hot sex is an athletic exercise. Your heart rate increases; you perspire. It’s like any other goal-directed activity, particularly when your survival is at stake. Indeed, biologically driven sex is exactly that. You are in performance mode, doing what needs to be done to survive (through passing on your genes).

The body “reads” bonding behaviors as signals for feeling safe and getting closer. It may be that it does not “read” performance-oriented lovemaking as a bonding signal, but rather as something more akin to a fight-or-flight activity. This powerful drive may produce orgasms, but not profound feelings of safety or a desire to remain close. This could explain why certain types of sacred sex practices, which call for vigorous lovemaking, do so little to bond partners over the long term.

Paradoxically, the more exhausting your daily demands, the more appealing hot sex can seem. It fires up the exciting fight-or-flight response, making you feel alive and vital, and then it provides the temporary stress release of a sudden drop in dopamine. It’s a coping mechanism, but it means you relax through using each other in a way that can cause subsequent feelings of depletion and apathy toward your partner. In contrast, karezza is fulfilling and reassuring because you both continue to feel energized enough to nurture each other attentively.

With karezza, you ideally stay away from the edge of orgasm. However, if you sense yourself slipping into performance mode while making love, you can pull yourself back into parasympathetic with deeper, longer breaths. The buildup to orgasm coincides with an increase in muscular tension and an urge to restrict your breathing. Therefore, if you want to switch over to your relaxation response, rest your abdominal muscles and slow your breathing. Shift your attention to nurturing your partner.

The ultimate goal of karezza is to remain in relaxation mode, yet fall into a heightened state of dynamic stillness. It’s not a tense state of hyper-alertness, but more like the “flow” that artists and athletes report. The unfamiliar emphasis on relaxation may be why karezza feels so foreign at first.

One benefit is that there is absolutely no performance anxiety—unless you create it for yourself (as I did) by imagining that there should be a simple cause and effect, leading to a predictable, repeatable result.

As I learned more about my neurochemistry, I also realized that “striving” equates with “craving,” which entails high dopamine—and self-serving behavior. Slow learner though I was, I finally grasped that I would never experience karezza’s full potential while striving for any kind of experience.

I personally don’t think that there is any sexual tension in what you call bonding-based sex. If there is, then it is fertilization-driven sex. I think of sexual tension as passion, desire, fire, horniness—like a volcano that can only ease itself with a flow of lava (climax or orgasm). Bonding-based sex is connection on a deep level. It’s union with each other in harmony with the goal of becoming one. There’s no sexual frustration, just a subtle, powerful sexual energy.—Katrina


// Habituation
If you eat the same food over and over you won't get enough dopamine, you will rate it lower and lower. You want diversity, it's baked into you.

**********************************************************
// WARDING OFF THE HABITUATION BLUES
With oxytocin’s bonding properties in mind, let’s return briefly to the passion cycle discussed in Chapter Five. Both oxytocin and dopamine—at ideal levels—are necessary to keep an emotional bond rewarding. When researchers blocked either dopamine or oxytocin in the reward circuitry of monogamous voles (and rodent mothers), the same thing happened—or, rather, didn’t happen. Prairie voles remained footloose and fancy-free, and moms didn’t bond with their pups.
I have absolutely noticed his post-orgasmic behavior changes: drained sense of being, food and tobacco cravings, etc. In the first few days after our reunion the connection was so beautiful. Now, three weeks down the track, when I ask if he would like to breathe into the heart to connect more deeply, he says “yes,” but shuts his eyes (says he’s tired) and I can’t feel him at all.—Mira

Ever notice that the first slice of pizza is much better than the fourth? You produce less dopamine in response to that last slice. Same thing with the mate with whom you’ve repeatedly sexually satiated yourself. You can’t feel gushy while experiencing low dopamine in response to someone’s presence. Neurochemically, it’s out of the question.

Ideal levels of oxytocin and dopamine may also make mates more tolerant and likelier to accommodate each other. Certainly during the honeymoon period, things that normally bother people, don’t, and lovers find it harder to be unhappy.254 By avoiding habituation, my husband and I continue to experience uncharacteristically high levels of tolerance and contentment. We suspect both (balanced) dopamine and oxytocin are at work.

Stronger bonds, increased flexibility, and greater happiness are good reasons to master lovemaking that leaves you contented—but not finished (sated). Think of karezza as the equivalent of having two or three slices of pizza. Afterward you’re not hungry, but you’re also not stuffed. In fact, by emphasizing the bonding behaviors in the last chapter, you can continue to find each other delicious, which may lead to a bit of nibbling. And you sidestep the dangers of your built-in “too much pizza” program.

As J. William Lloyd once wrote:

It is the wine of sex that gives love its enchantment and divine dreams. This is easily proven by giving lovers unrestricted license to express their transports. No sooner have they wasted the wine of sex by reckless embraces—often a single orgasm will thus temporarily demagnetize the man—though they love each other just the same, as they will each stoutly 
Now, suppose, like most folks, you and your lover engage in frequent orgasm. This makes the ideal balance of oxytocin and dopamine tough to maintain, especially in relation to each other. Dopamine temporarily fluctuates (or sensitivity to it changes) during each passion cycle. If you’ve exceeded your allotment of “honeymoon uppers” (that extra helping of temporary new-relationship “obsession” neurochemicals), your relationship is likely to suffer when dopamine levels bounce around. Engaging in sex will probably bring initial relief, but also push you farther toward habituation to your partner. You may begin to feel irritable, resentful, needy, or fatigued. Even if you feel none of these things, you may notice yourself engaging in annoying (separating) behaviors—or find that your partner has mysteriously become insufferable.

Think of oxytocin and dopamine as the yin and yang of bonding and love. There’s even evidence that these two neurochemicals stimulate each other’s release, so if one is low, it affects levels of the other.252 This means that the neurochemical changes after orgasm, which cause dopamine levels to fluctuate for a while, may well interfere with our oxytocin-based feelings of love. Ouch.

Whatever the combination of mechanisms, habituation is a definite risk. A mate (unlike a potential novel partner) can start to look like a movie we’ve seen too often, or a food we’ve eaten too much, or one of those really annoying “Top 40s” hits—even though we still like movies, food, and music.

Although you and your beloved enjoyed a strong emotional bond in the past, you may not find your interactions very juicy while your dopamine is low. Your honey, who registered a “9” on your brain’s dopamine scale before all that hanky-panky, is now sometimes registering a mere “4.” A “9” was worth the effort of generous affection. A “4?” Not so much. You may feel less like snuggling each other using those oxytocin-producing bonding cues listed in the last chapter. You may even morph from a doting prairie vole into a disinterested montane vole. It could seem like you and your partner have different levels of commitment to the relationship.

And all this misery is normal. A similar neurochemical phenomenon occurs with regard to food. Both animals and humans will turn to a new food rather than eat one that they’ve already gorged on. That’s why you can still eat an ice cream sundae even when you can’t face another helping of grandma’s famous stroganoff.253 Just as our genes want variety in our diets, they want variety in our sex lives.

I have absolutely noticed his post-orgasmic behavior changes: drained sense of being, food and tobacco cravings, etc. In the first few days after our reunion the connection was so beautiful.

TREASURE YOUR PARTNER, ENCOURAGE YOUR FRIENDS, BE SLOW TO JUDGE
As you can see from the above material, whether your partner is prepared to try karezza or not, your presence in each other’s lives is a health-giving, mood-medicating benefit. When possible, show your appreciation with bonding behaviors from Chapter Seven.

If you have single friends, comfort them with more social interaction. Introduce them to prospective mates without worrying about what may go wrong. If something goes wrong, it’s to be expected. After all, our scheming genes win most hands in the mating game. At least you improve your friends’ chances of finding nurturing companionship.

If you don’t yet have a partner, you can still enrich your life and the lives of your friends by increasing the degree of comforting interaction between you. Join groups, encourage spontaneous get-togethers, and attend events together rather than alone.

Don’t sit around waiting for “Mr. or Ms. Right.” Do your best to nourish anyone you can with encouraging, friendly contact. Your supportive remark or genuine smile may be just the mood medicine someone needs to reach out to a potential mate later that day. Why leave each other with the impression that self-stimulation is the only option for good feelings, now that you know social connections are better medicine?

Offer what compassionate friendliness you can, but be clear about your boundaries. As you reach out, think of yourself as a surrogate brother or sister. You are not trying to seduce, or impress, someone. Sometimes it helps to view each new acquaintance as “the person who may introduce me to my next partner,” rather than as a potential partner. This lets you stay focused on how you can support, rather than manipulate, someone.

This mindset also lets you see your new acquaintance more clearly. If she or he is self-medicating with substances or activities, and not yet willing to let them go, then she or he may also not be ready for karezza. If you choose to nurture someone who is stuck in this familiar limbo, limit your contact to activities during which the person is not around the substance or cues associated with his or her dependency. For example, suggest a walk, rather than meeting for a drink. If you’re in a relationship with someone who is stuck in addiction, you may have to make a painful choice.



// If you are unbalanced, you have cravings. Cravings left unattended lead to addiction. If you have cravings and addictions it's hard to follow wfpbd.


// THE MYTH OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY
Face it. The neurochemical changes at orgasm instantly free us of our need for other people—at least for a bit. Dopamine drops. Who needs love? Only when one takes into account the effects, and escalation, of the full passion cycle does the reality become evident. As German writer Ariadne von Schirach lamented,

People who spend so much of their time sitting in front of a computer with their trousers down or their skirts up have little time or interest left for relationships.… Ninety percent of men and eighty-six percent of women [masturbate] regularly. And, in the last thirty years, masturbation among women has increased by fifty percent.… Women have become a more horrific version of men, readily expressing their displeasure over lack of sexual compliance. Men have become insecure and have fled to the Internet. Both are approaching a state of narcissistic lunacy, and solidarity is something that seems attainable only among friends.345

//****************** Why do you think on the restaurant says try at least once in your life but the same thing does not apply to military service for example "Try hardcore discipline at least once in your life". So you can release the brake, go downhill were it's easy, and be taken advantage of over and over again, because now you are either an overuser or an addict. Merchants know some of the flaws of your brain and exploit it.

YOUR INNER COMPASS
Try as you might, you never make a decision without consulting your reward circuit. And it’s a good thing you do—much of the time.105 It helps you know instinctively which course of action is likely to be most rewarding. It also helps you assess other people, so you know whom to trust and love. Mr. Spock notwithstanding, people with damage to this part of the brain, who must rely solely on the logical skills of the rational brain to make decisions, cannot make sound decisions.

*****************
Your reward circuitry, although blindingly efficient, has a couple of major weaknesses. First, evolution shaped it over many millions of years. This means it is not well suited to aspects of modern life that have recently changed a lot. For example, sugar was scarce in our ancestors’ environments, but it is everywhere in today’s Western diet. Alas, you are programmed to grab high-calorie foods without thinking.

*****************
Second, your reward circuitry serves your genes before it serves you. You may want a long, healthy life with a harmonious intimate relationship. Your reward circuitry, however, is programmed to urge you to behave impulsively at times, so that you engage in behaviors that favor passing on your genes via different mates. The result? You are likely to experience especially loud, gut-level impulses from this trusted, but somewhat treacherous, part of your brain. It can twist your values without your conscious awareness.

//*************************
DOPAMINE—THE SHARPEST ARROW IN CUPID’S QUIVER
Dopamine is the prime gadfly that activates your reward circuitry, where it equates with eager anticipation. A little bit of dopamine activating the right nerve cells makes life seem worth getting up for in the morning. Too much, and you may bounce around like popcorn; too little, and you may sink into apathy instead.

Dopamine itself is what motivates you. You’re not craving ice cream or sex with that film star. You don’t even want to win the lotto or bungee jump. You’re actually seeking more stimulation of your reward circuitry. The bigger the surge of dopamine in response to some activity (or person), the greater your perception that it is rewarding. Chocolate cake triggers more dopamine than boiled Brussels sprouts.

Our entire economy plays upon our evolutionary drives. When you enter a movie theater and smell the popcorn, your dopamine rises and stimulates your reward circuitry. You crave that tub of buttery corn. Similarly, the supermodel next to the new BMW signals your mammalian brain that sex, money, and status are right there, in exchange for your credit card. Such a deal.

*************************************************
When we chase things in our lives, we’re not after the things as much as the feelings associated with high dopamine. Hedge-fund moguls didn’t need any more money, but their dopamine rose at the chance to outsmart others via those treacherous credit default swaps. No wonder deregulation felt like a great idea. The same highly motivating dopamine feeling is behind the drive to be Number One. Both the alpha chimp in a troop and a tycoon like Bill Gates raise their dopamine by dominating others. The washed-up boxing champ who keeps coming back is missing the dopamine of going for another big win.

Addictions, too, are governed by the reward circuitry. So, for example, junk food, gambling (in casino or stock market), porn-masturbation, alcohol, and shopping can all increase dopamine if they appeal to you. It’s why they can become addictive, as we will see.

//
ENTER CUPID
Our reward circuitry is also where we fall in and out of love. Either we perceive someone as rewarding—that is, our dopamine surges at the thought of being with him or her—or we don’t (no surge). Think back to the Coolidge effect. When the bull approaches a cow he has already serviced this season, no dopamine surge. Unserviced cow? Big surge.

This mechanism is subconscious; the rational brain isn’t calling the shots. You cannot force yourself to fall in love or stay in love, any more than you can will yourself to digest a meal or fall asleep. Unless you do something to steer around your underlying mating program, you are likely to fall in and out of love only on Cupid’s commands—despite your best intentions and most sincere vows.

Not only does dopamine rise as we become aroused, it also surges for novelty and taking risks. Suppose your reward circuitry stops responding positively to your mate. The chance to have condomless sex with your co-worker in a dicey tryst may seem like a great idea—regardless of the reality.

“When sex evaporated from my marriage bed,” recounted a friend, “I thought that what had been missing was passion.” Continuing:

In fact, I prayed for the return of what I called “passion” in my life. It surfaced in the form of a red-haired Scorpio who looked excellent in hot pants. At some point during the stormy ride that followed, I stumbled upon a dictionary definition of passion. “Any intense emotion,” it said, “such as the sufferings of Jesus upon the cross.” Sure enough, I had found passion, all right. Brief as it was, our relationship made crucifixion look kind of appealing. It also resulted in twins.

Dopamine is released in response to expectations—rather than actual levels of pleasure. Something that is better than expected results in a bigger surge of dopamine. Think of hitting the jackpot while gambling. In fact, your reward circuitry readily learns to ignore familiar sources of pleasure in favor of things that initially registered as “unexpectedly compelling,” whether or not they still provide pleasure, or have even grown unpleasant. This is why clicking onto porn Web sites can leave a big impression. It’s also why sex with the same partner can become routine—unless you are managing your dopamine levels with karezza and bonding behaviors.

Buddha’s Second Noble Truth: Suffering is caused by craving and aversion.

A dopamine surge is like the rake of a cowboy’s spur. It urges you to exert yourself endlessly, to want the best of whatever is on your horizon, and even to seek out new horizons. This is good when directed toward completing a workout or getting a degree. Yet if you aren’t using your rational brain to help steer, this primitive mechanism can set you on one meaningless quest after the other in search of a brief sense of eager anticipation—and no lasting fulfillment. This is why chasing the dopamine surges related to junk food or affectionless sexual stimulation is more likely to lead to recurring dissatisfaction than happiness.

Consider what happens when sadistic scientists put a starving rat on one side of a grid with electric current running through it and food on the other side. The rat will not cross the pain-producing grid. Yet put a rat with an electrode planted in her reward circuitry on one side of the grid and a lever she knows will stimulate her reward circuitry on the other, and she’ll dash across the grid to tap that lever nonstop.

Stimulation of her reward circuitry becomes her top priority, because it’s telling her inner compass that a big reward is just around the corner. She will ignore food, even if starving, or abandon her unweaned pups just to tap that lever until she drops. If the rat is male, he’ll ignore a receptive female to tap it until he drops.106 Humans implanted with similar electrodes (decades ago) experienced a constant urge to tap their levers, as well as intense sexual arousal—but not pleasure or orgasm itself. They also reported an undercurrent of anxiety.

"The passion you fulfill is the passion you kill. The most wonderful, soaring feeling known to all mankind … amounts to no more than a narcotic high, a temporal state of mania."

Intense stimulation of the reward circuitry (which some call the pleasure-reward pathway) is so overpoweringly compelling that the anticipated reward eclipses the fear of pain. As we’ve seen, instead of an electrode your body uses surges of dopamine to activate your reward circuitry.

If you’ve ever had an orgasm it won’t surprise you to learn that dopamine shoots up as you become aroused, and peaks at climax.108 It also rises as you pursue a novel mate—and more so when she or he plays hard to get. These are the most powerful dopamine surges available to you (short of taking drugs). They can, in fact, lead to altered states if sufficiently intense. You can get as high as a kite—and not necessarily in a good way—on your own chemical messengers. (We’ll talk about ways to achieve a more balanced, yet also pleasurable, neurochemical state later.)

Orgasms and potential new mates are compelling largely because of the dopamine released in our reward circuitry. Indeed, anthropologist Helen Fisher found that MRIs of those who are infatuated reveal that their reward circuitry is activated.109 That is, romantic love is not an emotion, but rather a drive, activated by your response to that special someone. Whether her subjects were feeling euphoric or anxious about their romances, they were equally motivated by dopamine to be with their beloveds. On the other hand, when deprived of their beloveds, they suffered intensely.

"Think about it. If you’re designing a species and you want to make sure it does things that are crucial for survival—like eating and reproducing—you create a system that’s all about pleasure so it wants to repeat those things. Then you have dopamine make those behaviors become automatic. It’s brilliant, really."

When falling in love, the parts of the brain that aid with judging character and looking ahead, and the parts that protect us from harm, are switched off. When in this altered state, we’re blind to faults and flooded with the neurochemicals of reward. This is why every mother knows that her newborn is the most beautiful baby on the planet. Infatuation lights up the same areas of the brain as drug addiction; and a romantic breakup can feel like withdrawal from drug use.110

Perhaps you begin to see why lovers committed adultery even when the punishment was to burn at the stake. By means of this effective, well-hidden mechanism deep in the mammalian brain, our ambitious genes often persuade us that any sacrifice is worth the pursuit of passion (and risk of pregnancy).


****************************************************************************************
// THE PASSION CYCLE

Orgasm sets in motion a cascade of programmed neurochemical events, which may continue for approximately two weeks. They change how we feel and how we perceive the world around us, especially a mate. They can speed habituation.

Changed feelings may be subtle and take many forms, such as irritability, cravings for orgasm, fuzzy thinking, emotional neediness, overreactions, and fatigue.

As the mammalian brain triggers habituation, the rational brain generates rationalizations for incompatibility.

The passion cycle can activate the amygdala’s stress response, causing us to misperceive a partner as a threat.


// THE ANTI-LOVE POTION
While you’re declaring your undying love as orgasm approaches, your body is preparing to play a nasty trick on you. The very intensity of your glorious crescendo will trigger a cascade of neurochemical events, which have the power to shift your perception without your awareness. These neurochemical shifts can affect your judgment and how you experience the world. Above all, they can easily tarnish the way you see your lover, and create emotional distance between you. Male or female, it may be two weeks before you are completely free of their effects.

This is the two-week passion cycle, or orgasm cycle. It is perhaps the highest cost of fertilization-driven sex—and a prime reason to master a second way of making love for when conception is not desired. (Kids are expensive. Keeping two households going when unions deteriorate is even more expensive.)

Everyone’s experience of the passion cycle is somewhat different. In most people the cycle’s effects remain subconscious. For example, neither my husband nor I made the connection between orgasm and subsequent malaise earlier in our respective sex lives—although we experienced a lot of both. It was only when we explored karezza (making love without orgasm) that we became aware of a steady increase in lightheartedness and harmony.

Not only have we noticed improvements; we also notice that whenever we do have orgasm (inadvertently), we experience unwelcome shifts in our energy and outlook over the following days. Instead of finding it endearing when he leaves the cupboard doors open, I grumble. He thinks my ever-so-helpful suggestions are irritating. His touch feels more grabby than soothing. For about two weeks these uncomfortable feelings come and go, like erratic waves. They are usually subtle, but can also be quite intense when they intrude. I sometimes experience the most disconcerting effects near the end of the cycle.

Through talking with others, we’ve learned that this cycle takes many different forms. A full list of aftereffects people have mentioned could fill an entire page. Most often they report restlessness, irritability, dissatisfaction, desire for less contact with others, weepiness, anxiety, fatigue, hostility, fuzzy thinking, feelings of insecurity, emotional neediness, compulsive analysis of self or lover, jealousy, burning desire for escape, relief, or oblivion, cravings for substances or activities that raise dopamine, and—our genes’ favorite—attraction to other potential partners. In its extreme form (headaches, debilitating brain fog, exhaustion, muscle aches, severe social anxiety), the cycle has been dubbed post-orgasmic illness 
syndrome (POIS).123 Historically, severe symptoms have also been called post-coital depression, orgastic impotence, and spermatorrhea. The usual “cure” of having more orgasms sometimes offers initial relief but tends to intensify the next passion cycle, as we’ll see.

Most people don’t make the connection between sexual satiety and subsequent uneasiness or emotional friction. For example, no one who is having sex too seldom can even conceive of the possibility that sexual satiety could ever occur, let alone cause a problem. To see the truth, people usually have to be in a relationship and remain physically affectionate but avoid orgasm for a while—and then return to orgasm. Even then, it’s easy to miss the clues. As one woman said:

I feel that the post-orgasmic illness syndrome folks are exceptional because they actually correlated their symptoms with orgasm. I was not able to make the connection until its possible existence was pointed out to me. There were just too many other influences stating exactly the opposite—that the more orgasms the better off you will

Instead of looking inward when we feel irritable or uneasy with no obvious cause, most of us project our uneasiness outward. That is, we look outside ourselves—and often in our partner’s direction—to explain our state of mind. “He used to be so funny; what happened to him?” “Why is she looking at me like that, with that blank stare?” “Why doesn’t he put his laundry in the hamper?” “More new clothing? I’ll be taking it to a charity next month when she’s tired of it.” “I’ve asked him three times to take out the trash. Is he deaf?” “She used to hug me all the time.” “He’d rather be with his friends than with me.” “She’s always talking on the phone.” “Something’s just not working.” These are not the lyrics of love songs.

In fact, these insignificant molehills become mountains of distrust when they lead to fights. And even if you’re not the fighting type, such feelings (and thoughts) may cause your partner to look a lot like another serving of Hamburger Helper instead of your favorite dish. These feelings can also make you less likely to engage in generous, affectionate contact—such as a surprise kiss or a spontaneous foot massage. As we’ll see in Chapter Seven, this decrease in unselfish, affectionate contact delivers an unsuspected subconscious message: emotional bond weakening.

Sometimes you project your changed feelings not onto your mate, but rather onto your boss, your kids, or some other aspect of your life. Then that aspect of your life seems to be the cause of your uneasiness. Sooner or later, however, your mate is likely to feel the withering effects of your shift in perception. If you look for specific emotions, you may not spot them. Just watch for growing distance between you.

I had a wonderful encounter with a beautiful goddess I had known for some time. I decided to sleep over when invited. I got into bed with her, wearing some clothing, and spent the night in a full body snuggle. I woke up so refreshed. It was invigorating. When we did get back together, conversation flowed just as easily. This time we did a full body massage, and ended up having intercourse, with ejaculation.

We have not repeated another physical encounter. For a variety of reasons, we are not meant to be together. But that is OK, and we know we can still be great as friends. Hangover? I don’t think I had one. Because the sexual encounter was sharing- and connecting-focused, and not riding the rails to orgasm as a goal. I think my body relaxed and released more than exploded. However, the difference after the encounters was marked. After just snuggling I felt refreshed, awake, alert, and alive. I could not stop smiling for days! After the final encounter, I was anxious.

What happens? Orgasm feels great. If the story stopped there, the mainstream view that “there’s no such thing as too many orgasms” would be correct. We would associate only the good feelings of sex with a lover—and stay in love indefinitely.

To comprehend how orgasm can change your feelings toward your lover, it helps to understand the physical reality behind your mammalian mating program. This program is being played out in your brain, though it feels like it’s happening only in your genitals. It disguises itself extremely effectively—as perfectly logical reasons why your partner is a jerk, a witch, unsuitable after all, or uninteresting as compared with some hot new person.


// WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN

You’ve probably bumped into the concept of homeostasis. It’s the principle that the body maintains ideal levels of oxygen and blood sugar, an ideal temperature, and so on. If you get cold, your muscles shiver and blood vessels constrict to warm you up; if you get hot, you sweat and your blood vessels expand to cool you down. Keeping in mind this simplified concept that your body strives for optimal conditions, let’s look at the brain and neurochemicals.

Remember those cocaine addicts whose dopamine receptors (the tiny hands that grab neurochemicals) decreased after repeated drug use? Cocaine blasts the reward circuitry so that it pumps out massive amounts of exciting dopamine. This accounts for the high. Then two things happen simultaneously. First, the high begins to fade as the brain disposes of the extra dopamine.

Second, because so much excess dopamine can damage or kill nerve cells, the cells protect themselves by reducing the number of dopamine receptors (little “hands”) on their surfaces. If a thunderstorm rolls in, you close all the windows and wait for it to pass. That’s what the cells do, except they assume that another storm is on the way, and stay closed up for a while. The addict has lowered her sensitivity to dopamine—a substance that helped give her the high.

Now our addict feels rotten. She has two choices: Take more cocaine to jack up her mood artificially by saturating the remaining dopamine receptors, or suffer withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms arise when the reward circuitry is starving for dopamine. Whether you have too few receptors for dopamine, or too little dopamine circulating around the nerve cells, you get the same result. Your reward circuitry batteries are low, leaving you with an acute desire to feel normal again. In this state, anything that promises rapid relief will cause an intense craving. Ironically, this craving is the result of a spike of dopamine. Contentment would be a return to balanced dopamine sensitivity—but that takes time, and will power.

I’m male, 33, and wonder why the majority of times after sex I feel depressed. It could be the greatest sex ever, but afterwards I’m depressed and can’t wait to get away from her.—Don

The dopamine drop happens to a lesser extent even without drugs. For example, if you have a big Thanksgiving meal, you probably experience a slump afterward. Dopamine rises when you’re hungry and drops after you eat, its mission accomplished. Now is when guests traditionally reach for coffee, more alcohol, another dessert, or a cigarette—in order to get their dopamine back up and remain alert enough to make conversation.

Both cocaine and the feast produce an initial pleasurable effect, followed by a less pleasant hangover. The bigger the blast of dopamine in connection with the initial event, the more uncomfortable the aftereffects. After overeating you tend to sit around feeling like a slug for a few hours. Shoot up on methamphetamine and you stay awake for hours, and later sleep for four days.

Dopamine equals anticipation and wanting rather than gratification itself. It is the promise of that juicy roast pig at the end of a long hunt, or a kiss at the end of your first date. Stoked on dopamine, we can waste hours visiting stores (what’s around the corner?), playing video games, fantasizing about someone, clicking to the next porn image (maybe it’s even hotter), or gambling (could be the big one), even if we end up with nothing beneficial to show for it. Dopamine anticipation equates with “the grass is always greener … someplace else.”

The ultimate reward, if any, appears to be related to neurochemicals called opioids, such as endorphins (the body’s natural morphine). Yet, whatever the destination, dopamine is driving the Reward Bus. It fires up in anticipation of whatever our brain perceives as a possible path toward those fleeting feel-good sensations.

A big part of the thrilling rush up to climax is a sharp rise in dopamine levels in the brain. Indeed, pursuit of orgasm is the biggest legal blast of dopamine that we can engineer at will. After all, our reward circuitry didn’t evolve so we could get hooked on cocaine or gambling; it’s there so we will pursue mates and orgasm (among other things). Not surprisingly, when Dutch researcher Gert Holstege scanned the brains of men ejaculating, he commented that the scans resembled brain scans of those shooting heroin.124 In case you’re wondering, the men had fifty seconds to climax, holding their heads completely still while lying in a narrow MRI tube as their female partners assisted. Not surprisingly, researchers reported that much home practice preceded the experiment.

Dopamine spirals upward as you become sexually aroused. Interestingly, a female rat raises her dopamine by playing hard to get, that is, by running away from a potential mate several times before copulating. Her dopamine rises even higher if she receives her preferred rate of copulation (vigorous).125 Apparently her heightened anticipation causes other neurochemical changes that prime her for pregnancy. Might women’s brains have similarities that explain their frequent requests for more foreplay? As we’ve seen, mammals have surprising similarities in their underlying mating programs.

In both sexes, there comes a point where the momentum of rising dopamine may push the person over the edge of climax. Bang! 

Dopamine drops. Other neurochemicals surge, and changes in receptor levels are also set in motion. These adjustments set dopamine levels on an erratic course, preventing it from bouncing back to its ideal baseline level right away. These fluctuating dopamine levels have much to do with changes in libido, outlook, and behavior. (It may also be that sensitivity to dopamine rises and falls in the brain during this time.) Sexually active adults typically go in and out of these dopamine highs and lows frequently, without, of course, realizing that their perception, desire for closer contact, and moods are also flickering.


DOPAMINE—THE LYNCHPIN

At ideal levels, dopamine equates with feelings of well-being and healthy decision-making. We feel optimistic and open, much like pre-pubescent children, who have not yet buckled themselves onto the dopamine roller coaster, and are delighted by everything from bugs to Barbies.

Why do we care if dopamine fluctuates? The three lists on the next page show conditions that researchers have connected with dopamine levels in the brain. (Other neurochemicals can be at work, too. Yet research reveals that changes in a single neurochemical can profoundly alter behavior.) The left column shows some effects of excess dopamine and the right column shows what happens when there is a deficiency. The middle column lists the states of mind and behaviors associated with balanced levels of dopamine. (Think Goldilocks.)

Unusually high or low dopamine can both be crazy-making—or at least perception-distorting. At high levels, dopamine is the “I’ve got to have it, whatever the repercussions” signal that lights up the brain’s reward circuitry. We can become as single-minded as someone clutching a betting stub during a horserace.

Scientists know that high dopamine can drastically alter behavior because of its unexpected effects when given as a drug to treat restless leg syndrome and Parkinson’s symptoms. Mayo Clinic researchers reported that a number of patients taking dopamine agonists (drugs that mimic dopamine) developed uncharacteristic compulsions, including gambling, compulsive eating, increased alcohol use, and hypersexuality.

“When our neurologists tapered the patients off the medication, several reported a dramatic resolution of their problem,” a Mayo spokesman said. “One patient said it was like a light switch going off.”127 Since this side effect has been publicized, hundreds of surprised patients have come forward admitting to uncontrollable addictions that gripped them after taking their prescribed meds.

In contrast, with very low levels of dopamine, we have no drive and no desire to interact. Indeed, recent research confirmed that low dopamine is closely tied to social anxiety (the urge to avoid healthy contact with others).129 Life seems joyless and pointless. We can feel miserable, as if something just isn’t right. Consider the experience of this healthy young medical student whose dopamine was artificially lowered using drugs:

After 7 hours, Mr. A felt more distance between himself and his environment. Stimuli had less impact; visual and audible stimuli were less sharp. He experienced a loss of motivation and tiredness. After 18 hours, he had difficulty waking up and increasing tiredness; environmental stimuli seemed dull. He had less fluency of speech. After 20 hours, he felt confused. He felt tense before his appointment and had an urge to check his watch in an obsessive way.

After 24 hours, Mr. A had inner restlessness, flight of ideas; his ideas seemed inflicted, and he could not remember them. He felt a loss of control over his ideas. After 28 hours, he felt ashamed, frightened, anxious, and depressed. He was afraid that the situation would continue. At that time, blepharospasm [spasm of the eyelid], mask face, and tremor were noted. After 30 hours, he was tired and slept 11 hours. After 42 hours, he had poor concentration. In the next hours, he returned to normal.130

Compare this with the experience of Web site visitors, who suffer a dramatic low after orgasm. Keep in mind that post-orgasmic symptoms, whether mild or severe, are part of a longer cycle, and that dopamine is only one of the players (more in a moment).

After I ejaculate I have brain fog, low energy and I’m tongue-tied. I feel mentally and physically exhausted for a week or longer. Last spring I started experimenting. After two weeks without masturbation, I had incredible drive to do things, think clearly, talk to people easily. I simply felt normal. I can destroy that with one or two masturbations.—Rolf

I suffered from depression since I was about twelve until this year (age twenty-four). My depression was part of bipolar disorder. It has completely gone away since I stopped masturbating. I’m taking some herbs too, but abstaining from orgasm definitely helps a lot with my mood.—Andrea

By now it won’t surprise you to learn that nearly all mood disorders implicate the reward circuitry and related structures. For example, bipolar and schizophrenic psychiatric drugs affect dopamine levels or the reward circuitry. Also, common anti-depression medications appear to act by making the reward circuitry more sensitive to dopamine.131 Unfortunately, when doctors tried to treat addictions by suppressing the reward circuitry, the drugs caused severe depression and even some suicides.132

We need a little caution and a little humility when we’re messing around with our brain chemistry. We are still learning things that are relevant to safety.
—Martha Farah, neuropsychologist


ADDICTION—QUEST FOR MORE MISERY
Notice that addictions are listed above in connection with both high and low dopamine. How can this be? When your dopamine is already high, it’s driving you toward a goal—come hell or high water. That’s when you open another bottle of wine, place that bet you cannot afford, or pursue orgasm to utter exhaustion. When dopamine is low, you easily fall prey to any activity that will raise it again, such as ripping into some junk food or clicking to a porn site. Indeed, a 2006 study showed that low dopamine leads to poor, emotion-based decision making characterized by shortsightedness. Subjects with lowered dopamine had difficulty resisting short-term reward, despite long-term negative consequences.133

The point? Balanced dopamine can keep you from doing stupid stuff.

Also notice that ideal dopamine levels (neither high nor low) are absolutely necessary for healthy bonding. If interactions with your partner don’t produce adequate dopamine (and oxytocin, more on that later), you’ve lost that loving feeling. Both addicts, whose intense cravings equate with dopamine surges, and the clinically depressed, whose emotional flatness—and susceptibility to seeking quick relief—equate with low dopamine, tend to behave in very self-centered ways. Neither group has a good mindset for healthy romance.

People suffering from extremes in dopamine levels can be strongly motivated to self-medicate, or use others, to alter their uncomfortable moods. Often they pursue rapid relief at the cost of setting off another cycle of discomfort—in the form of a minor, or major, withdrawal period. Those with high dopamine can feel jittery and anxious, and be looking for something to take the edge off. Healthy choices might be affectionate touch, meditation, or yoga. Less healthy choices might be liquor, Valium, or marijuana.

***************************************************
What are two of the most potent quick fixes when discomfort strikes on the dopamine roller coaster? Anticipation of a new potential mate or another orgasm. Could this explain the commercial success of romance novels, pornography, and racy magazines teaching seduction and promising better sex? Your reward circuitry—calibrated to react to all things sexual with great fireworks—has trouble distinguishing a virtual mating opportunity from a real one. Even if you do seek your fix from your mate, you may temporarily perceive him or her largely as a collection of body parts beckoning with relief—and not as your beloved.

BALANCE AND BONDING
Dopamine levels matter. They influence us without our conscious awareness. It’s probably evident that the perennial search for sexual satiety pushes lovers back and forth from dopamine excess to dopamine deficiency. When our dopamine is soaring, we see “Mr. or Ms. Right,” or at least someone who looks really hot. But when sensitivity to dopamine drops, we may feel flat, apathetic, dissatisfied, fatigued, or irritable (and especially susceptible to substances and activities that promise quick relief). Dopamine fluctuations can cause mood swings and perception shifts. Even when subtle, they can make intimacy bewildering. We may be looking at each other through rose-tinted glasses one day, and long, dark tunnels the next.

In our experience, how we make love definitely influences our moods and perceptions of each other. I had figured that out years earlier, as recounted. Now it was Will’s turn. When we met, he was secretly abusing alcohol, taking antidepressants for chronic depression, and climaxing about four times each week. Depression and alcoholism ran in his family—his therapist mother had suffered from both. His father taught sex education, and as far as Will was concerned, orgasm caused no problems at all, but he was willing to test karezza-style lovemaking.


A period of intense [sexual] love was followed by a long period of anger; a period of mild love induced a mild irritation. We did not understand that this love and this hatred were two opposite faces of the same animal feeling.

—Leo Tolstoy, in The Kreutzer Sonata


As we experimented, Will remarked repeatedly that he was feeling normal—for the first time as far back as he could remember. Within months he had stopped using alcohol. A year later he was off his depression meds and doing better than ever. These changes were gradual, but made his life far more enjoyable.

It bears repeating that a major theme of this book is that the intense pursuit of orgasm tends to raise dopamine sharply. In fact, a preliminary study with normal subjects showed that brain activity associated with sexual arousal looks like that accompanying drug consumption.134 High dopamine then makes it urgent to find comfort via climax (or else experience severe frustration). The usual relief—orgasm—triggers fluctuations of dopamine over the next two weeks or so. Whenever dopamine or dopamine sensitivity drops, it can register as an even more urgent need to escape the misery. Inflamed libido is thus a function of events in the brain, not the genitals—a theme we will return to in the next chapter.

As noted, the Taoists (among others) observed this phenomenon long ago. They discovered that the way to restore equilibrium is not more orgasm—or abstinence—but, rather, a different approach to sex altogether. Its goal is to ease sexual frustration (that is, to avoid dopamine fluctuations) and stay balanced naturally by means of lots of gentle lovemaking. (We’ll see why careful, affectionate lovemaking can lead to less frustration, not more, when we look at another neurochemical, oxytocin.)

In this way lovers escape their mating program’s uncomfortable seesaw of highs and lows. By altering their behavior, the Taoists altered their neurochemistry. Greater inner balance turned out to be the best way to prevent the buildup of sexual frustration in the first place. In other words, bonding-based lovemaking offers lovers a strategy for tapping greater feelings of well-being and remaining in that healthy column of the above lists.

Although the moment after orgasm feels like it is a return to equilibrium, it is not. The body will return to homeostasis in its own time—at the end of a longer, intricate neurochemical cycle, which we’ll look at next.

Various other neurochemicals showed changes during sexual exhaustion in rats, too. Opioids suppress sexual desire. One rat study compared the rise in opioid levels after a single copulation with the rise after sexual satiety. In both cases, levels had not recovered forty-eight hours later.151 In other words, ejaculation appears to kick off a neurochemical cycle, even if a mammal does not exhaust himself sexually. Females also produce opioids after energetic sex, which seem to inhibit sexual activity and induce prolactin surges over several days.152

Serotonin is another possible link in the post-sexual satiety chain of neurochemical events. It’s released right after orgasm. Like prolactin, it appears to inhibit dopamine (once again, affecting that key neurochemical). Most of us think of serotonin as a good-mood neurochemical, but its effects depend upon which nerve cells it signals. Researchers know serotonin can flatten sexual desire because patients taking antidepressants, which increase serotonin in the brain, often report lower libido. One doctor has even experimented with using SSRIs to ease post-coital depression,153 but might it not be wiser to emphasize soothing bonding behaviors instead of decreasing sexual responsiveness artificially?

**********************************************************
WHAT ABOUT MEN?
In human males it is, of course, impossible (or at least fatal and unethical) to map out post-orgasmic changes in the neurochemicals and receptors deep in the mammalian brain. Nevertheless, scientists have already found unmistakable evidence that the human orgasm cycle extends for at least seven days in men. When they sample the levels of testosterone in men’s blood during the days following orgasm, they see a predictable spike at the seven-day mark.

The results showed that ejaculation-caused variations were characterized by a peak on the 7th day of abstinence; and that the effective time of an ejaculation, is 7 days minimum.154

In short, a man’s orgasm kicks in a reproductive program, not unlike the reproductive program ovulation triggers in a woman. Menstrual cycles vary, but seldom by much, and they feature distinct hormonal spikes (of progesterone and estrogen). Predictable neurochemical surges are not purposeless. For example, it is a spike of testosterone that signals the bones to stop growing in adolescence.

What does a man’s surge of testosterone at day seven signify? Testosterone increases dopamine. Does it make him more susceptible to novel mates—so he doesn’t pester his previous, possibly pregnant, mate? Is it but one domino in a longer neurochemical program? Neither? Both? No one yet knows. One thing is certain: During their counterpart of this cycle, male rats only bother to get it up and get it on for novel females. Past hook-ups just don’t raise their dopamine. This is the Coolidge effect—a form of habituation in which a mammal experiences low dopamine in response to an existing mate, and a thrilling surge of dopamine in response to a novel mate. The neurochemistry that urges us on to additional mates is our genes’ secret weapon—the poison on Cupid’s arrow.

Incidentally, no one knows what testosterone levels do in men practicing karezza (intercourse without orgasm). However, abstaining from sex, and engaging in less sexual activity (orgasm), actually elevate men’s testosterone levels overall, compared with those who are more sexually active.155

After three weeks of abstinence from orgasm, I’m feeling mighty surges. My self-image, never low, is becoming borderline self-admiration. My body is hardening, stomach muscles are showing again, without exercise, even after living off of holiday desserts since Christmas. Where the orgasm-craving urge was a weak sit-in-a-dark-room urge, the testosterone urge is a strong one driving me out the door to meet real women. I read that the testosterone levels of men in 1940 were twice as high as they are nowadays. What’s up?

Although the picture is rudimentary, the neurochemistry of our mating behavior may one day disclose why lovers sometimes see each other so differently during the weeks after sexual satiation. One day he looks like Dr. Jekyll, the next day like Mr. Hyde. One day she looks like Aphrodite, the next like Medusa with live snakes for hair. Given the fact that researchers aren’t yet seeking evidence of a post-orgasmic passion cycle (extended recovery cycle), it’s fascinating that there’s already so much hard evidence of one.

Sexual problems don’t always bespeak deep, dark psychological problems. They may be nothing more than a quirk in the neurobiology of sex.


“TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING … IS EVEN BETTER!”

So said the witty Ms. Mae West. However, too much intense stimulation of the reward circuitry is not better. It’s worse. As we’ve seen, the risk isn’t hairy palms or going blind. It’s ending up on a high-speed treadmill, trying to stay ahead of withdrawal symptoms. Incidentally, too much ejaculation also has physical repercussions beyond changes in the reward circuitry. When men engaged in a “ten-day depletion experience,” ejaculating an average of 2.4 times per day, their sperm output remained below pre-depletion levels for more than five months.172 What other subtle changes might accompany this measurable one—especially in the brain, where the experience of orgasm occurs, and where the controls for testosterone and sperm production lie?

One unwelcome side effect of frequent supranormal stimulation is that normal pleasures—the kinds of simple things that would have delighted our ancestors—gradually lose their capacity to delight us. As biologist Robert Sapolsky remarked:

Unnaturally strong explosions of synthetic experience and sensation and pleasure evoke unnaturally strong degrees of habituation. This has two consequences. As the first, soon we hardly notice anymore the fleeting whispers of pleasure caused by leaves in autumn, or by the lingering glance of the right person, or by the promise of reward that will come after a long, difficult, and worthy task. The other consequence is that, after awhile, we even habituate to those artificial deluges of intensity.… Our tragedy is that we just become hungrier. More and faster and stronger. “Now” isn’t as good as it used to be, and won’t suffice tomorrow.173

Recovering cocaine addicts report that they do not feel pleasure in anything for a while after they stop using.174 Their pleasure response is numbed. Porn addicts report similar experiences:

Porn was easy excitement. I didn’t interact with others because it took too much work, I had to think too hard, and interaction was “boring.” I was numb and my senses were dulled. And I feared they would continue to be that way even after I quit using porn.

I’m dating a woman now for the first time since quitting (months ago). It’s amazing! I am finding her so attractive, just as she is. She’s in her thirties, has two kids, and an average body. She’s not supple and “perky” like the girls in the videos, but I’m more attracted to her real body than I ever was to porn. I never imagined that would happen, and it is so exciting. I had to stop orgasming, and keep off of porn for an extended period of time. That got easier. Eventually I looked around and realized that the colors were back in my life!

Porn users also complain that sex with a partner just doesn’t seem as exciting as it once did (perhaps accounting in part for the rise of sexual enhancement aids). What is going on? The situation can be compared to that of heavy cocaine users who, when responding to sexual stimulation, show measurably less brain activation than control subjects.175

Even though we’re designed to find relationships rewarding, their subtler, healthier rewards don’t generate the supranormal stimulation of an afternoon of vivid erotic imagery—especially not after we have dulled our senses. Pursuit of supranormal stimulation can change perception. A recent study showed that mere exposure to images of sexy females could cause a man to devalue his real-life partner. He rated her lower not only on attractiveness, but also on warmth and intelligence.176 Other experiments show that porn causes men to devalue marital fidelity and makes them more likely to believe that women like rough sex.177 These shifts set off a downward spiral, making partners less likely to engage in the generous affection that actually bonds them and lets them enjoy each other.

CROSS-TOLERANCES
Another risk of supranormal stimulation is what scientists call cross-tolerance. That is, one kind of intense stimulation (or its aftermath) can make someone more likely to reach for other potent stimuli, such as recreational drugs, alcohol, gambling, junk food, or reckless shopping. Stimulation primes the pump, or in this case, the reward circuitry. Potent sexual stimulation, gambling, and cocaine can all offer an addict short-term relief, because they activate dopamine production.

I feel like this addictive impulse has mass, like a balloon, and when I squeeze it in one place by cutting back on porn, it grows larger elsewhere, as in drinking or using drugs.—Matt

Since one addiction lowers the threshold for developing another, sex addicts are more likely to have problems with other addictive behaviors (alcohol, gambling, and so forth).178 Interestingly, teens who are sexually active also use more recreational drugs than those who are not.179 One might argue that teens make these choices due to personality, parenting, or other factors—and they may. However, researchers also found that hamsters that have previously mated are more likely to use amphetamines than are virgin hamsters. 

Something about sexual activity made the little critters more likely to dabble in drugs, without any peer pressure or lousy parenting.180 Sexual experience, like repeated drug use, produced long-term changes in their brains,181 and sensitized dopamine pathways.182 In fact, the more sexual encounters they had, the more their dopamine rose during sex.183

Sugar, by the way, can also affect the brain this way, producing cross-tolerance with drugs of abuse.184 Feed rats oodles of sweets for weeks and they become more sensitive to other psychostimulants, such as alcohol, amphetamine, or morphine, than rats on a normal rat diet. Changes in dopamine (and opioid) receptors are thought to be the culprit. Similar changes are seen in the brains of rats on cocaine and heroin.185

Whatever the precise mechanism, an excessive reward stimulus primes your brain for a second experience or substance. Your reward circuitry is on that escalating neurochemical roller coaster, seeking satisfaction, but too shortsighted to realize that more stimulation will soon leave you profoundly unsatisfied. In contrast, affectionate social interaction, which also activates the reward circuitry—meaning it, too, feels good—does just the opposite. It is soothing enough to help protect you from the urge to reach for another stimulating fix. Friendly social interaction therefore leads to greater satisfaction. We’ll look at how it does this in later chapters.

Unfortunately, as we saw in Chapter Five, low dopamine is associated with social anxiety. Thus frequent masturbation can keep you from pursuing your healthy longings for the good feelings of socializing. Orgasm’s greater intensity seems more valuable to your mammalian brain, because it responds so unerringly to supranormal stimulation.

The interesting part is the mind-shift that is taking place since I cut back on masturbation. I’ve gone three to four weeks now. I feel I’m working with a “new neurochemistry,” in which I interact with other people on a whole new level, because I NEED to. I absolutely NEED to. Exercise, low-key healthy diet (no hormone-polluted beef, etc.), and meditation helped ease the transition, but the “cure” is human contact, showing love and receiving it back. I admit that during the recovery period, I sometimes felt like, “Okay, now I have to ejaculate, or semen will either pour out of my ears, or I’ll go crazy.” But somehow I resisted, and the craziness and depression of the first couple of weeks have changed to a calm, serene state of mind. The urge has dissipated, and my satisfaction from interacting with people is much greater.—Max

Could achieving balance in our sex lives be especially helpful in soothing all cravings? Was Freud right that masturbation addiction is close to the heart of all addictions?186

//
THE PLASTIC BRAIN
In a moment we’ll consider the experience of the men who left their compulsive porn use behind in more detail, but first let’s look at why it is so challenging to change directions.

Your brain is not a machine or a computer. It’s as malleable as clay, not only when you’re young, but also long after your hair turns gray. You constantly construct new brain circuits. This is both bad news and good news. It’s bad news because you can reinforce unhealthy behaviors until they become bad habits, or even compulsions. It’s good news because you can leave those habits behind and consciously steer for behaviors you want. In fact, each memory, experience, and insight leads to a corresponding change in the structure and functioning of your brain.

As you will recall, a neural pathway, or circuit, consists of a group of interconnected nerve cells. Some pathways are hardwired, such as the reward circuit and reflexes. Place honey on a human tongue and the reward circuit lights up. Shine a beam of light into an eye and the pupil is bound to constrict. These pathways are pretty much the same in all of us.

￼
The same surge of dopamine that thrills us also consolidates the neuronal connections responsible for the behaviors.… [Internet porn users get] massive amounts of practice wiring these images into the pleasure centers of the brain, with the rapt attention necessary for plastic change.

—Norman Doidge, The Brain that Changes Itself

We form other pathways from scratch as we learn and create memories. Climb on a bike for the first time and the nerve cells throughout the brain that control movement and balance come alive with electrical impulses. They spurt neurochemicals into the synapses with the message “Let’s form a strong pathway!” Relevant nerve cells sprout branches, which reach out to each other and create efficient communication at their synapses. The more you work at balancing on two wheels, the stronger the connections between the intertwining vines of nerve cells. Years later you can jump on a bike, activate that circuit, and zip down the road without thinking. As the saying goes, “Nerve cells that fire together wire together.”

Learning and memory are pathways of connected nerve cells—whether they consist of a few connected nerve cells, or millions. When enough neurochemicals are released into the synapses between cells, communication between nerve cells can become a scream: “Tighten up these connections. We have to remember this. It’s important!”

Some learning does not involve repetition. A circuit will form instantly if an event has a lot of significance or emotional impact. If a child burns her hand on a hot stove, the synapses are so overwhelmed that the event is etched into her brain. As the saying goes, once is enough. Other examples might be a birth, a car accident, or sexual abuse.

￼
Habits are at first cobwebs, then cables.

—Spanish proverb

For our purposes, however, we can imagine circuits in the brain as footpaths. If you decide to take a shortcut to the movie theater through a field of tall grass, you may find it heavy going at first. Yet if you keep trampling down the grass, you need less and less effort. Eventually the path is just dirt, or maybe even a rut (if you’re watching too many movies). These pathways are the memories, skills, and habits we cultivate.

// 
IN A RUT
The significance of the brain’s plasticity is that consciously or unconsciously, we are always learning behaviors that strengthen neural connections and mold our brain. It matters where we seek our stimulation in the present, because those things automatically direct our future attention.

Learning is great when we use it constructively to master a skill we want to have such as playing an instrument or learning a language. However, we can use the same process to lay down damaging pathways, such as chewing our fingernails when nervous, cutting ourselves when anxious (it releases endorphins, an opiate-like substance), or smoking a cigarette after every meal.

Pathways can lead to other pathways. For example, if I’m walking with a friend and we meet a panting Doberman, I may freeze with my heart racing and turn pale, while she runs up to the dog and pats it. My “Doberman pathway” leads to my innate fight-or-flight pathway because I once had a bad experience with a Doberman. In contrast, her childhood pet was a Doberman, so her “Doberman pathway” leads to her reward circuitry. Our individual neural “ruts” can thus trip the switches of our fundamental drives.

The mammalian brain’s job is to seek what is pleasurable and link it with a reward response, and avoid what is potentially harmful by linking it with a defensive response. It is always asking the basic question, “Is this agreeable or disagreeable?” The rational brain helps to shape the answers to that question by analyzing our circumstances. Trolling the shopping mall might not connect with my husband’s reward circuitry at all (except for the lingerie store display). Yet for some shoppers, even the thought of a trip to the mall activates a string of neurons firing right into the reward circuitry.

In essence, addiction is merely learning. (So is recovery!) The phenomenon of addiction is complex, but dopamine and the reward circuit are central to understanding it. Some things, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, or an electrode, act directly on nerve cells in the reward circuit. Other experiences and behaviors activate circuits that have formed strong connections to (and light up) the reward circuit. Each “stream” flows into its specific river. Heavily reinforced pathways—and the sensory cues that turn them on, such as hearing slot machines for gamblers or spotting a suggestive image for porn addicts—flip on intense desire via the reward circuit.

As we have seen, overstimulation can set off a lingering, or recurring, drop in dopamine, a decline in receptors, or both. The addict’s reward circuitry is stuck idling when it needs to be in gear for him (or her) to feel normal. Very little electricity is flowing along this critical circuit.

How did the addict get to this point? His brain initially registered a behavior as intensely rewarding and created pathways to remember the actions leading to it. The more enticing or exciting (extreme or shocking) his destination, the bigger the brain’s motivation to get out the weed-whacker and mow a path, and then wear down a rut, so he visited as often as possible.

At some point, the addict’s rut became the path of least resistance. His mammalian brain had learned that it led to an infusion of dopamine, but it couldn’t factor in the ultimate cost of that short-term relief (withdrawal misery). Only his rational brain could do that, and he could hardly hear it over the “noise.” Especially when tired, angry, bored, lonely, under stress, or suffering from withdrawal discomfort, his mammalian brain automatically shoved him back on the coaster.

￼
Once the brain becomes less sensitive to dopamine, it “becomes less sensitive to natural reinforcers” such as the “pleasure of seeing a friend, watching a movie, or the curiosity that drives exploration.”

—Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse

Now, paths that once led to other rewarding aspects of his life—such as time with family and friends, playing ball, or even leisurely foreplay—fell into disuse, because his inner compass had increasing difficulty resisting the ready relief of his addiction. Grass and weeds filled those other paths. The connections between relevant nerve cells weakened. His priorities rearranged themselves without his conscious choice.

Addiction results from persistent changes in brain structures and function. Both drugs and behaviors can create ruts. What matters is not type of stimulus, but rather strength of pathway. So gambling and porn use can be as addictive as abused substances if the pathways are strong enough.187 In short, addiction is a brain disease that shows up as compulsive behavior.188

Again, once your “beast brain” registers something as valuable, it hijacks the rational part of your brain to rivet your attention on associated cues. When most of us walk down the street, we notice the people we pass, the dogs, or the red Corvette. When an alcoholic walks down the street, she notices the bar. If she hears familiar sounds (cues) as she nears it, the pathway to her reward circuitry lights up and she may think “Just one drink won’t hurt.” She is in a slightly altered, high-dopamine state, as heavily reinforced neural pathways fire up.

I don’t need to look at pornographic images; they are all hardwired into my brain. Even though I haven’t used porn for weeks, I still see vivid images when I close my eyes and it makes abstinence from masturbation very difficult. Still having wet dreams, too.—Victor

A minority of us are especially sensitive to the signals that encourage excess. Greater impulsivity, novelty-seeking, fewer dopamine receptors in different parts of the brain, and childhood stress are all associated with susceptibility to risky behavior and/or addiction.189

However, it looks like vast majority of us can get hooked on superstimulating versions of natural reinforcers like food and sex. Two-thirds of Americans are now overweight. How many can’t resist unlimited access to Internet porn? A nationwide 2014 poll revealed that twenty-three percent of adult men ages 18-30 believe they may be addicted to Internet porn. Another ten percent are unsure. (The corresponding percentages for women are six percent perhaps addicted and one percent unsure.)190 Two-thirds of Americans are now overweight. How many can’t resist unlimited access to Internet porn?

//
THE OTHER WAY OF EASING SEXUAL TENSION
Now that you understand the importance of bonding behaviors and how easy they are to use—as long as you keep giving and frequent foremost in your mind—let’s return to the question of how lovers can meet their needs for relief from sexual tension. Many people regard this challenge as more of a male issue, with good reason. On average, men produce ten to twenty times the high-octane testosterone women do. Testosterone increases dopamine, that craving neurochemical. One result is that men tend to be proceptive (willing to initiate sex) a lot of the time. Women tend to be most proceptive around ovulation, thanks to their own sex hormones.232

Whatever your gender, you probably experience sexual frustration as the strongest weapon in your genes’ arsenal. If you can’t resolve your sexual tension in a relationship, you are keenly motivated to add a lover on the side (real or two-dimensional), or move on to a relationship where you can resolve it—at least temporarily. Sadly, as we’ve seen, the harder you try to resolve your frustration through better or more frequent orgasm with any partner, the more you trigger the sexual satiety that can push mates apart. You are programmed to be unable to find lasting sexual satisfaction that way with a mate, because you have evolved to see a sex partner as less and less rewarding over time.

If you’ve realized that heating things up throws you onto biology’s script, and avoiding sex leads to frustration, or the stagnation of a sexless union, you may want to try karezza, that is, bonding-based lovemaking. You ease your sexual tension completely (intercourse included), without resorting to orgasm. It is simple, but very different.

One way to decide if you want to add karezza to your lovemaking repertoire is to try it for a while—and then return to fertilization-driven sex. In fact, my husband and I often remark that we learn the most about karezza from our inadvertent orgasms. During the two weeks after an orgasm, we notice a temporary dimming of good feelings, and we are always delighted when, like clockwork, we come back into sync at the end of the cycle.

When I began learning bonding-based lovemaking, my habits around sex were so ingrained that they got in the way without me realizing it. It’s not so easy to leave behind all those familiar landmarks of foreplay geared toward orgasm. I remember thinking to myself that it is no wonder humanity easily forgets about this gentle, affectionate approach despite its benefits. Initially it feels all wrong. Also, I just couldn’t believe how effortless karezza was.

For a long time I’d been doing Taoist-style sex with my wife with good results—using exercises, lovemaking techniques, and energy visualizations. However, I decided to set it aside temporarily to learn more about karezza. The first thing I noticed was that karezza got the same results as my old Taoist practices. But karezza required no specialized energy work. All I did was to slow way down, with 

periods of near stillness while engaged in sex and breathed slow, deep breaths. I did nothing else. Anyone could do karezza.

I soon started to sense another feeling that I didn’t recognize—a deep, satisfying feeling. I guess it was the oxytocin, the cuddle hormone. It feels like peace and love all mixed up together—a sensation of being in love with life.—Larry

Eventually I realized that karezza is indeed simple and effortless (though certainly not easy at first). Its real challenge is that it does not produce rapid, obvious results (as, for example, a new foreplay technique might). Karezza’s effects are cumulative. I needed several weeks of pleasant, but patient, consistency to see why I had made the effort to try it. During that time, I experienced a growing sense of empowerment, optimism, and connectedness with others. I felt as if I were “in the flow.” Yet these changes seemed so natural (and well-deserved), that it was easy to miss the link between cause and effect.

￼
Be like a postage stamp. Stick to one thing until you get there.


// BIRTH OF THE ECSTATIC EXCHANGES
Even after I stopped struggling toward some confusing valley orgasm, I was still somewhat perplexed. I knew that the kind of lovemaking I was trying to learn involved avoiding orgasm. Yet trying to avoid orgasm wasn’t any more relaxing than striving for it. In fact, making love as usual, but without orgasm, was like walking along a knife’s edge. It never succeeded for long, and it also led to frustration and irritability at times—perhaps because of high dopamine.

During this point in my learning curve, I was also noticing that the effects of orgasm lingered for about two weeks—and that it was harder to stay on the nearside of orgasm during that recovery period. If my partner and I saved intercourse for when we were back in balance after the passion cycle, it was definitely less frustrating and more satisfying.

Yet what were we supposed to do while we were passing up the rewards of conventional sex, and awaiting karezza’s soothing benefits? Like Scheherazade of One Thousand and One Nights, I realized that I would have to come up with entertaining activities that would give us something to do with our powerful sexual attraction. I also realized that I’d have to do it without relying on habitual foreplay. “Heat ’em up” foreplay, such as oral sex, that didn’t culminate in orgasm was a recipe for crankiness. To resolve this dilemma, I began to come up with ways to pamper each other that would leave us feeling satisfied.

Thus the Ecstatic Exchanges were born—a three-week program of sensual, lighthearted activities for adults, which can be found at the end of this book. Why three weeks? I had heard somewhere that it took about three weeks to solidify a new habit. Later I learned that, according to neuroimmunophysiologist Monika Fleshner, your brain will register more eager anticipation for a new regime (that is, start to produce a healthy amount of dopamine in response to it) if you force yourself to change your behavior for at least two weeks.234

Meanwhile, of course, you also have to avoid your usual habits. In fact, the more radically and thoroughly you alter your behavior when creating a new pathway in the brain, the easier it is to create one.235 And don’t worry. Weeds will never grow over your brain pathway for fertilization-driven sex; it’s wired into all of us. You can easily reactivate it when you wish to compare your karezza results with conventional sex.

In my efforts to rival Scheherazade, I designed the first two weeks of activities without intercourse. (Talk about radically different behavior!) I had discovered that it was useless to attempt non-goal-oriented intercourse while contending with lingering flares of sexual frustration due to a passion cycle. Whenever I had tried it, my devious genes came out on top.

I also figured out (the hard way) that nakedness is a loud signal to the mammalian brain that a fertilization opportunity has arrived and requires urgent attention. The presence of underwear and a shirt (if female) tends to mute that signal. In established relationships, even this scanty garb helps re-establish a mini-courtship during this two-week interval. It creates a fresh, even virginal, mindset in which it’s easier to forget past resentments and gain a new emotional start.

With all this in mind, I gathered a series of playful, affectionate activities—consisting of all my other favorite things about sexual intimacy. That list turned out to be a lot longer than I first thought possible: head rubs, back-scratching, gentle stroking, gazing into each other’s eyes, hand and foot massages, back massages, and so forth—followed by snuggling, kissing, and sleep.

My partner and I were amazed at how much we enjoyed two weeks of this mutual pampering. By the end of that time we were effortlessly seeing each other’s wings and halo. True, if a lot of honeymoon neurochemistry was flying around, we sometimes spent the first few nights more awake than asleep. Yet within about three days, that racy feeling started to shift, leaving us both refreshed, sleeping better, and still eager to spend time together. In this way, a lover and I could transition from the usual way of making love to karezza—and still relish every moment.

We are awed by what is happening. We’re into the Exchange just before the one with actual coupling. Wow. I lay there on the bed at one point this morning, and after a long, long stretch of pranayama-type breathing, all I could do was laugh out loud for a while. I felt so high and so grounded at the same time!!!—Lance

Over time, I learned that this two-week period, with lots of affection and absolutely no goal of sexual intercourse, was excellent balm for two, quite different, afflictions. With a new lover it helped keep our fiery honeymoon neurochemistry from galloping off with us. On the other hand, when a passion cycle had erupted into emotional distance, this two-week refuge allowed us to come back into harmony while nurturing each other safely. It seemed to snap us out of any habituation blues and give us a fresh start. In both cases, when we added intercourse in week three, we were more likely to find karezza-style lovemaking deeply satisfying.

Another gift of the first two weeks of the Exchanges is that couples who are not ready for intercourse, or incapable of it, can still experience how fulfilling bonding activities alone can be.

In life you are dealt a hand of cards and you play the game with what you have. Some people are born with all kinds of weaknesses and they have to manage somehow. Just because for example alcohol gives you more pleasure than others that does not mean you should become an alcoholic, just because everyone around you eats animal products and processed food that does not mean you are doomed to follow. Change what you can for the better, learn to live with the rest, you don't have a better strategy neither does anyone else. Easy words hard to put into practice.


You have to recognize all the bad stuff a wrong diet can do to a human, see all that misery and run from it to a better goal, to an image of you as healthy and stronger version. Because if you want happiness in life you must have a base for it. You want to keep sickness, depression etc away, exercise and nutrition are big chunks from the whole that will help you.

// Meat has a certain story that embedded it in our culture. You see in order to get meat you had to hunt, the hunt presents opportunities for males to distinguish themselves through capability. Leaders are being formed, alpha males. The ones that get more meat are the ones that contributed the most. Once you have meat you can offer it to females(because they are not very good at hunting). If a female joins the hunt and she is at that part of the cycle were she can be fertilized the males go crazy in trying to impress her.

// Epicurus
For Epicurus, the purpose of philosophy was to help people attain a happy, tranquil life characterized by ataraxia (peace and freedom from fear) and aponia (the absence of pain). He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends.

One of the things that he said was enjoy the little pleasures of life like a simple meal. I encountered this philosophy in Way Of The Peaceful Warrior 

"If you have enough money to satisfy your desires, Dan, you are rich. But there are two ways 
to be rich: You can earn, inherit, borrow, beg, or steal enough money to meet expensive desires;
 or, you can cultivate a simple lifestyle of few desires; that way you always have more than enough money.
"Only the warrior has the insight and discipline to make use of that second way.
Full attention to every moment is my desire and my pleasure. Attention costs no money; your only investment is training.
That's another advantage of being a warrior,
“The secret of happiness you see is not found in seeking more but in developing the capacity to enjoy less”

****************
The idea is to get little drips of dopamine and this will keep you going. Never thought I will be able to do that.
****************** Tell the story with rats
This reminds me of the story with rats, that died because everything was to easy. You want stimulation, so you don't just feel alive, stimulation will keep you alive.

// Idiocracy the movie made a strong impression because it's possible for that kind of future. When you offer the easy way on large scale people will go downhill on their own, quick and easy dopamine just go downhill. Sure in the long run you are going to suffer but you can get instant, cheap gratification by engaging in hedonism. No positive stimulation results in decay.

**************************
The story will be in the story section.
Also tell the story of the fat boy and pretty girl with gorgeous parents. Also the story of high achiever woman and how she made her daughter play soccer but she was not into it. The kids were not stimulated.

That's why I like training, you provide the challenge and the difficulty witch you can adjust.

// Gillfoyle quote about cryptocurency

His quote stroke me at "myspace Friendster they both died but they paved the way for other social media tripe like Facebook and Twitter to completely overrun the planet".

Some things are in the process of getting to that product or service that is about as good as it gets. We don't get things right, right away, we adjust, in time we reach at, as good as we can.


// Our brains are not designed for happily ever after(never fully satisfied for long periods of time after achieving what we want), they are designed to want, to chase anything that gives a lot of dopamine. You will never be satisfied unless you get used to live a life were you get constant small drips of dopamine. Too much or too low dopamine throws you out of balance.

Stagnation leads to death, literally(story with rats). Stimulation is the key.

The way to balance is in motion. You want to do things, so you can have little achievements that give you  little dopamine, you do this often and you will have a constant stream of dopamine. The body and mind always in motion.

Henry Rollins "I'm like a hound dog, alway doing something or in the search of doing something". This is a lesson to do things that are worthy and use them to fuel our existence. He also keeps a track of what's he reading what's he doing, accomplishing, he keeps track of his progress, this also helps to fuel him to do more.
He also said this lifestyle is not suitable for a relationship "On a Friday/Saturday night girlfriend ask where are we going out ? What are we going to do ?", "Well, you could watch me write for four hours.". This does not go well with relationships.

//
Be very careful of letting other do things for you that you can do yourself. You can become resentful and bitter. This can be seen often in children, the parent will do everything and the child never grows. The potential was devoured.

It's surprising how humans with great empathy can destroy/devour the one/ones they love, and not even seeing it. By caring too much, doing a too much for a person you smother their potential, and they might become bitter and resentful. You want to offer just enough so that person can walk on the road of becoming a better person, walking on that road is energizing and rewarding.

People that empathizing too much are also very hostile to other groups, seen as threat to the ones they want to protect. That can lead to violence so be careful.

// This is very important: "Neurons that fire together, wire together." Be very careful of your actions, keep and eye on your habits, once you have them it's hard to undo them. Repeated actions actually change your brain, and you have habits now.

Did you know that there are tiny signaling substances flowing through your body and brain, controlling everything you do and think—from blinking your eye and breathing to fighting an infection and, possibly, remembering last New Year’s Eve? The two most common terms for these chemical messengers are hormones and neurotransmitters. By definition, hormones are chemical messengers released from glands, such as testosterone and estrogen, which circulate in the blood. Neurotransmitters, as the name suggests, transmit information from nerve cell to other nerve cells or organs. Examples would be serotonin and dopamine. Scientists used to differentiate between hormones and neurotransmitters, but as they’ve learned more, they’ve found that many hormones affect nerve cells in the brain, and many neurotransmitters are at work throughout the body. We’ll just use the term “neurochemical” for both.

There are probably hundreds of different neurochemicals, each with its own message. Every mood, desire, urge, and feeling of love or fear corresponds with a swing in neurochemicals.

// Because the female brain and male brain is more different than we like to think it is, we will never fully understand each other, and that's okay. We evolved to be complementary, men and women stay together because they are complementary not because they are similar.

// <story> -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Carla’s story exemplifies how many of the therapeutic approaches to help us stop needing male attention probably won’t help. There are lots of exceptions, of course. Some women will find success with twelve-step programs or with the sort of visualization that Carla described. But most of us don’t, because unlike most addictions, part of what we are after is perfectly healthy—love, attention, and sex. Not only is it perfectly healthy, but it’s also necessary to a satisfying life.

So, before anything else, girls like us have to accept that that part of us that desperately wants attention, that desperately wants to be loved, is never going away. That time is past. Way back when, my mother didn’t love me enough, caught up in her own narcissism. Mandy’s father left when she was two years old, and she can count the amount of times she’s seen him since on one hand. Carla’s parents were so busy with their own unhappiness that they didn’t care to see hers. The other girls and women I spoke to had mothers who tried to kill themselves, fathers who ignored them, fathers who bullied and were sexually inappropriate or outright molested. Others were raped or simply became caught up in the cultural pressure to be sexy and to put out so that guys would find them worthwhile.

We all have our stories. They are ours to keep, a part of what makes us who we are. We will never be rid of them. Never. When you can swallow that fact, when you can acknowledge that you will always feel that ache, that it will resurface every once in a while, and that it is only yours and that no one else has the capacity to make it feel better, then you are ready to move toward real change.

-- I should listen to their story or tell them my story about nutrition. Tell that I cannot change the information in their head or how they will feel when they hear what I have to say. Maybe you already have an idea or know this stuff and you just want confirmation. That's why I should listen their story a bit, also ask questions about why they want to change and how they got to me(useful to know, if it's from a site or from past clients, acquaintances)

************** Ketchup story *************
Once when I was at a friend we ate pasta. And I asked for ketchup, even though I was an introvert, and I was ashamed, I still asked without thinking, because now I had a habit of putting ketchup on almost everything. Even my other friend who was invited was ashamed in my place and told me to cut it out(with the intend of be grateful with what your host gave you). I still feel ashamed when I remember that. So how did I end up there ?

Business people are paying scientists, chefs, professional taste tester etc. to make their product taste the right proportion of sweet, sour, fat , maybe umami, to increase the pleasure response in your brain(the same pathway for cocaine light up for food and sex too) and get you hooked on the product. 

(The umami taste comes from the presence of the amino acid glutamate — or glutamic acid)

There is a lot of knowledge aimed against you with a lot of motivation(money), to make you a customer, an overuser and maybe an addict. You have to realize there are people paid, research made in psychology on how to get you as a client, you are being assaulted with much more thought out strategies than you imagine. The aim is consumerism, hedonism is good. At the end you are empty, sick, mentally and physically. 


// Tell story of Steve Jobs, how he most likely got pancreatic cancer in his youth from working at a factory, to solder electrical components. Then how it spread and how bad his treatment was(even recommended to eat meat by doctors) even though he was extremely rich.

One of the best ways to see unhealthy behaviour is to watch others. When we do it we give excuses, we are very understanding about our behaviour. But when it comes to others we are not as forgiving, "Why can't he get it together !" "Why can't he do his job properly".

// Scenario
All people are morons. Even if all people in the world had 150 IQ, they would still be morons. As a result of evolution the human brain sits on top of the animal brain(the limbic system(emotion and memory) and reptilian brain). If you learn from childhood something wrong but you believe it's right it's very, very hard to correct. Neurons that fire together wire together, your brain literally changes. Thats why it's easy to indoctrinate people when they are young. Once they have their world view established it's much harder. 

To acknowledge that a whole f p b diet is right it's extraordinary hard, considering the father of medicine himself, Hippocrates could not convince his fellow humans that plant based food is better than animal food. In his famous conversation with Gluttonius, Gluttonius said "Even if plants are healthier people want to eat meat.". He later became immortalized in Bible as one of the seven sins gluttony. Yes people want to eat meat but they should be aware of the danger. Whatever one choses in life he or she should be prepared for the possible negative consequences of that choice and face them with dignity and courage. When people get cancer I only saw whining, sadness, humiliation, misery, denial, overall the situation is pathetic. Especially when the treatment is more painful and humiliating than the disease itself and doctors are not trained.

In many things we fantasize how good it will be if we get that, do that, reach there, only to realize the reality is not that nice. Going with the ceremony of marriage won't just suddenly change you, taking vows, telling yourself from this moment on I'm different from before and things are going to be so good from now on is not true, it's delusion.

We do this when we expect a baby, oh my god we are going to have a baby it will be such joy from now on. It does not work that way. We fantasize but reality is not that good. We do this in many areas, we have high expectations and they fall short.

// Gluten sensitivity (from wheat rye and barley)

In recent years, the number of people affected by celiac disease, wheat allergy or gluten sensitivity has risen sharply. Some of the medical profession didn’t actually believe gluten sensitivity existed as these patients had normal test results and so it was only based on symptoms they reported. However is a new study published in July 2020 has disproved this theory.

Because the wheat we eat today is different that the ancient grains. It's been modified.

Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disease caused by a harmful immune response to gluten proteins in genetically susceptible individuals.

gluten may cause artritis, or Hashimoto's(immune system attack thyroid)

// 40% - 50% have various levels of gluten sensitivity because they have the HLA DQ2 AND DQ8 genes.
    Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 and HLA DQ8 are important risk factors for some autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease; however, their possible role in other diseases and health conditions is not fully explored.

// Gluten free grains
Quinoa, buckwheat, gluten free oats, amaranth, millet , teff, corn, sorghum, rice

// Watch the salt intake

// how willpower works
If you stuff that needs willpower you will consume your willpower so if you have other important things that need willpower well it's gonna be very hard to do them and most likely you will quit. Look at the spartans, they employed other people to do the chores around the house so they can focus on their training.

//
In a study willpower was revealed to be a feeling, sure a more lasting feeling than motivation but still a feeling. That means it may come and go.  Just use the path of least resistance.

*****************************************************************
// If you want to achieve things easily use the path of least resistance.
	
Path of least resistance.
	Change environment to easily do the things you should be doing and make it hard for the things you shouldn't be doing. 

*********************************************************
	For ex: a boy wanted to play guitar but he kept procrastinating. He took the batteries from the remote 
		and put them in a drawer in a different room. He could use the tv but he had to go get the batteries. 
	He took the guitar out of the closet, out of the case and put the guitar on a stand the he bought near the couch. So every time he rested on the couch the guitar was available not the remote control.

	For ex: boyfriend and girlfriend wanted to deepen the relationship so they decided at diner time they will have a meaningful conversation. Unfortunately they had Netflix so they canceled their Netflix subscription(you could simply move the TV in another room).

If you start doing something you are most likely to continue doing it. Use this to do something positive for at least 5 min, you will discover you will choose to continue doing it for much longer. For exercise just do a little and the mood to do more will come.


 Jocko Willink and David Goggins come from military backgrounds where only willpower and discipline can get you through the course. The path of least resistance doesn't work there because you can't change things. But in our everyday lives we can change our environment to make things that we should do easier and what we shouldn't harder.

Think about how each object affects your routine.￼

You have a phone or a computer, maybe install a program that helps you by blocking the bad things like facebook or whatnot and promote good things like opening word, excell or google docs automatically.

MSG is not proved to be unhealthy in normal or small doses.
Monosodium glutamate (MSG), also known as sodium glutamate, is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. MSG is found naturally in some foods including tomatoes and cheese.

The umami taste comes from the presence of the amino acid glutamate — or glutamic acid.

If you work out then be present. Live life in day to day compartments. Sure you need to plan, but don't let worries, rumination take over.

// Other than death all failure is psychological. Persevere, treat failure for what it is, a painful lesson. 
Keep learning, adapt, adjust thats how you will move forward.

// How to start
// Make training and nutrition a little easier by removing barriers. Training you can do at home, food unfortunately is up to you to cook it(you may buy a good blender, or food processor, or immersion blender ). 

Do just as much as you are willing to do. Expend only the amount of effort you are willing to give for the thing you want to achieve. That's how you start, do just a little bit. Then you work your way up to more.

If doing the little things is hard, imagine doing the things that lead up to the little thing, then imagine doing the little thing, then a bigger thing. 

Even with training, if you don't feel like it, just say "I'll do it for 5 mins, if I don't feel like it after 5 mins, that's it". What ends up happening after those 5 min you want to finish your scheduled training, just break the initial barrier.

Make things as easier as possible so you can start, then you can improve. Little by little you will get things done.

And if you do, reward yourself(even if it's just a few kind words, give yourself a pat on the back for the work you did). Don't expect kindness from others, don't expect to be praised for your achievements by others.

// I've noticed that there are people(like mother and father) looking for that one easy thing that will solve their problems. It does not work like that. When most of the food you eat is bad, then if you add one healthy thing you will not all of a sudden compensate for all the bad things you do to your body and become healthy. The sum of all the healthy food will have the effect you want but there is no miracle there.
Story: mother wants ground flax seed in her yogurt for "colon cleansing", when you eat processed food, animal products like meat, eggs and dairy the flax will not do much.

************** The bra story.
// Once I was at the store and saw this girl with her boyfriend. It was summer, she had some baggy clothes but as I passed by her something caught my eye, even though I was not focusing on her. As I did a double take I realized it was her back that draw my attention. It was like it was made from pudding, the straps of her bra were sinking into the back, she had fat even on her back. It really was weird because when you looked at her from a little farther away she looked like a young woman with relatively nice figure. But on closer inspection she had little muscle and fat was starting to pile up, this is bad. The people that still live a hunter gatherer style are all lean, with muscle. That's what you want. For this girl the future did not look well. If you don't care for your body, you may look fine when you are young because most of the damage is internal but as your metabolism slows down it will also show on the outside. A lot of times even then it's not to late to avoid nasty diseases of affluence like cancer, diabetes, cataracts, stroke, heart attack etc.

The thing is she looked fine, but on a closer inspection where she was supposed to have muscle she had fat, and she was young. What do you think will happen later in life. Society tells us it's our fault because you need to be in the gym 24/7, you are lazy and unfocused. 

Modern day feminists rage at pictures with fit female models that promote gym's and fitness products, and demand to be taken down(and succeeded by the way) because that kind of body is not achievable. Basically I'm fat and unattractive, I don't want to be reminded everyday by billboards, I want to be called beautiful and be treated as a princess.

Oh by the way modern day feminist managed to fire the girls that worked on race tracks and some that worked in fighting sports as eye candy. The funny thing was when the girls in question appeared on TV not knowing why they were fired, their opinion was not taken in consideration. I needed this explained by a woman because this did not look like friendly fire, it looked deliberate. So what happened was modern day feminists were jealous by the opportunities and attention pretty girls receive from men while they are ignored(because they are not pretty). So they needed a story to justify their evil intentions. The story goes like this "These women are being exploited by the patriarchy, by male pigs. So banning these kinds of jobs is righteous !". And they succeeded.

// 
There was a guy that worked in construction. One day he was taking a dump at the construction site, one of his coworkers banged at the door to hurry up he need to go too. Well he tried to squeeze it out, one of his arteries popped in his brain. After millions of years of evolution, we have arteries sufficiently strong to handle all kinds of activities, sports, weight lifting. How is it possible for people to have a stroke in mostly harmless situations, taking a walk, talking with someone, walking up a flight of stairs etc. It almost looks random and that it could happen to anybody but it's not true. Your circulatory system is damaged, and if you don't do something now, stoke and heart attacks follow. 

//
One of my judo colleagues thought soy milk makes male develop breasts, because it has estrogen. Yes soy has plant estrogen called phytoestrogen( check the name, I can't remember exactly ) not estrogen. It has different receptors in the body and makes our bones stronger. Soy is healthy as long that is not that genetically modified version(but that one is fed to farm animals, it's not sold for human consumption).

***** Productivity

// Focus on Only the Smallest Part of Your Work at a Time
An easy way to kill your focus is to see a goal for the big giant accomplishment that it is. Most goals will at least take a few weeks to months to accomplish, and knowing that can make it feel like it’ll take FOREVER to do.

This will cause you to do one of two things:

You become discouraged because the goal is too big; or
You fantasize about what it’ll feel like to achieve the goal
Either way is terrible for your focus and always a potential problem when focusing on the big picture or using visualization.

So what should you do? Focus on doing a very small, minimum amount of work instead.

Writing 200 words per day or writing a minimum of 2 sentences per day?

20 pushups per day or a minimum of 1 pushup per day?

The key here is to use minimums. Chances are you’ll push past them.

Eventually your minimum will increase, and you’ll slowly improve your ability to stay focused on the bigger tasks.

// Visualize Yourself Working

Skip What You Don’t Know
This is a tip I don’t see often enough, if you hit a snag in your work then come back to it later. Focus your attention on what you CAN do, keep working “mindlessly” at all costs. All this means is that you should focus on the easy parts first.

************
Visualize Yourself Working
A proper way of using visualization, and it’s by visualizing yourself actually WORKING (not as if you’ve succeeded already).

Champion runners use this technique to great effect, usually by working backwards. They imagine themselves winning at first, then they act out the whole process in reverse, feeling and visualizing each step all the way to the beginning.

A quicker and more relevant way to apply this would be to imagine yourself doing a small part of the task at hand.

For instance, if you need to practice your guitar but it’s all the way across the room (let’s assume maximum laziness for the sake of this example), what should you do?

First, imagine standing up (really, think of the sensation of getting up and then do it). If you really imagined it, visualized and felt the act of standing up, then acting on that feeling will be easy.

Then repeat the visualization process with each step till you have that guitar in hand and you’re playing it. The process of focusing so intently on each step distracts you from how much you don’t want to do something, and the visualizations “ready your body” for each step you need done.

All you need to do is apply this process to whatever it is you need to focus on, just start with the smallest motion you need to do.

************************************
// Manage Your Momentum
The thing is I tried training 3 days a week but I couldn't keep it up. I needed discipline to train 3 days a week but training every day was easier, because you build momentum.

Momentum is like a discipline lubricant‒it helps ease the process of sticking with goals. That’s why I think it’s important that we never take true breaks from our goals; we end up losing momentum and relying on discipline to get back on track (not an easy thing to do).

This means each and everyday we need to do something significant to further our goals (yes, even weekends and holidays). And when I say “significant,” I don’t necessarily mean a big task‒but rather, any task that brings us closer to our goals.

For instance, if your goal is to be a freelance writer, then write one single pitch on a weekend. If your goal is get healthy, then go for a short 5 minute walk even on Christmas day.

Nothing big, nothing crazy, only stuff that is significant enough to contribute to the success of your overall goal.

// You want to grow through hardship not hedonism. Neurons that fire together wire together. I always liked the idea of training, because you grow into someone. Hedonism just fucks you up.

	Cookie jar - where you keep your good, inspiring memories. When life gets hard you open the cookie jar 
and take from there. You remember, yeah I did all those things, I achieved those. Memories used to fuel your progress when you are down.

	Fuck jar - stuff that you are scared of, disgusted etc. There is stuff there that will 
fuck you up. Fuck jar and taking souls go together you turn toward what you are afraid and face it. Because you can take it.

	Taking souls - "Give me your best shot, I can take it" When others compare themselves with you they 
remember I was fucked up at this part, why is this motherfucker so energetic and so happy. The story where they were tired and they had to lift a boat over their head and they were singing and doing presses with the boat above their head. So that instructors will look at him and his team and compare themselves with how they were when they took the course. They were not singing and doing presses with the boat that's for sure.
	
	Taking souls inspired by first rocky movie, where rocky is down and beaten to a pulp but he still gets 
up, in the meantime Apollo is with his hands up celebrating but as he turns around  he sees Rocky getting up. Rocky motions to Apollo "Come on!" and Apollo looks a bit away then at Rocky, he can't believe it, you can see it in his expression. He thought he beat him but there he stands, motioning to Apollo "Come on".

Thought and character are one, and as character can only manifest and discover itself through environment and circumstance, the outer conditions of a person's life will always be found to be harmoniously related to his inner state. This does not mean that a man's circumstances at any given time are an indication of his entire character, but that those circumstances are so intimately connected with some vital thought-element within himself that, for the time being, they are indispensable to his development.

*****************************
That's why we train, to create a safe environment where we can put pressure to reveal our character. Real hardship in life reveals character but it can be too much all at once and it can mess you up for life or kill you. There is war, disease, hunger, poverty this can break you but with training you can chose the intensity of hardship so you don't get too much all at once and progress.

// The three secrets of resilient people
1 Be kind to yourself.

2 Focus on the positive(the good) or else your stress response will only get higher and higher.
As an exercise think(hunt) of three good things that happened to you to be grateful.

3 Ask a question: Is what I'm doing helping or harming me ?

****************************************
This is a very versatile question you can apply it to many situations, for ex:

Are my thoughts helping or harming me ? If they harm you, then drop them.
Is hanging around, talking with this person hinder my progress in life ? Yes ? Drop them.

// How to restore balance

Once we understand the difference between SNS and PSNS we can actively try to stimulate our PSNS. Coach Chrissy Zmijewski recommends activating our PSNS to decrease recovery time after exercise. Here are 7 fixes to restore the balance between your SNS and PSNS.

Reduce Stress
Stress is ubiquitous. Good health depends on removing or reducing whatever stressors we can control, and reduce our reactions to those we can’t.

Meditation
We can’t remove all external stress. Meditation is the best way to decrease our reactivity to stress we can’t control. It teaches us to ignore triggers. It reduces our breathing, slows our heart, and decreases our blood pressure: all signs of PSNS activation. Meditations reduces lactic acid in our muscles, promoting recovery.

Massage
Regular massage has been shown to restore balance between SNS and PSNS. Massage makes us stronger, calmer, and more able to fight infection. By activating the PSNS, massage promotes recovery. It retrains the body to move more readily into PSNS even when we’re stressed.

Breathing
Breathing straddles the peripheral nervous system and the autonomic system. It happens automatically but we can also control it. We can hold our breath for example, but we cannot stop our heart. Slowed breathing is a hallmark of PSNS. But it’s not just a symptom, it’s a signal. Slowing your breathing intentionally tells your SNS than things are okay. This activates the PSNS.

Daily breathing exercises will strengthen your lungs, improve your immune system, and decrease your resting heart rate. Here’s a simple way to activate your PSNS. Inhale for a count of 2. Hold that breathe for a count of 5. Exhale for a count of 7. Repeat.

Yoga/ instead try Tai Chi
Like meditation, yoga will bring you into PSNS, It also bolsters your ability to decrease SNS activation when you are stressed.

Daily or weekly yoga classes, or even a quick yoga video at home, will improve your strength, flexibility and breathing.

Nutrition
Can what you eat affect your SNS/PSNS balance? Yes. Avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and sugar will facilitate PSNS. An anti-stress diet brings the right mix of protein, minerals and other nutrients to support PSNS.

Exercise
Yes, intense exercise, even the idea of it, stimulates our SNS. But regular aerobic exercise such as light jogging can actually decrease SNS activity and activate our PSNS. The key is moderation and measurement.

***********************************************************
// habits of original thinkers

Original thinkers are the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels. The ones who see things differently. The people that are not only new ideas but people that champion them and take action.

It's okay to procrastinate for a mediocre amount of time when you have an objective. While you pause the mind will work in the background trying to make connections and offer a solution. That's why when you ruminate on a problem it's good to take a break and then do something else. A solution will pop up eventually by its self or when you start working fresh on the problem.

People are more creative and innovative when they procrastinate moderately, that's where original thinkers are.

By delaying the task we let ourselves open to ideas. And if many things are not set in stone we have freedom to improvise.

Originals are the improvers 

Originals are quick to start slow to finish. They are the improvers. First on the market does not mean success, when someone does the same thing but much better, first on the market loses unless they adapt. First movers that created the market have about 47% change of failure, the improvers have 8%. 

**********
It's much easier to improve on someones idea then to improve from scratch. To be original you don't have to be first, just different and better.

The creative process for normal humans.

1 This is awesome.
2 This is tricky.

3 This is crap.
4 I am crap.

5 This might be okay.
6 This is awesome.

The key is to avoid the leap from Step 3 to Step 4. Instead of saying I'm crap, you have to remember the first drafts are always crap, this is NORMAL, I'm not just there yet.

Hold onto the doubt.
You want to be the kind of person who doubts the default and looks for a better option. The opposite of deja vs is vuja de. It means you are looking at something seen many times but all of sudden you see it with fresh eyes. Like Frozen, in every iteration the queen was always the antagonist, but the writer did not feel it was right, she doubted if ti made sense. She changed the first act, she reinvented the queen at the beginning as a tortured hero and Frozen became the most successful animated movie. 

When you feel doubt don't let it go.

Originals are fearful too. They fear to try, because you can fail. But they know that in the long run the biggest regrets are the chances not taken not the failure. Not the actions but our inactions. What could have been if we tried.

You have to have things that are too important not to try.

You are not going to be judged for your bad ideas. A lot of people don't speak up for fear of embarrassment.
Originals have lots of bad ideas. The greatest originals are the ones that fail the most because they try the most.

The more you try the more you can hone onto your greatest works. You learn and adapt.
You need to try a lot, to become better.

//
Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.

The more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself


// When you eat to much on whole food plant based diet in general your body just burns the extra calories, you don't have to count your calories you won't get fat. Unless you eat a lot of fatty foods like avocado and nuts. Nuts should be used as a snack.

// How Meat & Dairy Cause Leptin Resistance
Leptin is hormone released by fat cells, reaches brain and signals to lose your appetite you have enough.
Leptin resistance is brain damage(to hypothalamus) caused by saturated fat intake from animal products meat, dairy and processed junk. You eat wrong food, causes inflammation in brain in the part that regulates it, your brain doesn't listen to leptin anymore so you get fatter and fatter.

// nudging and nagging
	Nudging is good when you have problems with starting things, but nagging creates negative feeling, people 
		don't do well on negative feelings. 
	
	There is a high chance of suicide/attempted suicide among recruits when instructors and other recruits 
		are too harsh.

	You have to talk, communicate to see if you benefit from nudging, who does the nudging, how is it done.

	Obviously children need to be supervised by adults.
	Because children are so simple minded, they often don’t respect any boundaries. Children can easily cross lines that shouldn’t be crossed. Children are closer to the animal side and they can be cruel, the black sheep case easily can happen.

	People don't kick a dead dog. If you get attacked that means people consider you an obstacle for some reason.

// Light box tips
lampi cu lumina diurna, 
lampi care simuleaza lumina solara naturala

It’s also helpful to keep in mind that some fluorescent lights flicker, causing potential eyestrain and headache. I recommend looking for a box that uses flicker-free technology. (One adjustable, flicker-free light box that my patients rave about is the Day-Light DL930 by Uplift Technologies, which at the time of this writing is available from Amazon.com for less than $150.)
 

Light box tips. Here are a few additional points to keep in mind for getting the most out of your light box:

• It’s best if you can set the box up about six inches or so above eye level.
• If possible, position the box so it’s centered in front of you, not off to one side.
• Light boxes usually work best when they’re positioned about eighteen to twenty-four inches from your eyes. But there’s an interesting tradeoff when it comes to distance. The farther away the box is, the more it will reach every part of your eyes (a good thing) but the lower the number of lux it will deliver (not so good). Most high-quality boxes can deliver 10,000 lux at a distance of at least eighteen inches, but some boxes need to be a bit closer. (The product insert will tell you just how close you need to be to receive 10,000 lux.) However, positioning the box any closer than twelve inches can cause uncomfortable eyestrain.

• Never stare directly at the box itself. It will be far too bright, and very hard on the eyes. Instead, fix your gaze on something in front of you—a computer screen, a book, a newspaper, a conversation partner—with the light shining down into your eyes from above.
• If you can’t position the box above you for some reason, it will still work okay if you locate it slightly off to your side—as long as it’s still facing you from the front. But make sure to keep things balanced by switching sides (from your left to right or vice versa) halfway through the exposure period.
 

// 3 things that make work satisfying
Autonomy
How much control you have over your time and actions.

Competence 
The feeling that you are skilled in your work(non trivial work, and it's a skill worth having) 

Relatedness
Your connection with other people. Do you feel loved, respected, do you feel that you are integral(important, necessary) part of your group. Both with coworkers and personal relationships.

"Our job is to find a few intelligent things to do, not keep up with every damn thing in the world."

"The Internet makes us vastly overvalue what happens to us right now. Our bias towards novelty(social media, Youtube, etc) forces us towards the trivial rather than essential." 

No matter what amount of work anyone does people will hold different opinions. To recognize the limits of your knowledge and to appreciate others intellectual strengths is one of the best things a person can do.

It seems to be in our nature to focus on how we were wrong over the fact that we're now smarter(as if we can't be works in progress), and we often attach our egos to what we believe. A view is just how you see something. It doesn't have to define you, and trying to detach from it to gain understanding can be a very good thing. 

// Think about the smallest thing you are willing to do for the thing you pursue and do it.


// Authenticity
// When talking to people you must create a safe space by being authentic with empathy, a space where you don't JUDGE or criticize but listen.
	We can't be fully authentic, raw honesty can lead to nasty situations. For example leaders that were 
exposing who they really were and dealt with employees with brutal honesty, criticism, micromanagement even shouting, red pen over the memo, ignoring your messages and mails sitting behind computers when you are talking. These were ways of being brutal in feedback to your team members. So if thats being you, you are killing the team motivation(remember these people believe it's not them it's the team), you are killing their trust in you and their cooperation. You should be authentic with empathy. 
	This was the advice for these leaders:
	
	1. Know your role and stay in the boundaries of that. You are the leader, not their friend, you are not there to criticize or punish.
	It's important that you are clear about your expectations, and communicate to the others these expectations and the boundaries of these expectations.

	2. Be prepared and do the research to know more about the team members, to understand what drives them, motivates them, what makes them work in this company or with you.

	3. Remain curious even when they felt challenged. Because they said they had people who were incompetent or resistant to challenge or pushing back on their agenda, or they just didn't like certain members of their team. Remain curious rather than judgmental or critical.

Being authentic is not being brutal or careless. You can be authentic with empathy. Authenticity comes in many forms. We can soften our interactions to enable smother work flow. Brutal honesty kills conversations, connections, kills motivation, kills trust. Being authentic encourages conversations, motivation, builds trust.

// Habit
Trigger -> Pattern(stuff you do) that leads to -> reward

When procrastinating stress is the trigger, you can't get rid of stress
1 acknowledge the stress
2 count 5 4 3 2 1
3 Interrupt procrastination habit
4 Do 1 thing, work for at least 5 min. The problem is not working it's the habit of avoiding. If you start 80% are going to keep going.

// working memory
Between endless input and long term memory lies working memory.
	Working memory can hold about 2-4 things but we have to work on them, rehearse them, we have to ponder 
on them for a while to stay in working memory and then they will enter long term memory.
	Constant assault of new information, distractions, multitasking prevents this data to enter in memory, 
the data does not stay in working memory long enough. So we trick ourselves into thinking that we understand something only to realize we can't explain explain it.

3 methods to commit things to long memory

1 Recall 
	After reading look away and try to recall what your read, repeat the process. Even recalling for 30 
	seconds the key points of what you read vastly improves the things you commit in memory.
2 Feynman technique
	1. Take something you want to understand
	2. Write out an explanation as if you were teaching it to someone who didn't understand the subject.
	3. Whenever you get stuck, go back to the material and re-learn. Fill in the gaps in your knowledge until you can write an explanation without source material.
	4. Simplify(Get rid of technical/convoluted language) use analogies

3 Spaced repetition
	Neurons that fire together, wire together. The brain like a muscle needs to be exercised. The more you use the neurons that work when you grapple with the concept you want in memory the stronger those connection will get and the stronger your memory and understanding of that information will get.

// planning
Gabriele Oettingen has done a lot of research into the best type of plans. She found that ‘plans’ that are simply positive fantasies can actually be bad for trying to achieve goals. An example fantasy would be ‘I would love to get that job when I quit my job next week.’

She found that these fantasies aren’t enough, and that a key component for successful planning is thinking about the obstacles that might get in the way of achieving what you want. Identifying what stands between you and fulfilling your goal can make you more committed to carrying out your plan and allow you to deal with each obstacle when it pops up.

Oettingen coined the term ‘Mental Contrasting’ for this. You should contrast the fantasies you have with the realistic obstacles that stand in your way. Doing this brings you back down to earth and calls you to act so you can overcome specific hurdles. An example would be ‘I would love to get that job when I quit my job next week, but my CV is not up-to-date yet.’

Breaking down complex plans into simpler ones
Identifying the obstacles that can stand in our way goes a long way to helping us to stick to our plans. However, when these obstacles are complicated or tempting it can be hard to see a simple way to overcome them.

One way to make this easier could be to use Implementation Intentions, or ‘If-Then’ plans. These are plans where you state that ‘if’ something happens, ‘then’ you will do carry out a certain behavior. For example: If I see a tempting unhealthy snack, then I will eat an apple instead.

When people encounter problems in translating their goals into action (e.g., failing to get started, becoming distracted, or falling into bad habits), they may strategically call on automatic processes in an attempt to secure goal attainment. This can be achieved by plans in the form of implementation intentions that link anticipated critical situations to goal-directed responses ("Whenever situation x arises, I will initiate the goal-directed response y!"). Implementation intentions delegate the control of goal-directed responses to anticipated situational cues, which (when actually encountered) elicit these responses automatically. A program of research demonstrates that implementation intentions further the attainment of goals, and it reveals the underlying processes.

// Self worth theory
We need to be seen as capable, able and competent. It's a primary need, so, we will sacrifice other needs in exchange, that's were procrastination comes in.

Simple model about peoples beliefs on performance, ability and self worth.
          Ability -> Performance level -> Sense of Worth

                           ^
                           |
                         Effort

People afraid of failure have an equation:
Performance = Ability = Worth (Self worth as a human being)    

We have two opposing forces Drive to succeed but great fear of failure. Fear of failure makes us do less, doing less means less training.

Then after we delay by doing other nonessential things we say if I don't start now I won't get this done. We 

self sabotage -> performance sabotage	

for self-protection. The fear of not getting done exceeds the need to do things less than perfectly. It's not just self sabotage is protection because of our need to be seen as able, capable, competent and worthy human. Self worth is very important.

When we fail because we procrastinate, we tell ourselves we failed because we only had two hours to finish the paper. How could we have done it in 2 hours, we created the excuse not only for us but to tell others too. When we failed we told everyone that we didn't have time not because we are stupid or incompetent. It's a good strategy if we get good grade "Oh, I'm smarter than I thought."

Procrastination is very good in protecting our self worth even if we jeopardize our performance. We increase the chance we need the excuse.

When things are bad we scare ourselves with if I don't do this I won't get in med school etc. This makes us fearful, not the best strategy.


Strategies for procrastination.
1 Develop awareness about what you feel and think, so you can actively chose what to feel and think and what we are motivated by.

2 Tip the balance toward Approach Motives rather than Avoidance Motives 
Approach motive make you feel good, feeling good makes you move forward more easily

Example from the one who did the Ted Talk, he wrote this things on a small paper
	* View as opportunity to experiment (this lowers the stakes of failure)

3 The last way to tackle procrastination
P != A != W

Our performance does not equal ability always and ability does not mean worth entirely. Our worth is from human qualities, kindness, thoughtfulness and vulnerabilities.

May your choices reflect your hopes not your fears.

// increase productivity by turning life into a game
jOUrnal keep track of progress , nutrition path, programming, exercise/med

try to reward yourself with rewards that reward you back, buy stuff that gives you back money, better running shoes if you run etc 

Add variety and novelty, incorporate something new to avoid bordnes, a challenge, look for way to make things slightly different

A game keeps challenging you by increasing difficulty, variety . The challenge is neither too hard nor too easy. In real life try to break down big task. If you have small things to do increase difficulty by adding a time frame.

A game may provide a sense of community and competition, autonomy and sense of control

7 qualities that make job satisfying

1 Are you building or maintaining(if you maintain stuff too long you get bored)

2 Are you using your current skills or are you learning new ones ?

3 How much creative autonomy you have

4 Interactions with others(what kind of interactions and with whom)

5 Level of authority over other people
Do you want to manage or do your own work. The ones that want to do their own work delegate so that they can focus on creation.

6 Do you like being in the spotlight ? Do you want to be the person who wants the attention and glory for something or do you like to be behind the scenes. Do you want credit or you don't care that much.
If you do like the spotlight, keep your ego in check. Your self worth is not defined by how much applause you get from other people. Make time to acknowledge the work of others and raise people up.

//****************
7 Work life balance 
How much you prioritize work life over personal life. How much time you have for relationships, friends, family, where do you live and how long is the commute. Do you get to travel or you don't care about that.
Can you shut off after work or you are expected to always be on call(This is the thing with programming, even after the work hours are done you still have to learn to keep yourself relevant).


Simply pursue your interests and work hard at doing that because we can't pick our passion. We don't know what traits or qualities of work resonate with us until we experience it. 

While getting that experience BE OBSERVANT even keep a journal and compare your work with this qualities.

// Scenario for the client, leave it on the desk
Make a scenario, the client is tasked by a king to provide a healthy diet for the nation and to popularize the diet the king will follow it as well. If you succeed you will be rewarded handsomely but if you fail you are dead. The king doesn't want to be lied, and other are aiming for you place. 

How will you convince the king your diet is the best.

How will you achieve this when failure will cost your life.
Ask how will you convince the king when others want to disprove your arguments at every turn, how will you prove your diet is best. How will you respond to the competition. The client will learn about nutrition and realize how hard is to change someones view.
What if the king tests your diet vs your competitors diet.

How will the client convince the king of the best diet.

// How to convince the client to convince himself using his words to implement your idea.
Besides saying “No,” the other key benefit of asking “How?” is, quite literally, that it forces your counterpart to consider and explain how a deal will be implemented. A deal is nothing without good 
implementation. Poor implementation is the cancer that eats your profits.

By making your counterparts articulate implementation in their own words, your carefully calibrated “How” questions will convince them that the final solution is their idea. And that’s crucial. People always make more effort to implement a solution when they think it’s theirs. That is simply human nature. That’s why negotiation is often called “the art of letting someone else have your way.”

There are two key questions you can ask to push your counterparts to think they are defining success their way: “How will we know we’re on track?” and “How will we address things if we find we’re off track?” When they answer, you summarize their answers until you get a “That’s right.” Then you’ll know they’ve bought in.

On the flip side, be wary of two telling signs that your counterpart doesn’t believe the idea is theirs. As I’ve noted, when they say, “You’re right,” it’s often a good indicator they are not vested in what is being discussed. And when you push for implementation and they say, “I’ll try,” you should get a sinking feeling in your stomach. Because this really means, “I plan to fail.”

When you hear either of these, dive back in with calibrated “How” questions until they define the terms of successful implementation in their own voice. Follow up by summarizing what they have said to get a “That’s right.”

Let the other side feel victory. Let them think it was their idea. Subsume your ego. Remember: “Yes” is nothing without “How.” So keep asking “How?” And succeed.

Yes, few hostage-takers—and few business deal makers—fly solo. But for the most part, there are almost always other players, people who can act as deal makers or deal killers. If you truly want to get to “Yes” and get your deal implemented, you have to discover how to affect these individuals.

When implementation happens by committee, the support of that committee is key. You always have to identify and unearth their motivations, even if you haven’t yet identified each individual on that committee. That can be easy as asking a few calibrated questions, like “How does this affect the rest of your team?” or “How on board are the people not on this call?” or simply “What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?”

The larger concept I’m explaining here is that in any negotiation you have to analyze the entire negotiation space.

When other people will be affected by what is negotiated and can assert their rights or power later on, it’s just stupid to consider only the interests of those at the negotiation table. You have to beware of “behind the table” or “Level II” players—that is, parties that are not directly involved but who can help implement agreements they like and block ones they don’t. You can’t disregard them even when you’re talking to a CEO. There could always be someone whispering into his ear. At the end of the day, the deal killers often are more important than the deal makers.

Think back to the prison siege: it was almost ruined because one bit player on our side was not totally on board. That’s what our use of calibrated questions in Ecuador avoided, and that’s why José’s case was a home run.

It only takes one bit player to screw up a deal.

A few years into private practice I’d lost sight of the importance of assessing and influencing the hidden negotiation that happens “behind the table,” and I paid a substantial price.

We were closing a deal with a big company in Florida that wanted negotiation training for one of its divisions. We’d been on the phone a bunch of times with the CEO and the head of HR, and they were both 100 percent gung ho on our offering. We were elated—we had what we thought was total buy-in from the top decision makers for an incredibly lucrative deal.

And then, as we were figuring out the small print, the deal fell off the table.

It turns out that the head of the division that needed the training killed the deal. Maybe this guy felt threatened, slighted, or otherwise somehow personally injured by the notion that he and his people “needed” any training at all. (A surprisingly high percentage of negotiations hinge on something outside dollars and cents, often having more to do with self-esteem, status, and other nonfinancial needs.) We’ll never know now.

The point is, we didn’t care until too late because we convinced ourselves that we were on the phone with the only decision makers that mattered.

We could have avoided all that had we asked a few calibrated questions, like: How does this affect everybody else? How on board is the rest of your team? How do we make sure that we deliver the right material to the right people? How do we ensure the managers of those we’re training are fully on board?

If we had asked questions like that, the CEO and HR head would have checked with this guy, maybe even brought him into the conversation. And saved us all a lot of pain.


// NO NEEDINESS: HAVING THE READY-TO-WALK MINDSET

We’ve said previously that no deal is better than a bad deal. If you feel you can’t say “No” then you’ve taken yourself hostage.

Once you’re clear on what your bottom line is, you have to be willing to walk away. Never be needy for a deal.

Before we move on, I want to emphasize how important it is to maintain a collaborative relationship even when you’re setting boundaries. Your response must always be expressed in the form of strong, yet empathic, limit-setting boundaries—that is, tough love—not as hatred or violence. Anger and other strong emotions can on rare occasions be effective. But only as calculated acts, never a personal attack. In any bare-knuckle bargaining session, the most vital principle to keep in mind is never to look at your counterpart as an enemy.

The person across the table is never the problem. The unsolved issue is. So focus on the issue. This is one of the most basic tactics for avoiding emotional escalations. Our culture demonizes people in movies and politics, which creates the mentality that if we only got rid of the person then everything would be okay. But this dynamic is toxic to any negotiation.

Punching back is a last resort. Before you go there, I always suggest an attempt at de-escalating the situation. Suggest a time-out. When your counterparts step back and take a breath, they’ll no longer feel that they are hostage to a bad situation. They’ll regain a sense of agency and power. And they’ll appreciate you for that.

Think of punching back and boundary-setting tactics as a flattened S-curve: you’ve accelerated up the slope of a negotiation and hit a plateau that requires you to temporarily stop any progress, escalate or de-escalate the issue acting as the obstacle, and eventually bring the relationship back to a state of rapport and get back on the slope. Taking a positive, constructive approach to conflict involves understanding that the bond is fundamental to any resolution. Never create an enemy.

//
It is the person best able to unearth, adapt to, and exploit the unknowns that will come out on top.

To uncover these unknowns, we must interrogate our world, must put out a call, and intensely listen to the response. Ask lots of questions. Read nonverbal clues and always voice your observations with your counterpart.

This is nothing beyond what you’ve been learning up to now. It is merely more intense and intuitive. You have to feel for the truth behind the camouflage; you have to note the small pauses that suggest discomfort and lies. Don’t look to verify what you expect. If you do, that’s what you’ll find. Instead, you must open yourself up to the factual reality that is in front of you.


// Paradox of power
But we couldn’t hit on that at all; we couldn’t threaten to kill him and expect that to work. The reason for that is something called the “paradox of power”—namely, the harder we push the more likely we are to be met with resistance. That’s why you have to use negative leverage sparingly.


// MISTAKE #1: THEY ARE ILL-INFORMED

Often the other side is acting on bad information, and when people have bad information they make bad choices. There’s a great computer industry term for this: GIGO—Garbage In, Garbage Out.

As an example, Malhotra talks about a student of his who was in a dispute with an ex-employee who claimed he was owed $130,000 in commissions for work he had done before being fired; he was threatening a lawsuit.

Confused, the executive turned to the company’s accountants. There he discovered the problem: the accounts had been a mess when the employee was fired but had since been put into order. With the clean information, the accountants assured the executive that in fact the employee owed the company $25,000.

Eager to avoid a lawsuit, the executive called the employee, explained the situation, and made an offer: if the employee dropped the lawsuit he could keep the $25,000. To his surprise, the employee said that he was going forward with the suit anyway; he acted irrational, crazy.

Malhotra told his student that the problem was not craziness, but a lack of information and trust. So the executive had an outside accounting firm audit the numbers and send the results to the employee.

The result? The employee dropped the suit.

The clear point here is that people operating with incomplete information appear crazy to those who have different information. Your job when faced with someone like this in a negotiation is to discover what they do not know and supply that information.


//********************
OVERCOMING FEAR AND LEARNING TO GET WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE

People generally fear conflict, so they avoid useful arguments out of fear that the tone will escalate into personal attacks they cannot handle. People in close relationships often avoid making their own interests known and instead compromise across the board to avoid being perceived as greedy or self-interested. They fold, they grow bitter, and they grow apart. We’ve all heard of marriages that ended in divorce and the couple never fought.

Families are just an extreme version of all parts of humanity, from government to business. Except for a few naturals, everyone hates negotiation at first. Your hands sweat, your fight-or-flight kicks in (with a strong emphasis on flight), and your thoughts trip drunkenly over themselves.

The natural first impulse for most of us is to chicken out, throw in the towel, run. The mere idea of tossing out an extreme anchor is traumatic. That’s why wimp-win deals are the norm in the kitchen and in the boardroom.

But stop and think about that. Are we really afraid of the guy across the table? I can promise you that, with very few exceptions, he’s not going to reach across and slug you.

No, our sweaty palms are just an expression of physiological fear, a few trigger-happy neurons firing because of something more base: our innate human desire to get along with other members of the tribe. It’s not the guy across the table who scares us: it’s conflict itself.

If this book accomplishes only one thing, I hope it gets you over that fear of conflict and encourages you to navigate it with empathy. If you’re going to be great at anything—a great negotiator, a great manager, a great husband, a great wife—you’re going to have to do that. You’re going to have to ignore that little genie who’s telling you to give up, to just get along—as well as that other genie who’s telling you to lash out and yell.

You’re going to have to embrace regular, thoughtful conflict as the basis of effective negotiation—and of life. Please remember that our emphasis throughout the book is that the adversary is the situation and that the person that you appear to be in conflict with is actually your partner.

More than a little research has shown that genuine, honest conflict between people over their goals actually helps energize the problem-solving process in a collaborative way. Skilled negotiators have a talent for using conflict to keep the negotiation going without stumbling into a personal battle.

Remember, pushing hard for what you believe is not selfish. It is not bullying. It is not just helping you. Your amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear, will try to convince you to give up, to flee, because the other guy is right, or you’re being cruel.

But if you are an honest, decent person looking for a reasonable outcome, you can ignore the amygdala.

With the style of negotiation taught in the book—an information-obsessed, empathic search for the best possible deal—you are trying to uncover value, period. Not to strong-arm or to humiliate.

When you ask calibrated questions, yes, you are leading your counterpart to your goals. But you are also leading them to examine and articulate what they want and why and how they can achieve it. You are demanding creativity of them, and therefore pushing them toward a collaborative solution.

When I bought my red 4Runner, no doubt I disappointed the salesman by giving him a smaller payday than he would have liked. But I helped him reach his quota, and no doubt I paid more for the truck than the car lot had paid Toyota. If all I’d wanted was to “win,” to humiliate, I would have stolen the thing.

And so I’m going to leave you with one request: Whether it’s in the office or around the family dinner table, don’t avoid honest, clear conflict. It will get you the best car price, the higher salary, and the largest donation. It will also save your marriage, your friendship, and your family.

One can only be an exceptional negotiator, and a great person, by both listening and speaking clearly and empathetically; by treating counterparts—and oneself—with dignity and respect; and most of all by being honest about what one wants and what one can—and cannot—do. Every negotiation, every conversation, every moment of life, is a series of small conflicts that, managed well, can rise to creative beauty.

Embrace them.

// KEY LESSONS

What we don’t know can kill us or our deals. But uncovering it can totally change the course of a negotiation and bring us unexpected success.

Finding the Black Swans—those powerful unknown unknowns—is intrinsically difficult, however, for the simple reason that we don’t know the questions to ask. Because we don’t know what the treasure is, we don’t know where to dig.

Here are some of the best techniques for flushing out the Black Swans—and exploiting them. Remember, your counterpart might not even know how important the information is, or even that they shouldn’t reveal it. So keep pushing, probing, and gathering information.

■Let what you know—your known knowns—guide you but not blind you. Every case is new, so remain flexible and adaptable. Remember the Griffin bank crisis: no hostage-taker had killed a hostage on deadline, until he did.

■Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of leverage: positive (the ability to give someone what they want); negative (the ability to hurt someone); and normative (using your counterpart’s norms to bring them around).

■Work to understand the other side’s “religion.” Digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart. That’s where Black Swans live.

■Review everything you hear from your counterpart. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with team members. Use backup listeners whose job is to listen between the lines. They will hear things you miss.

■Exploit the similarity principle. People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with, so dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground.

■When someone seems irrational or crazy, they most likely aren’t. Faced with this situation, search for constraints, hidden desires, and bad information.

■Get face time with your counterpart. Ten minutes of face time often reveals more than days of research. Pay special attention to your counterpart’s verbal and nonverbal communication at unguarded moments—at the beginning and the end of the session or when someone says something out of line.


PREPARE A NEGOTIATION ONE SHEET
Negotiation is a psychological investigation. You can gain a measure of confidence going into such an investigation with a simple preparatory exercise we advise all our clients to do. Basically, it’s a list of the primary tools you anticipate using, such as labels and calibrated questions, customized to the particular negotiation.

When the pressure is on, you don’t rise to the occasion—you fall to your highest level of preparation.

One note of caution before going into greater depth on this exercise: some negotiation experts fetishize preparation to such a degree that they advise people to create the equivalent of preordained scripts for exactly how the negotiation will unfold and the exact form and substance the agreement will take on. By now, after reading this far, you’ll understand why that’s a fool’s errand. Not only will such an approach make you less agile and creative at the table, it will make you more susceptible to those who are.

Based on my company’s experiences, I believe that good initial preparation for each negotiation yields at least a 7:1 rate of return on time saved renegotiating deals or clarifying implementation.

In the entertainment industry, they have a single document that summarizes a product for publicity and sales that they call a “one sheet.” Along the same lines, we want to produce a negotiation “one sheet” that summarizes the tools we are going to use.

It will have five short sections

SECTION I: THE GOAL

Think through best/worst-case scenarios but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case.

Typically, negotiation experts will tell you to prepare by making a list: your bottom line; what you really want; how you’re going to try to get there; and counters to your counterpart’s arguments.

But this typical preparation fails in many ways. It’s unimaginative and leads to the predictable bargaining dynamic of offer/counteroffer/meet in the middle. In other words, it gets results, but they’re often mediocre.

The centerpiece of the traditional preparation dynamic—and its greatest Achilles’ heel—is something called the BATNA.

Roger Fisher and William Ury coined the term in their 1981 bestseller, Getting to Yes, and it stands for Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. Basically, it’s the best possible option you have if negotiations fail. Your last resort. Say you’re on a car lot trying to sell your old BMW 3-series. If you already have another dealer who’s given you a written offer for $10,000, that’s your BATNA.

The problem is that BATNA tricks negotiators into aiming low. Researchers have found that humans have a limited capacity for keeping focus in complex, stressful situations like negotiations. And so, once a negotiation is under way, we tend to gravitate toward the focus point that has the most psychological significance for us.

In that context, obsessing over a BATNA turns it into your target, and thereby sets the upper limit of what you will ask for. After you’ve spent hours on a BATNA, you mentally concede everything beyond it.

God knows aiming low is seductive. Self-esteem is a huge factor in negotiation, and many people set modest goals to protect it. It’s easier to claim victory when you aim low. That’s why some negotiation experts say that many people who think they have “win-win” goals really have a “wimp-win” mentality. The “wimp-win” negotiator focuses on his or her bottom line, and that’s where they end up.

So if BATNA isn’t your centerpiece, what should be?

I tell my clients that as part of their preparation they should think about the outcome extremes: best and worst. If you’ve got both ends covered, you’ll be ready for anything. So know what you cannot accept and have an idea about the best-case outcome, but keep in mind that since there’s information yet to be acquired from the other side, it’s quite possible that best case might be even better than you know.

Remember, never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn’t take something better. Once you’ve got flexibility in the forefront of your mind you come into a negotiation with a winning mindset.

Let’s say you’re selling old speakers because you need $100 to put toward a new set. If you concentrate on the $100 minimum, you’ll relax when you hear that number and that’s what you’ll get. But if you know that they are for sale in used audio stores for $140, you could set a high-end goal of $150, while remaining open to better things.

Now, while I counsel thinking about a best/worst range to give my clients the security of some structure, when it comes to what actually goes on your one sheet, my advice is to just stick with the 
high-end goal, as it will motivate and focus your psychological powers, priming you to think you are facing a “loss” for any term that falls short. Decades of goal-setting research is clear that people who set specific, challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals than those who don’t set goals or simply strive to do their best.

Bottom line: People who expect more (and articulate it) get more.

Here are the four steps for setting your goal:

■Set an optimistic but reasonable goal and define it clearly.

■Write it down.

■Discuss your goal with a colleague (this makes it harder to wimp out).

■Carry the written goal into the negotiation.

SECTION II: SUMMARY

Summarize and write out in just a couple of sentences the known facts that have led up to the negotiation.

You’re going to have to have something to talk about beyond a self-serving assessment of what you want. And you had better be ready to respond with tactical empathy to your counterpart’s arguments; unless they’re incompetent, the other party will come prepared to argue an interpretation of the facts that favors them.

Get on the same page at the outset.

You have to clearly describe the lay of the land before you can think about acting in its confines. Why are you there? What do you want? What do they want? Why?

You must be able to summarize a situation in a way that your counterpart will respond with a “That’s right.” If they don’t, you haven’t done it right.

SECTION III: LABELS/ACCUSATION AUDIT

Prepare three to five labels to perform an accusation audit.

Anticipate how your counterpart feels about these facts you’ve just summarized. Make a concise list of any accusations they might make—no matter how unfair or ridiculous they might be. Then turn each accusation into a list of no more than five labels and spend a little time role-playing it.

There are fill-in-the-blank labels that can be used in nearly every situation to extract information from your counterpart, or defuse an accusation:

It seems like _________ is valuable to you.

It seems like you don’t like _________.

It seems like you value __________.

It seems like _________ makes it easier.

It seems like you’re reluctant to _________.

As an example, if you’re trying to renegotiate an apartment lease to allow subletters and you know the landlord is opposed to them, your prepared labels would be on the lines of “It seems as though you’re not a fan of subletters” or “It seems like you want stability with your tenants.”

SECTION IV: CALIBRATED QUESTIONS

Prepare three to five calibrated questions to reveal value to you and your counterpart and identify and overcome potential deal killers.

Effective negotiators look past their counterparts’ stated positions (what the party demands) and delve into their underlying motivations (what is making them want what they want). Motivations are what they are worried about and what they hope for, even lust for.

Figuring out what the other party is worried about sounds simple, but our basic human expectations about negotiation often get in the way. Most of us tend to assume that the needs of the other side conflict with our own. We tend to limit our field of vision to our issues and problems, and forget that the other side has its own unique issues based on its own unique worldview. Great negotiators get past these blinders by being relentlessly curious about what is really motivating the other side.

Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling has a great quote that sums up this concept: “You must accept the reality of other people. You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we think it’s whatever you say it is. You must accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God.”

There will be a small group of “What” and “How” questions that you will find yourself using in nearly every situation. Here are a few of them:

What are we trying to accomplish?

How is that worthwhile?

What’s the core issue here?

How does that affect things?

What’s the biggest challenge you face?

How does this fit into what the objective is?

QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY BEHIND-THE-TABLE DEAL KILLERS

When implementation happens by committee, the support of that committee is key. You’ll want to tailor your calibrated questions to identify and unearth the motivations of those behind the table, including:

How does this affect the rest of your team?

How on board are the people not on this call?

What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?

QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY AND DIFFUSE DEAL-KILLING ISSUES

Internal negotiating influence often sits with the people who are most comfortable with things as they are. Change may make them look as if they haven’t been doing their job. Your dilemma in such a negotiation is how to make them look good in the face of that change.

You’ll be tempted to concentrate on money, but put that aside for now. A surprisingly high percentage of negotiations hinge on something outside dollars and cents. Often they have more to do with self-esteem, status, autonomy, and other nonfinancial needs.

Think about their perceived losses. Never forget that a loss stings at least twice as much as an equivalent gain.

For example, the guy across the table may be hesitating to install the new accounting system he needs (and you are selling) because he doesn’t want to screw anything up before his annual review in four months’ time. Instead of lowering your price, you can offer to help impress his boss, and do it safely, by promising to finish the installation in ninety days, guaranteed.

QUESTIONS TO USE TO UNEARTH THE DEAL-KILLING ISSUES

What are we up against here?

What is the biggest challenge you face?

How does making a deal with us affect things?

What happens if you do nothing?

What does doing nothing cost you?

How does making this deal resonate with what your company prides itself on?

It’s often very effective to ask these in groups of two or three as they are similar enough that they help your counterpart think about the same thing from different angles.

Every situation is unique, of course, but choosing the right mix of these questions will lead your counterpart to reveal information about what they want and need—and simultaneously push them to see things from your point of view.

Be ready to execute follow-up labels to their answers to your calibrated questions.

Having labels prepared will allow you to quickly turn your counterpart’s responses back to them, which will keep them feeding you new and expanding information. Again, these are fill-in-the-blank labels that you can use quickly without tons of thought:

It seems like __________ is important.

It seems you feel like my company is in a unique position to __________.

It seems like you are worried that __________.

SECTION V: NONCASH OFFERS

Prepare a list of noncash items possessed by your counterpart that would be valuable.

Ask yourself: “What could they give that would almost get us to do it for free?” Think of the anecdote I told a few chapters ago about my work for the lawyers’ association: My counterpart’s interest was to pay me as little cash as possible in order to look good in front of his board. We came upon the idea that they pay in part by publishing a cover story about me in their magazine. That was low-cost for them and it advanced my interests considerably.

Two male cats that grew near each other, fought because they were compelled by their animal instincts. When the female was in heat and one of the males mounted the female, the other male attacked from the back and they fought. Many mammals are very cute when they are young but as they grow and they are compelled by their genes to survive and reproduce they are no longer cute. You will see a lot of aggressive behaviour when it comes to food, territory and especially mating, when the females go in heat and males lose their mind from the compulsion of their brain(this is how their genes made them to make sure they survive).

Even though the two males were friends, caught in their primal needs they are no longer the cute lovey dovey kittens that you knew.
Our primal instincts have the power to cloud our thinking and make us slaves. Life is not good when you are dragged by your animal instincts. One of the things people miss is that sense of wonder at the world when you weren't burdened by adult responsibilities, and when some instincts haven't kicked off properly, like the desire for sex.

// I bought into the fact that women are as good or even better than men, the reason why they couldn't prove it till today was because men kept them down(yeah right).

When you eat beans you get resistant starch, by the time some of the resistant starch gets broken down(and gets transformed in short chain fatty acids) it's too far in the intestine to be absorbed and it ends in the toilet bowl(only a part gets absorbed and acts as a signal for the brain to reduce appetite and increase metabolism), less fat for you. This resistant starch feeds a type of bacteria that slows the absorption of glucose, so if you eat white rice your glycemic index is not as high. The bacteria stays for a while depending on how much and how often you have beans in your diet also it has anti cancer properties.


// Turmeric is rejected by liver but black pepper disables that behaviour, also take it with food that contains fat and not in supplement form(the powder stuff sold as spice).

// We are time poor because
1 We prioritize money (money can keep us from sadness, to a point it can bring happiness)
2 Free time = time confetti thanks to technology like smartphones
3 We overcommit our future time

// The to do list of the time rich
Prioritize time over money
Take all paid vacation
Spend time savoring daily meal experience vs choosing meals(online or offline)
Spend 30 min daily actively socializing, volunteering or exercising
Pay to outsource disliked tasks( takes from stress away)
Keep time affluence to do list (when they stand in line at the supermarket or something similar, they text their friend, call their mom or read a book)

// Crabs in a bucket
When you put crabs in a bucket or any other container that they can get out, the one that wants to get out is grabbed and pulled back. A lot of people act like this because they don't like others to surpass them and leave them alone. The brain is wired to look at those successful and when the one that was once like you is successful it hurts because you have to face the things that are keeping you down, the things that you avoided because they were hard or painful, the things that you procrastinated doing and now the future is becoming the present.

In Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain,2 neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explained a groundbreaking discovery he made. Studying people who had damage in the part of the brain where emotions are generated, he found that they all had something peculiar in common: They couldn’t make decisions. They could describe what they should do in logical terms, but they found it impossible to make even the simplest choice.

In other words, while we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is governed by emotion.


//**********************
Got it, you say. It’s not about me. We need to persuade from their perspective, not ours. But how?

By starting with their most basic wants.

In every negotiation, in every agreement, the result comes from someone else’s decision. And sadly, if we believe that we can control or manage others’ decisions with compromise and logic, we’re leaving millions on the table. But while we can’t control others’ decisions, we can influence them by inhabiting their world and seeing and hearing exactly what they want.
Though the intensity may differ from person to person, you can be sure that everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control. If you satisfy those drives, you’re in the door.

As we saw with my chat with Daryl, you’re not going to logically convince them that they’re safe, secure, or in control. Primal needs are urgent and illogical, so arguing them into a corner is just going to push your counterpart to flee with a counterfeit “Yes.”

And being “nice” in the form of feigned sympathy is often equally as unsuccessful. We live in an age that celebrates niceness under various names. We are exhorted to be nice and to respect people’s feelings at all times and in every situation.

But nice alone in the context of negotiation can backfire. Nice, employed as a ruse, is disingenuous and manipulative. Who hasn’t received the short end of the stick in dealings with a “nice” salesman who took you for a ride? If you rush in with plastic niceness, your bland smile is going to dredge up all that baggage.

Instead of getting inside with logic or feigned smiles, then, we get there by asking for “No.” It’s the word that gives the speaker feelings of safety and control. “No” starts conversations and creates safe havens to get to the final “Yes” of commitment. An early “Yes” is often just a cheap, counterfeit dodge.

About five months after she’d told me to “go away,” I stopped by Amy Bonderow’s office and told her that I’d volunteered at HelpLine.

“You did?” she asked, smiling with surprise. “I tell everybody to do that. And nobody ever does.”

It turned out that Amy had started her negotiating career by volunteering at the same place. She started naming people who were now mutual friends of ours. We laughed about Jim.

In a sudden shift, Amy stopped speaking and stared at me. I shifted in my shoes as she gave me the Pause. Then she smiled.

“You get the next position.”

At that time, there were five other people aiming for the same slot, people who had psychology degrees, experience, and credentials. But I was on the road to the next hostage negotiation training course at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, ahead of everybody else. My career as a negotiator had officially begun.

//
By far the best theory for describing the principles of our irrational decisions is something called Prospect Theory. Created in 1979 by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, prospect theory describes how people choose between options that involve risk, like in a negotiation. The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. That’s called the Certainty Effect. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That’s called Loss Aversion.

That’s why people who statistically have no need for insurance buy it. Or consider this: a person who’s told he has a 95 percent chance of receiving $10,000 or a 100 percent chance of getting $9,499 will usually avoid risk and take the 100 percent certain safe choice, while the same person who’s told he has a 95 percent chance of losing $10,000 or a 100 percent chance of losing $9,499 will make the opposite choice, risking the bigger 95 percent option to avoid the loss. The chance for loss incites more risk than the possibility of an equal gain.

Over the next few pages I’ll explain a few prospect theory tactics you can use to your advantage. But first let me leave you with a crucial lesson about loss aversion: In a tough negotiation, it’s not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the thing they want.

To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.

//**** what gets people to change your behavior
	Warnings and threats have hard time to make people to act. Warnings have limited effect, why ? When you
induce fear in an animal you get freezing and fleeing, fighting not as much. We want to avoid, get away from negative things. Humans are similar but we also use rationalization to fool ourselves. My grandpa smoked he lived till 90 I have his genes I will be fine. This process makes you more resistant to warnings, to negative things. 
	Sometimes negative things make us put our head in the ground. In the case of the stock market, people 
check their account when the market goes well to feel good, when it gets bad the logged less. People didn't want to look when it was bad to avoid negative feelings. Only when the market started to crash did they log on mass.
	In our lives we have bad behaviour now.
	Now:
		Procrastinating
		Smoking & drinking
		Climate change
		BAd mortgages
		Political Instability
		Cracks in relationship

	Those bad things can POTENTIALY lead to this.
	Later:
		Miss deadline
		Health problems
		Natural disasters
		Market crash
		Civilian Death
		Divorce

	Because the future is uncertain we say what's the point in worrying now, bad things might not happen to 
us until it's to late to intervene. 

	People change their belief toward the most desirable opinion.

	If a doctor gave us an advice and he tells us we have 60% chance of diabetes and if we get a second 
opinion where the doctor tells us we have 40% of diabetes. We change our belief toward the positive information. When people get the first advice they think they will have about 50% chance of diabetes and after they listen to the second advice they think they have about 45% chance. People listen to the positive information.

	The ability to learn from good news stays almost unchanged our whole life.

	The ability to learn from bad news changes as you age.It is low when you are young or old. It's highest 
between 30's and 50's.

	People take in more information that they want to hear more than information that they don't. People see 
themselves in a better way they really are. If we try to put a clear mirror and point at the reality it won't work because the brain will distort the image. 
	If we work with the good image we will get better results, if we went with how the brain works and not 
against it.

	Hospital experiment: scientists studied if medical staff washed their hands before and after visiting a 
patient. They installed cameras, the staff knew about the cameras, compliance rate about 10%. Even if they knew that risk of infection is lower with clean hands warnings do not work well.
	Three principals were used to increase compliance.

	Electronic boards were introduced that showed how well you were doing in public. Compliance rate > 90% 

	The first principle, social incentives, we are social creatures, we care what other people are doing and 
we want to do it better. A signal is sent to the emotional center of the brain when we hear the opinions of others. There is a response in the brain when you hear the opinion of others that leads to change. This signal can predict how likely you are to change for the better. The British government sent a letter to people who "forgot" to pay taxes: If you don't pay taxes bad things will happen bla bla ... and in the end it was written 9 out 10 British people pay taxes on time. This raised compliance by more than 15%. Highlighting what other people are doing is a strong incentive.

	The second principle, immediate reward. The board showed fast how well you were doing and it made them 
feel good, it was immediate reward. This works because we value rewards that we can get now than rewards in the future. We care about the future, we want to be happy, wealthy, fit, successful in the future but the future is so far away, maybe you behave badly now and you will be fine in the future or maybe you will be dead.
	The here and now you will rather have the drink, the steak and the fries now in the tangible future. You 
are choosing something sure now than something uncertain in the future.

	Third principle, progress monitoring.
	If you reward people now for doing things that are good for them in the future. Studies show that people 
are more likely to quit smoking, start exercising. Not smoking, exercising is associated with a reward and this becomes a habit, a lifestyle. 
	The brain does a good job at efficiently coding positive information about the future. Also it does not 
do a good job at processing negative information about the future. 
	****	If you want to get peoples attention you want to highlight the progress not the decline. So 
instead of telling the kid that smokes that you might die from cancer, tell him you will be better at sports, you will smell better and be more attractive to girls. Highlight the progress not the decline.


// Mel Robbins 5 sec decision

You will never feel like doing the stuff you need to do, never go for that promotion, never apply for that job etc.. No one will save you, no one will appear out of nowhere and help you. A lot of things you will have to force yourself to do. Don't be "Oh that's not gonna work don't even try it. You have no idea you haven't tried."

5 sec decision can help you
We have impulses for example you want to talk to that cute girl, you want to answer to a question in a meeting etc. but the more you wait the more you talk yourself out of it. The brain has three major functions 
1. It keep our systems working, regulating body to keep us alive
2. When we are sleeping one part of the brain shuts down the other parts catalogues so that you can have memories.
3. It tries to protect us by magnifying risk, so we talk ourselves of doing things including the ones we know that are beneficial.


Stop thinking about stuff and wanting to do stuff but not doing them. Become the person that makes things happen. Look inside figure out what and who you are, what is your wisdom and follow it.


//Daily Consistency = Massive Results: THE COMPOUND EFFECT by Darren Hardy

Small but smart decisions that are in alignment with our core values, made consistently eventually pay of.
By doing things in alignment with your core values you quiet the monkey mind.

Even tough the results are massive, the steps, in the moment, don't feel significant. The changes are so subtle, they're almost imperceptible.

Sometimes knowing that we make good choices isn't enough, to know that we are on the right path, the compound path we need to focus in measuring the percent gains not the net gains.
Humans underestimate what we can produce in years of sustained effort.

If you had to chose between two jobs:
Job 1: 30 min/day but have to show improvement each week, 10$/week 10% weekly compound growth
Job 2: 30 min/day no improvement necessary 5000$/month zero compound growth 5000/month

Accumulated revenue:			Friends and family
51 		-month 1- 	5000
126 	-month 2- 	10,000
235		-month 3- 	15,000
15,541 	-month 12- 	60,000  	What a stupid decision

86,762 	-month 16- 80,000

//
Do the things that are beneficial for you (even though they release low dopamine) and reward yourself with high dopamine releasing activities AFTER you finished your boring activities and at the END of the day.
If you reward yourself immediately the high dopamine reward will make you unmotivated.

Example: for 1h of productive activity you get 15 of high dopamine activity, if your pleasure is to drink and smoke chose something less damaging like playing a game, or browsing the Internet.

It is good to have a day where you have a dopamine detox, don't do activities that give you high dopamine. Meditate, walk, contemplate, exercise. 

When you do activities that release a lot of dopamine you will have a hard time doing activities that release less. That's why you might want to limit your phone and computer usage and other similar high dopamine releasing behaviour. 

If you eat plain rice after you are used to fancy restaurant food it will taste nasty. If you eat it when you are starving it's like you are in heaven.

// 20 second rule
	Put barriers around the things you know are not beneficial but you do them anyway because they are easy 
dopamine rewarding activities. Try to remove barriers around the things you know are beneficial but you 
don't do them because of small barriers. 
	Example, a guy wanted to practice guitar but when he came from work all he did was watch TV. He realized 
watching TV is easy, just sit down and use the remote. If he wanted to play he had to get the guitar case from the closet, open the case, get the guitar and then play. A small 20 second barrier and yet the brain did not like that. What he did was to remove the batteries from the remote put them in a drawer, and get the guitar on a guitar stand near the couch. When he came from work he tried to watch TV but it didn't work, he forgot for a few seconds that he removed the batteries. Instead of getting the batteries he played the guitar since it was right next to him.

Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist.

Experience will have taught them that they are best served by holding multiple hypotheses—about the situation, about the counterpart’s wants, about a whole array of variables—in their mind at the same time. Present and alert in the moment, they use all the new information that comes their way to test and winnow true hypotheses from false ones.

In negotiation, each new psychological insight or additional piece of information revealed heralds a step forward and allows one to discard one hypothesis in favor of another. You should engage the process with a mindset of discovery. Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much information as possible. Which, by the way, is one of the reasons that really smart people often have trouble being negotiators—they’re so smart they think they don’t have anything to discover.

//**
Too often people find it easier just to stick with what they believe. Using what they’ve heard or their own biases, they often make assumptions about others even before meeting them. They even ignore their own perceptions to make them conform to foregone conclusions. These assumptions muck up our perceptual windows onto the world, showing us an unchanging—often flawed—version of the situation.

Great negotiators are able to question the assumptions that the rest of the involved players accept on faith or in arrogance, and thus remain more emotionally open to all possibilities, and more intellectually agile to a fluid situation.

TLC

Despite the treatment’s beneficial effects, it’s still advisable to get a physical exam before you start putting the protocol into practice. In my own clinical research at the University of Kansas, I don’t let anyone begin the full program until they’ve first seen a doctor. This policy may surprise you, but it’s based on sound reasoning. For one thing, it’s always a good idea to check with a physician before embarking on a new exercise program. The same goes for taking high-dose nutritional supplements or increasing sun exposure. Since these are all core elements of the TLC program, it’s important to get your doctor’s okay before you begin.

// video games are engineered to falsely satisfy our human desires.

// Rumination. 
Now that you’ve become more skilled at noticing your ruminative thoughts (after a week’s worth of practice), begin interrupting these thoughts by redirecting your attention each time they occur. You can do this by applying the many techniques described in Chapter 5, including making a list of engaging activities to try this week; identifying and avoiding the specific situations that commonly lead you to ruminate; and scheduling at least one activity each day to take the place of those high-risk situations.

Supplements. Continue as before.
 
Rumination. Keep working to improve your ability to notice rumination, and try to get to the point where you can catch yourself the moment it begins. Likewise, keep experimenting with different activities to interrupt it. Every time you find something that works, try other activities that seem similar. For example, if you find that playing Scrabble™ online is helpful, you might experiment with some other online games. Finally, continue avoiding high-risk situations and substituting more engaging activities in their place. Schedule at least one such activity each day.
 
Exercise. Mark off in your schedule three hour-long blocks of time for exercise this week. (Even though you won’t be exercising for the full hour, this will leave enough time for you to cool down and clean up afterwards.) Each time you work out, the goal is to exercise intensely enough to get your heart rate in the target aerobic range (refer to Chapter 6, Table 6-1) and keep it there for thirty minutes. If you haven’t been active in some time (or even if you have), I strongly recommend that you begin with brisk walking, because it is by far the easiest, most natural aerobic activity for most people to pick up.
 
Light. If you’re going to be using a light box for your bright light exposure, order it this week so it will be on hand for Week 4.

Light. Begin scheduling thirty minutes of bright light exposure each morning, as outlined in Chapter 7. (Or, if you’re consistently waking up too early in the morning, begin scheduling thirty minutes of exposure roughly five hours before your planned bedtime.) Also look for other opportunities to get the benefit of natural sunlight exposure during the day (especially from 11:00 am to 3:00 pm, when vitamin D synthesis is possible).

Social support. Schedule at least three social activities for the week ahead, writing them in your calendar. It’s best to spend time with friends or loved ones whom you can see in person. When that’s not possible, substitute phone calls (or video chats) with out-of-town friends and relatives. Another alternative is time spent on supportive online forums for depression (see pages 176-177).

 Social support. Schedule at least four social activities for the week ahead, writing them in your calendar. In addition, evaluate whether or not you have any truly toxic relationships in your life; if you do, try working to improve the relationships that are open to improvement (see pages 177-178) and limiting your contact with any irredeemably toxic individuals by at least 50% in the week ahead.

Social support. Schedule at least five social activities for the week ahead. Also, try limiting your contact with any irredeemably toxic individuals by an additional 50% in the week ahead.
 
Social support. Schedule at least one social activity each day. In addition, target at least one form of community involvement to participate in during the upcoming week. Finally, try eliminating your contact with any irredeemably toxic individuals.

Light. When your depression scale score drops below 10, you can decrease bright light exposure to fifteen minutes each day. Continue adding another fifteen to thirty minutes’ worth of sunlight exposure (when it’s available) during the day.
 
Social support. Continue as before, and increase your community involvement to at least two forms of activity each week.


Evaluation. By the end of twelve weeks (roughly three months), the great majority of our TLC patients at the University of Kansas have experienced significant improvement in depressive symptoms. At a minimum, we expect to observe at least a 50% decrease in severity from pretreatment, at which point most people no longer meet the full diagnostic criteria for major depression, and the overall trajectory points toward complete recovery. If you don’t see such improvement when looking at your own depression scores, please turn to Chapter 11, which focuses on troubleshooting, and consider contacting a licensed clinician for assistance.

If you’ve successfully applied the six major elements of Therapeutic Lifestyle Change as outlined in the preceding section, you’ve taken an important step toward the goal of long-term freedom from depression. However, even after you’ve experienced relief from the acute agony of depressive illness, there’s never room for complacency when battling such a relentless foe. As we’ve seen, the rate of relapse in depression is very high: Over half of those who recover from depression will face the disorder again at some point.



// How to Have a Good Conversation | Celeste Headlee 

When your job hinges on how well you talk to people, you learn a lot about how to have great conversations – and most of us don’t converse very well. A great conversation requires a balance between talking and listening. This balance is important because bad communication leads to bad relationships, at home, at work, everywhere.

Celeste Headlee has worked in public radio since 1999, as a reporter, host, and correspondent. She was the Midwest Correspondent for NPR before becoming the co-host of the PRI show The Takeaway. She also guest hosted a number of NPR shows including Tell Me More, Talk of the Nation, Weekend All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition. 
 
Celeste holds multiple degrees in music and still performs as a professional opera singer. She's the granddaughter of composer William Grant Still, the Dean of African American Composers. Celeste is an avid hiker, biker, paddler and dog walker.

All right, I want to see a show of hands:
how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook
because they said something offensive about politics or religion,
childcare, food?
(Laughter)
And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid
because you just don't want to talk to them?
(Laughter)
You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation,
we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady":
Stick to the weather and your health.
But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --
(Laughter)
are not safe either.
So this world that we live in,
this world in which every conversation
has the potential to devolve into an argument,
where our politicians can't speak to one another
and where even the most trivial of issues
have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal.
Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults,
and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized,
we are more divided,
than we ever have been in history.
We're less likely to compromise,
which means we're not listening to each other.
And we make decisions about where to live,
who to marry and even who our friends are going to be,
based on what we already believe.
Again, that means we're not listening to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening,
and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.
Now, part of that is due to technology.

The smartphones that you all either have in your hands
or close enough that you could grab them really quickly.
According to Pew Research,
about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day.
And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends
than they are to talk to them face to face.
There's this great piece in The Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
And he gave his kids a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes.
And he said this: "I came to realize..."
(Laughter)
"I came to realize that conversational competence
might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach.
Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens,
but rarely do they have an opportunity
to hone their interpersonal communications skills.
It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves:
Is there any 21st-century skill
more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"
Now, I make my living talking to people:
Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers,
billionaires, kindergarten teachers,
heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like.
I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk
and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this,
things like look the person in the eye,
think of interesting topics to discuss in advance,
look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention,
repeat back what you just heard or summarize it.
So I want you to forget all of that.
It is crap.

(Laughter)
There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention
if you are in fact paying attention.
(Laughter)
(Applause)

Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer
that I do in regular life.
So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people,
and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists.
Learn to have a conversation
without wasting your time, without getting bored,
and, please God, without offending anybody.
We've all had really great conversations.
We've had them before. We know what it's like.
The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired,
or where you feel like you've made a real connection
or you've been perfectly understood.
There is no reason
why most of your interactions can't be like that.
So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them,
but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it,
you'll already enjoy better conversations.

*Number one: Don't multitask.
And I don't mean just set down your cell phone
or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand.
I mean, be present.
Be in that moment.
Don't think about your argument you had with your boss.
Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation,
get out of the conversation,
but don't be half in it and half out of it.

Number two: Don't pontificate.
If you want to state your opinion
without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth,
write a blog.
(Laughter)
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show:
Because they're really boring.
If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.
If they're liberal, they're going to hate
big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney.
Totally predictable.
And you don't want to be like that.
You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said
that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself.
And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion.
He said that sensing this acceptance,
the speaker will become less and less vulnerable
and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses
of his or her mind to the listener.
Again, assume that you have something to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't."
I put it this way:
Everybody is an expert in something.

*Number three: Use open-ended questions.
In this case, take a cue from journalists.
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out.
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"
you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence,
which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let them describe it. They're the ones that know.
Try asking them things like, "What was that like?"
"How did that feel?"
Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it,
and you're going to get a much more interesting response.

*Number four: Go with the flow.
That means thoughts will come into your mind
and you need to let them go out of your mind.
We've heard interviews often
in which a guest is talking for several minutes
and then the host comes back in and asks a question
which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered.
That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago
because he thought of this really clever question,
and he was just bound and determined to say that.
And we do the exact same thing.
We're sitting there having a conversation with someone,
and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
(Laughter)
And we stop listening.
We're just waiting for a moment to interject our story
about Hugh Jackman and coffee.
Stories and ideas are going to come to you.
You need to let them come and let them go.

*Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know.
Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR,
are much more aware that they're going on the record,
and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in
and what they claim to know for sure.
Do that. Err on the side of caution.
Talk should not be cheap.

*Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs.
If they're talking about having lost a family member,
don't start talking about the time you lost a family member.
If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work,
don't tell them about how much you hate your job.
It's not the same. It is never the same.
All experiences are individual.
And, more importantly, it is not about you.
You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are
or how much you've suffered.
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said,
"I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."
(Laughter)
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
[Conversation in the 21st century]
[How are you today? Read my blog!]

*Number seven:
Try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending, and it's really boring,
and we tend to do it a lot.
Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids,
we have a point to make,
so we just keep rephrasing it over and over.
Don't do that.

*Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.
Frankly, people don't care
about the years, the names,
the dates, all those details
that you're struggling to come up with in your mind.
They don't care. What they care about is you.
They care about what you're like,
what you have in common.
So forget the details. Leave them out.

Number nine:
This is not the last one, but it is the most important one.
Listen.
I cannot tell you how many really important people have said
that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill
that you could develop.
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,
"If your mouth is open, you're not learning."
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."
(Laughter)
Why do we not listen to each other?
Number one, we'd rather talk.
When I'm talking, I'm in control.
I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in.
I'm the center of attention.
I can bolster my own identity.
But there's another reason:
We get distracted.
The average person talks at about 225 word per minute,
but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.
So our minds are filling in those other 275 words.
And look, I know, it takes effort and energy
to actually pay attention to someone,
but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation.
You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences
in the same place.
(Laughter)
You have to listen to one another.
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully.
He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand.
We listen with the intent to reply."

One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest,
but long enough to cover the subject. -- My Sister]

All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one:
Be interested in other people.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather,
and there was kind of a ritual in my home.
People would come over to talk to my grandparents,
and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us,
and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?
She was the runner-up to Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer."
And I kind of grew up assuming
everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them.
And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host.
I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can,
I keep my mind open,
and I'm always prepared to be amazed,
and I'm never disappointed.
You do the same thing.
Go out, talk to people,
listen to people,
and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.


// People learn wrongly about food from their family, friends, acquaintances and so on. Some of these people enter the medical industry, but they grew up with pretty much the same information so did those before them. Their is this thing called cognitive dissonance, they already have their beliefs made, new information that might shatter those beliefs is disregarded by most because it's painful. It's painful to be wrong, it's also more painful to be wrong in public.

To not get hurt we want to remain the same. Like the two dogs that barked everyday at each other and when there was no fence they went back to the fence and continued to bark.

There are to many people to blame for the way things are in regards to nutrition, medical personnel are not the only ones to blame.



// 
Depression is like having a lot of mosquitoes on your back. You can't see them, feel them, touch them but they are there, slowly but surely weighing you down, sucking the life out of you and crippling your willpower, intelligence and ability to initiate the things you need to do. Especially new things even if you know these actions will take you out of the hole, the left part of your frontal lobe now has reduced activity that's why it's hard to start new things. 


// motivation, pleasure, happiness, content
Motivation, sometimes you see it in other people, sometimes it happens to you. To feel very motivated after seeing the performance of another human, or after reading a story, or after seeing a video or movie. People get motivated start doing the thing that got them motivated and then pretty soon they lose interest.

What happens is your brain chemically rewarded you when you imagined yourself becoming a better version of yourself. The thing is the brain will achieve homeostasis(balance), it can't afford to keep you high on endorphins and dopamine. When that happens people quit.

Some suggest you have to force yourself, but that just robs you of your willpower. Sure you may force yourself to start the activity, but the process should flow without forcing yourself.

In term of a graph, you want to operate slightly above the x axis, you don't want to be in the negative but you also can't be to high on y axis because the brain will just push that down.

It's like eating candy and rice. One gives high, fast pleasure but then it drops fast and then you feel bad. The other gives slow and little pleasure but it's much more stable, to sudden highs and lows.

What you want to aim at is contentment not hedonism.

//
Unfortunately, neuroscientists have recently discovered that sugar is potently addictive. It can light up the brain’s pleasure centers just like cocaine or heroin. This makes the “sugar habit” 
incredibly difficult to break. Most of us have been hooked on the stuff since childhood.
 
But it is possible to cut way back on sugar intake—enough to reduce the sweetener’s potential depressive impact—with just a bit of effort. It’s simply a matter of finding reasonable, satisfying substitutes for the major sources of sugar in your diet: the soft drinks, candy, ice cream, juices, snack bars, breakfast cereals, and other assorted sweets.

The healthiest sugar substitute of all is fructose, the natural sweetener found in all fruits. Although not as sweet as processed sugar itself, fructose is much better for the body and brain. And fortunately, as you work to eliminate the major sources of dietary sugar from your life, you’ll notice that fruit will begin to taste much sweeter. (In essence, your taste buds will quickly recalibrate, so that fruit starts to taste about as sweet as candy bars and cakes used to.) This happy development, in turn, will make it much easier to continue keeping sugar intake to a minimum.
 

?? figure out plant based foods that have tryptophan
Eat More Tryptophan

 
The brain makes its entire supply of serotonin, a feel-good neurotransmitter, out of a protein called tryptophan. Most of us get plenty of tryptophan in our diets; it’s found in abundance in meats like turkey, chicken, beef, pork, and fish, as well as cheese, eggs, milk, beans, and soy products. But when we’re severely strained, stress hormones can limit the amount of tryptophan available to the brain, which in turn causes serotonin activity in the brain to plummet. This can, in turn, trigger a vicious feedback loop: Depression causes elevated stress hormones, which suppress tryptophan levels in the bloodstream, which reduce serotonin activity in the brain, which deepens the depression, and so on.


// STRESS REDUCTION

 
If you’ve put the entire TLC protocol into practice and still find yourself battling depressive symptoms, it may prove useful to take an inventory of the major stressful circumstances in your life. I encourage you to write them down, and to rate each one (on a 10-point scale) in terms of how much strain it causes on a day-to-day basis.
 
Two distinct strategies can be used to limit the effect of each major stressor: We can work to improve the stressful situation itself, or we can enhance our ability to cope with the situation, even when it can’t be “fixed” in any meaningful way.
 
Improve the situation. Fortunately, in many cases, there are at least some steps you can take to render things less stressful. We’ve discussed many such strategies in Chapter 8, such as enlisting the help of someone to ease your most stressful burdens or finding a confidant who can serve as a sounding board. (In many cases, simply talking over a stressor with a loved one will serve as a catalyst for fresh insights about how to improve the situation.)

Improve your ability to cope. Life tosses out its share of heartaches to everyone. Death, illness, failure, and loss are simply part of the human condition—painful circumstances that can’t be improved, no matter how masterful our problem-solving abilities may be. And whenever we’re faced with such agonizing stressors, our ability to cope with them successfully will determine whether or not we keep depression at bay.
 
The most effective coping strategy—by far—involves turning to loved ones, friends, and extended community for intensive social support. As we’ve seen, the physical and emotional presence of others provides a powerful safety cue for the brain, coaxing it to put the brakes on its stress response circuits even in the face of painful life circumstances. As a result, social support is a potent buffer against the experience of depression.
 
Then again, not everyone is lucky enough to have such a protective network in place. But it turns out that even one caring, committed individual can make all the difference—even if that person is a clinician you see for only one or two sessions a week.
 
In many cases, our ability to cope with difficult events also hinges on the way we interpret them. Sometimes things are not as catastrophic as we think they are. Good psychotherapists are highly trained to help their depressed patients see such stressful situations in a less dire light. But a good friend or loved one can 
sometimes play a similar role—pointing out the subtle and not-so-subtle ways that depression might cause a situation to look bleaker than it truly is.
 
I’ve also seen many individuals find enormous comfort and strength through participation in a faith community. And the benefit often goes far beyond the wonderful social support such communities can provide. It also comes from adopting an interpretive point of view that says, in effect, “As agonizing as this situation seems right now, there’s a mysterious way in which it’s not as bad as I think it is.” I’ve also witnessed several of my nonspiritual patients find a similarly helpful reinterpretation of stressful circumstances through the practice of mindfulness meditation,60 which helps promote a deep, radical acceptance of each moment life presents us with.


Remember, we were never designed for the sedentary, socially isolated, sleep-deprived, poorly nourished, indoor, frenetic pace of modern American life. Our brains, our bodies, our minds, our hearts, and our souls were all built for something different—for a life filled with abundant physical activity, social connection, 
healthful sleep, balanced nutrition, natural sunlight, and the sort of meaningful, engaging activities that leave little time for depressive rumination. By living the lives we were meant to lead, reclaiming the protective features of the past and integrating them into the present, we can overcome depression for the long haul. We can vanquish that treacherous foe once and for all. We can live the depression cure.
 

// nutrition
• Omega-3: This is best obtained in the form of high-quality fish oil capsules (or liquid). Try starting at a total omega-3 dosage of 1000 mg of EPA and 500 mg of DHA50 each day.
• Vitamin D: If, like most Americans, you’re not synthesizing enough vitamin D in your skin—through regular brief exposure to the sun’s UV rays—it is important to take a supplement. I recommend a dose of 2000 IU each day, in the form of vitamin D3.
• Multivitamin: Because omega-3s are fragile molecules, they need some help in the body to do their job. Specifically, they require the protection provided by antioxidants, found in reasonably high quantities in any good daily multivitamin.
• Vitamin C: For added antioxidant protection, I also suggest taking a 500 mg supplement of vitamin C each day.
• Evening primrose oil: Evening primrose oil provides your brain with an essential fat called GLA, which can get depleted when you take high doses of omega-3s. You need only a little of this oil, though—just one 500 mg capsule each week.51 It’s important not to exceed this dose, because taking too much can cause unwanted inflammation.

What is cognitive dissonance?

Cognitive dissonance describes when we avoid having conflicting beliefs and attitudes because it makes us feel uncomfortable. The clash is usually dealt with by rejecting, debunking, or avoiding new information.

Where might I see it?
Consider the following hypothetical situation: John is an avid environmentalist. He is president of the environmental club at school, goes to climate change marches, and John’s family owns an electric car.

One day, he decides to attend a lecture on the negative environmental effects of certain animal products which apparently contribute significantly to climate change. To his dismay, John realizes that he uses many of those products on a regular basis. His stomach drops:

That means that he is part of the problem he is trying to resolve.

But this cannot be! John is a champion of the environment. But, he doesn’t think he is willing to stop eating meat and he knows his family won’t be.

To get rid of the pit in his stomach and resolve the identity crisis he is having, John quickly concludes that the speaker must not know what they are talking about. Also, he thinks, even if animal products aren’t great for the environment, he has done so many other things that are good for the environment, that it must even out (at least). John’s mind is put at ease.

Cognitive dissonance is at work here. To resolve the inconsistency revealed by this new information on certain animal products, John rejects and rationalizes the speech so that his identity as an environmentalist isn’t painfully compromised.

How it causes us to make bad decisions individually
Rejecting, rationalizing, or avoiding information that conflicts with our beliefs can lead us to make poor decisions. This is because the information is not rejected because it is false but because it makes us uncomfortable. Information that is both true and useful can often have this effect. Decisions made in the absence of true and useful information can have harmful consequences. Smoking, for example, has been shown to cause cancer and contribute to various other chronic health conditions. Smokers often rationalize their detrimental decision to continue smoking by either denying evidence that supports its health risks or by considering themselves to be the lucky exception.

How those decisions add up to systemic challenges
Looking further into the effects of cognitive dissonance leads to troubling conclusions across many different academic and political fields. If researchers tend to analyze information in a way that supports conclusions that are consistent with their own beliefs, then cognitive dissonance may threaten the objective methodology that underpins much of academia today. Likewise with social and political causes that require many people to seriously consider evidence that might challenge their existing beliefs, and sometimes change them.

Why does it happen?
Cognitive dissonance occurs when there is an uncomfortable tension between two or more beliefs that are held simultaneously.1 This most commonly occurs when our behaviors do not align with our attitudes – we believe one thing, but act against those beliefs. The strength of cognitive dissonance, or the pain it causes, depends on the number and relative weight of the conflicting beliefs. This mental conflict and the resulting discomfort motivates us to pick between beliefs by justifying and rationalizing one while rejecting or reducing the importance of the others.

We tend to pick the belief or idea that is most familiar and ingrained in us. Changing our beliefs isn’t easy, nor is changing the attitudes and behaviour associated with them. As a result, we usually stick with the beliefs we already hold, as opposed to adopting new ones that are presented to us. In fact, many of us go further by avoiding situations or information that might clash with our existing beliefs to create dissonance.

Psychologist Leon Festinger is credited with pioneering cognitive dissonance. He offers three explanations for why someone might be unwilling to change their existing beliefs or behaviour in light of new, conflicting information:

“The change may be painful or involve loss.” As mentioned above, changing our behaviour or beliefs can be difficult– especially if they are deeply held or likely to bring hardship.
“The present behavior may be otherwise satisfying.” Think of smokers, many of whom know the adverse consequences of their behaviour but succumb to the satisfaction that outweighs it. They are reluctant to accept information that confirms the future costs.
“Making the change may simply not be possible.” Festinger admits that this is unlikely, but still possible. Some emotional reactions for example, can be outside of our control at the time.2
Festinger goes on to point out that it is natural for us to look for internal psychological consistency. It forms our identity and allows us to make sense of the world. This makes sense: it would be difficult to think of yourself as a whole, and complete person if all your beliefs and opinions logically contradicted each other or never lined up with your behaviour.

“…the individual strives towards consistency within himself. His opinions and attitudes, for example, tend to exist in clusters that are internally consistent.”- Leon Festinger
Why should someone be aware of it?
If ignored, our responses to cognitive dissonance can have harmful consequences in our personal and professional lives. Remember the smoking example? This logic can be applied elsewhere in our personal lives. Avoiding dissonance may prevent us from considering new information and consequently, from changing harmful behaviours. If the contradictions between our beliefs and behaviours are not sorted out by making such changes (ie. if we deal with dissonance through rationalization), we might also be subject to hypocrisy.

In our professional lives, cognitive dissonance can result in missed opportunities. If we are hard-headed in our ways and unwilling to consider information that runs against our stance, then we will be less responsive and adaptable to situations in our workplace.

Think of an executive who is convinced that the product they are launching will succeed, and to avoid the painful realization that it may not, refuses to acknowledge the cries of his engineering team who claim that the product will malfunction. Likewise, many of us might reject evidence that our careers are not headed in the right direction, instead justifying our choice to keep on the same tracks and consequently forgo a more fruitful path.

How to avoid it
There is no way of avoiding cognitive dissonance itself. Remember that cognitive dissonance is just the discomfort we feel when our beliefs or attitudes contradict each other. What can be mitigated, is our natural response to this discomfort (ie. how we approach dissonance reduction).

Instead of shrinking away from information that might clash with our existing beliefs, we should try to embrace it as best we can. Part of this would seem to come from being open to change. Being proven wrong, or to realizing your hypocrisy should result in change rather than denial. Evaluate which conflicting belief to side with on the basis of its merit, not how familiar it is. This is easier said than done, but as always, being conscious of our natural response to these situations can help us curve it.

How it all started
While American psychologist Jack Brehm was the first to investigate the relationship between dissonance and decision making in 1956, psychologist Leon Festinger was the first to formulate it into a theory of social psychology. In his seminal book published in 1957, A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance, Festinger details his theory and points to its influence in the psychology of learning.

Festinger became interested in the phenomenon during his time at the University of Minnesota, during which he read about doomsday cults who believed messages from extraterrestrial aliens were communicating the world would end with a great flood on a specific date. He was curious about how they would react when the prophecy failed.

He studied their response, noting that instead of abandoning the cult and their philosophy, committed members doubled-down and increased their efforts to recruit others.

Festinger concluded that members had this response to lessen the pain of disconfirmation, which sparked an inquiry into cognitive dissonance.3

Example 1
Many of us avoid getting medical screenings when it is often in our best interest to do so. We convince ourselves that the symptoms are ‘probably nothing’ and that it will ‘go away by itself.’ This can be problematic for public health.

In 2016, researchers Michael Ent and Mary Gerend analyzed two studies on the relationship between cognitive dissonance on people’s negative attitudes towards beneficial medical screening.

In one of the studies, participants were told about an unpleasant test for a virus (which was fictitious). Half of them were told they qualified for testing, and the other half was led to believe they were not.

The results showed that eligible participants reported less favorable attitudes toward the unpleasant screening than those who were ineligible. So, the unpleasantness of a medical screening affected candidates’ attitudes towards it more than non-candidate’s attitudes. This was attributed to the experience of cognitive dissonance. Participants were caught in a clash between the obligation they feel towards maintaining their health through screening, and the discomfort of going through the screening. To deal with this dissonance, many participants looked down on the screening.4

Example 2
Many of us claim to value recycling and understand its positive impact on the environment when compared to non-renewable waste, but we still don’t recycle as much as we should. If this contradiction is understood, the feeling of hypocrisy it can produce leads many of us to rationalize our actions by adopting the belief that, for example, our individual actions have a negligible effect on the environment. We often see this argument put forward in debates surrounding climate change activism and environmental policy.

Summary
What it is
Cognitive Dissonance is a theory proposing that we avoid having conflicting beliefs and attitudes because it makes us uncomfortable. The clash is usually dealt with by rejecting, debunking, or avoiding new information.

Why it happens
Cognitive dissonance occurs when there is an uncomfortable tension between two or more beliefs that are held simultaneously. This most commonly occurs when our behaviors do not align with our attitudes – we believe one thing, but act against those beliefs. The resulting discomfort motivates us to pick between beliefs by rationalizing one and rejecting or delegitimizing the other(s). We tend to pick the belief or idea that is most ingrained in us, which is the one we already hold. It is natural for us to look for internal psychological consistency, as it forms our identity and allows us to make sense of the world.

Example #1
A 2016 analysis of two studies by researchers Michael Ent and Mary Gerend details our reluctance to undergo beneficial medical screenings. In one of the studies, participants were told about an unpleasant test for a virus. Half of them were told they qualified for testing, and the other half was told they did not. Results showed that eligible participants reported less favorable attitudes toward the unpleasant screening than those who were ineligible. Participants were caught in a clash between the obligation they feel towards maintaining their health through screening, and the discomfort of going through the screening. To deal with this dissonance, many participants looked down on the screening.

Example #2
Many of us claim to support environmentalism through small initiatives such as recycling, but we still don’t recycle as much as we should. The feeling of hypocrisy can produce leads many of us to rationalize our actions by adopting the belief that our individual actions have a negligible effect on the environment. This argument is often seen in debates surrounding climate change activism and environmental policy.

How to avoid it
There is no way of avoiding cognitive dissonance itself. What can be mitigated, is our natural response to it. Instead of shrinking away from information that might clash with our existing beliefs, we should try to embrace it as best we can. Part of this would seem to come from being open to change. Being proven wrong or realizing your hypocrisy should result in change rather than denial. This is easier said than done, but as always, being conscious of our natural response to these situations can help us curve it.

// cognitive dissonance and the path of least resistance when it comes to society
Think about the graph of stress and social hierarchy with chimpanzees we want to be in the middle were we have the lowest stress. The higher or lower you are in the hierarchy the more stress you have. Sure the leader gets the females, he still has to share but he also gets the stress of the lowest member in hierarchy, because he needs to be responsible with the wellbeing of the group, constantly. So we are prevented to change because of cognitive dissonance and the path of least resistance(we like others to take the hard decisions, and only follow to avoid the pain of responsibility).


// more biases to add, there are more than 150
Confirmation bias occurs when we selectively collect evidence that overvalues or supports our claims or beliefs and minimizes contradictory evidence.

Cognitive dissonance occurs when newly acquired information conflicts with pre-existing understandings, causing discomfort.

Recency relates to our ability to recall information that appears at the end of a list of complex data, rather than that which appears earlier.

//********************************
CNU developed what is a powerful staple in the high-stakes world of crisis negotiation, the Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM). The model proposes five stages—active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral change—that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior.

The origins of the model can be traced back to the great American psychologist Carl Rogers, who proposed that real change can only come when a therapist accepts the client as he or she is—an approach known as unconditional positive regard. The vast majority of us, however, as Rogers explained, come to expect that love, praise, and approval are dependent on saying and doing the things people (initially, our parents) consider correct. That is, because for most of us the positive regard we experience is conditional, we develop a habit of hiding who we really are and what we really think, instead calibrating our words to gain approval but disclosing little.

Which is why so few social interactions lead to actual behavior change. Consider the typical patient with severe coronary heart disease recovering from open-heart surgery. The doctor tells the patient: “This surgery isn’t a cure. The only way to truly prolong your life is to make the following behavior changes . . .” The grateful patient responds: “Yes, yes, yes, of course, Doctor! This is my second chance. I will change!”

And do they? Study after study has shown that, no, nothing changes; two years after their operation, more than 90 percent of patients haven’t changed their lifestyle at all.

Though the stakes of an everyday negotiation with your child, boss, or client are usually not as high as that of a hostage (or health crisis) negotiation, the psychological environment necessary for not just temporary in-the-moment compliance, but real gut-level change, is the same.

If you successfully take someone up the Behavioral Change Stairway, each stage attempting to engender more trust and more connection, there will be a breakthrough moment when unconditional positive regard is established and you can begin exerting influence.

After years of refining the BCSM and its tactics, I can teach anyone how to get to that moment. But as cardiologists know all too well, and legions of B-school grads weaned on the most famous negotiating book in the world, Getting to Yes, have ultimately discovered, you more than likely haven’t gotten there yet if what you’re hearing is the word “yes.”

As you’ll soon learn, the sweetest two words in any negotiation are actually “That’s right.”



// DON’T COMPROMISE **************************************

Let’s go back to the $150,000 ransom demand. We’re always taught to look for the win-win solution, to accommodate, to be reasonable. So what’s the win-win here? What’s the compromise? The traditional negotiating logic that’s drilled into us from an early age, the kind that exalts compromises, says, “Let’s just split the difference and offer them $75,000. Then everyone’s happy.”

No. Just, simply, no. The win-win mindset pushed by so many negotiation experts is usually ineffective and often disastrous. At best, it satisfies neither side. And if you employ it with a counterpart who has a win-lose approach, you’re setting yourself up to be swindled.

Of course, as we’ve noted previously, you need to keep the cooperative, rapport-building, empathetic approach, the kind that creates a dynamic in which deals can be made. But you have to get rid of that naïveté. Because compromise—“splitting the difference”—can lead to terrible outcomes. Compromise is often a “bad deal” and a key theme we’ll hit in this chapter is that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”

Even in a kidnapping?

Yes. A bad deal in a kidnapping is where someone pays and no one comes out.

To make my point on compromise, let me paint you an example: A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with his suit. But her husband doesn’t want to; he prefers brown shoes. So what do they do? They compromise, they meet halfway. And, you guessed it, he wears one black and one brown shoe. Is this the best outcome? No! In fact, that’s the worst possible outcome. Either of the two other outcomes—black or brown—would be better than the compromise.

Next time you want to compromise, remind yourself of those mismatched shoes.

So why are we so infatuated with the notion of compromise if it often leads to poor results?

The real problem with compromise is that it has come to be known as this great concept, in relationships and politics and everything else. Compromise, we are told quite simply, is a sacred moral good.

Think back to the ransom demand: Fair is no ransom, and what the nephew wants is to pay nothing. So why is he going to offer $75,000, much less $150,000, for the ransom? There is no validity in the $150,000 request. With any compromise, the nephew ends up with a bizarrely bad result.

I’m here to call bullshit on compromise right now. We don’t compromise because it’s right; we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face. We compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie. Distilled to its essence, we compromise to be safe. Most people in a negotiation are driven by fear or by the desire to avoid pain. Too few are driven by their actual goals.

So don’t settle and—here’s a simple rule—never split the difference. Creative solutions are almost always preceded by some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflict. Accommodation and compromise produce none of that. You’ve got to embrace the hard stuff. That’s where the great deals are. And that’s what great negotiators do.

—“The deal is off!” our mind screams at us in some imaginary future scenario—should no resolution be achieved by a certain point in time.

When you allow the variable of time to trigger such thinking, you have taken yourself hostage, creating an environment of reactive behaviors and poor choices, where your counterpart can now kick back and let an imaginary deadline, and your reaction to it, do all the work for him.

Yes, I used the word “imaginary.” In all the years I’ve been doing work in the private sector, I’ve made it a point to ask nearly every entrepreneur and executive I’ve worked with whether, over the course of their entire careers, they have ever been a witness to or a party of a negotiation in which a missed deadline had negative repercussions. Among hundreds of such clients, there’s one single, solitary gentleman who gave the question serious consideration and responded affirmatively. Deadlines are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the consequences we think—or are told—they will.

Deadlines are the bogeymen of negotiation, almost exclusively self-inflicted figments of our imagination, unnecessarily unsettling us for no good reason. The mantra we coach our clients on is, “No deal is better than a bad deal.” If that mantra can truly be internalized, and clients begin to believe they’ve got all the time they need to conduct the negotiation right, their patience becomes a formidable weapon.

//
The last use of the F-word is my favorite because it’s positive and constructive. It sets the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation.

Here’s how I use it: Early on in a negotiation, I say, “I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I’m being unfair, and we’ll address it.”

It’s simple and clear and sets me up as an honest dealer. With that statement, I let people know it is okay to use that word with me if they use it honestly. As a negotiator, you should strive for a reputation of being fair. Your reputation precedes you. Let it precede you in a way that paves success.

HOW TO DISCOVER THE EMOTIONAL DRIVERS BEHIND WHAT THE OTHER PARTY VALUES

A few years ago, I stumbled upon the book How to Become a Rainmaker,3 and I like to review it occasionally to refresh my sense of the emotional drivers that fuel decisions. The book does a great job to explain the sales job not as a rational argument, but as an emotional framing job.

If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and unmet objectives—if you can get at what people are really buying—then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution.

Look at this from the most basic level. What does a good babysitter sell, really? It’s not child care exactly, but a relaxed evening. A furnace salesperson? Cozy rooms for family time. A locksmith? A feeling of security.

Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate.

For example "I offer the knowledge for a long and healthy life."

When you put crabs in a bucket or any other container that they can get out, the one that wants to get out is grabbed and pulled back. A lot of people act like this because they don't like others to surpass them and leave them alone. The brain is wired to look at those successful and when the one that was once like you is successful it hurts because you have to face the things that are keeping you down, the things that you avoided because they were hard or painful, the things that you procrastinated doing and now the future is becoming the present.

// Ostrich effect
What is the Ostrich Effect?
The ostrich effect, also known as the ostrich problem, is a cognitive bias that describes how people often avoid negative information, including feedback that could help them monitor their goal progress. Instead of dealing with the situation, we bury our heads in the sand, like ostriches. This avoidance can often make things worse, incurring costs that we might not have had to pay if we had faced things head-on.

Let’s say you’ve been eating out a lot recently, probably more than you should. You know you should probably check your bank account balance to see what the damage is, but every time you think about doing so, you start to feel anxious—you know the situation is bad, but you don’t want to see how bad. In the end, you keep up your bad spending habits, but you almost never check to see how much money you’re spending.

In psychology, however, the ostrich effect usually refers specifically to people’s reluctance to get feedback on their performance, even though that information would help them to monitor their progress and successfully work towards their goals.2

We’re sensitive to losses… so sometimes we just ignore them
Humans are notoriously loss averse: we hate losing things. The pain that we feel when we incur some kind of loss is greater than the pleasure we get from an equivalent gain. To illustrate, imagine somebody offers you a gamble on a coin toss. If the coin comes up heads, you win $150, but if it comes up tails, you lose $100. Would you take the bet?

Obviously, $150 if greater than $100—you stand to gain more than you stand to lose. But for most people, the potential pain of losing $100 is stronger than the joy of winning $150. Research has shown that, in order to be willing to take this gamble, most people need to be offered at least $200. In other words, the potential gain needs to be fully twice as large as the potential loss.4

Our fear of losing can sometimes make us a bit short-sighted. Myopic loss aversion occurs when people lose sight of long-term gains because they’re focused on short-term losses. Investors, for example, often underinvest in assets that carry more risk, because they’re afraid of incurring losses in the short term. However, this can lead them to lose out in the long term, since riskier investments have higher returns.5

Outside the world of finance, myopic loss aversion means losing sight of our big-picture goals because we are preoccupied with the costs of working towards them. The college student striving for an A in their course may genuinely want to improve, but the immediate suffering that comes with reading a professor’s feedback (and being made aware of their shortcomings) looms larger in their mind than the pride that they’ll feel in the future. This dynamic often gives rise to the ostrich effect: People often prefer to be blissfully unaware of information that’s hard to swallow, even if that information might be useful in the long run.

We are biased towards the positive
In general, humans have a strong preference for positive information. This bias runs deep, right down to automatic processes that are mostly outside of our control. We tend to make optimistic predictions and have optimistic expectations; we are more likely to remember positive events than negative ones; and, most important for the ostrich effect, we pay more attention to positive information.6,7 By the same token, our excessive optimism often leads us to downplay negative information and to reject more pessimistic forecasts of how the future might play out.8 This bias is at the heart of countless other cognitive distortions, such as the planning fallacy, the Dunning-Kruger effect, and self-serving biases.

Our preference for the positive is a big reason that people stick their heads in the sand. In one study by Betty Chang and colleagues, where participants were asked to think of situations where they had avoided monitoring their progress and then rank reasons why they hadn’t self-monitored more, one of the most frequent explanations given was that people experienced negative emotions when they thought about working towards their goal.9 People also reported worrying about receiving negative feedback or being told that their progress wasn’t good. The anxiety of facing down a challenge is often enough to deter people from really trying.

We’re trying to protect our ego
Beyond our general dislike of negativity, the ostrich effect is driven in large part by our desire to maintain a certain self-image. We have a deep-seated need to feel good about ourselves, and as a result, we often bend our perceptions of reality just a tad, in order to protect our ego. This is known as a self-enhancement motive.10

******************************************
Self-enhancement motives can bias our cognition in surprising ways, helping us to zoom in on our successes while minimizing the impact of our failures. One study, for example, found that a majority of people view themselves as above-average drivers. This finding on its own is evidence that people inflate their perceptions of their own abilities since it’s mathematically impossible for everybody to be “above average” at something. But the real kicker is that people continue to insist that they’re better at driving than most even after they’ve caused an accident and been hospitalized.11

Clearly, our drive for self-enhancement can powerfully sway the way we see ourselves, even putting us at odds with reality. This motive also guides our behavior when it comes to seeking feedback or guiding information. Even if we know, on some level, that we’re not doing a particularly good job at something, it can still be psychologically painful to confront this possibility. Because of this, we tend to avoid situations that threaten to confirm the negative beliefs we have about ourselves.

This fact was demonstrated by one study, where students solved anagrams that were either difficult (e.g. TAUCYI—Acuity) or easy (e.g. ZYIDZ—Dizzy). People who were given the trickier anagrams were likely to come out of this task not feeling too hot about themselves, while people given the easy ones were likely to feel pretty good. After finishing with this initial task, participants were told they had to pick some more anagrams to solve from a number of different tests, and were given information about how students of high and low ability tended to perform on each test.

Students who had been given difficult anagrams were less likely to choose tests that were highly diagnostic—meaning, tests that had a big gap between the performances of high- and low-performing students. Instead, they chose tests where the high- and low-achievers performed similarly because a person’s score on this kind of test doesn’t really tell you anything useful about their abilities. By turning down meaningful feedback, participants avoid having their insecurities confirmed.12 The ostrich effect can be born out of this same instinct to preserve our ego.

We’re afraid to change our beliefs
In the same survey mentioned above, the biggest reason that people gave for not monitoring their own progress was that they were afraid that implementing the feedback would require making a change to their beliefs, or to their behavior. This might just signal a lack of willingness to put in the effort to succeed, and that might play a role in some cases—but there’s more to it than that.

The desire for psychological consistency is a major determinant of our behavior. It’s behind one of the most robust effects in psychology, cognitive dissonance, which describes how people maintain their existing beliefs by rejecting new information, rationalizing it away, or adjusting their perceptions.

The core idea, first proposed by social psychologist Leon Festinger in the 1950s, is that people experience intense psychological discomfort when they hold contradictory cognitions (basically, beliefs or feelings).13 When this tension arises, we feel deeply anxious until we can resolve it. Festinger famously illustrated the power of cognitive dissonance by embedding himself in a doomsday cult that had predicted that the end of the world would occur on a specific day. When the prophesied apocalypse failed to materialize, instead of realizing that they had been wrong, members of the cult doubled down on their beliefs, proselytizing and recruiting new members.14

When we’re committed to an idea, or invested in a specific way of seeing the world, we will go to great lengths to cling to our beliefs. Arguably, the ostrich effect is an offshoot of cognitive dissonance: it enables us to avoid information that disconfirms our established worldview. We’re especially biased to reject information that contradicts our established self-concepts, a drive that is known as the self-verification motive.10

Why it is important
Many studies, across many different fields, have found evidence of the ostrich effect at work. The temptation to bury our heads in the sand is probably greatest when the stakes are high—which also, unfortunately, means that the ostrich effect can have very serious consequences, both at the individual and societal levels.

Take, for example, the case of diabetic patients and blood glucose monitoring. For people who have diabetes, it is essential to make sure that the amount of sugar in their blood stays within a certain range. To this end, there are inexpensive and easy-to-use tools available to help them monitor their levels of blood glucose. And yet, studies have found that most people with diabetes do not regularly self-monitor their blood sugar.2 Personal finance, as mentioned above, is also an area where the ostrich effect can wreak havoc. According to one British survey, only 10% of people who reported financial anxiety actually checked up on their finances at least once a month.2

The ostrich effect can also hold us back from addressing larger-scale problems, such as climate change. There is scientific consensus that climate change is a real, man-made problem, and it will require immediate, decisive action in order to avert its most disastrous consequences. And yet, many politicians have responded to this threat by ignoring and suppressing information about them. In 2012, for example, lawmakers in North Carolina made it illegal to base coastal policies on the latest scientific predictions of how much sea levels would rise due to climate change.15 Ordinary citizens are also guilty of burying their heads in the oil sands, with 18% of Americans believing either that the climate is not changing, or that human activity has nothing to do with climate change.16

How to avoid cognitive dissonance, ostrich effect, donning Kruger effect and other biases.

Though it can be tempting to run away from constructive criticism, in the long run, we’re almost always better off knowing where we stand and how we can improve. Although it may take a little determination, it’s definitely possible to get around the ostrich effect.

Focus on the big picture
Whether you’re trying to improve your health or trying to decide how to invest, it’s helpful to try to adopt a long-term mindset. When you feel yourself getting bogged down in temporary setbacks and disappointments, try to remind yourself of your ultimate goal, and focus on the reasons that you decided to do this in the first place. Although the losses might still sting more, this can help to offset the pain of receiving constructive feedback.

Try being mindful
Mindfulness has been a hot topic over the past few years. Most of the time, people seem to talk about mindfulness meditation as a tool to improve focus and productivity. But at its core, mindfulness is just about paying attention to your experiences as they unfold, nonjudgmentally observing what’s going on inside your mind. Mindfulness is often used as a tool to interrupt harmful patterns that people have fallen into: instead of blindly following an emotional response or instinct, people can simply note that the impulse exists, and then move on from it.

Mindfulness can help combat the ostrich effect by allowing us to distance ourselves from our anxiety about receiving feedback.10 By taking a second to examine how we’re feeling and what we’re thinking, we might be able to recognize that our resistance to this kind of information isn’t necessarily rational and that it might be holding us back. Many studies have provided empirical evidence that mindfulness practice improves people’s self-knowledge.10

Be kind and understanding to yourself
A key element of mindfulness is that it is non-evaluative and nonjudgmental.10 The point isn’t to catch yourself out or chastise yourself for slacking off. After all, nobody’s perfect, and there’s no reason to feel ashamed of your faults. Not only is it unnecessary to be hard on yourself, it’s also counterproductive, and will probably only add to the negative emotions surrounding your goals and receiving feedback.

Don't wait for other people to praise you, if you do a good job reward yourself, it may be with some good thoughts, a break, a snack etc.

Remember, people learn best in an environment where failing is not that punishing. They try more thus they succeed more.

Example 1 - How the ostrich effect can hurt job performance
Receiving constructive criticism from coworkers and superiors is an important element of any job, and essential for employees to improve in their work. However, because of the ostrich effect, many employees don’t seek out feedback, hurting both themselves and their organizations.

Research has found that the drive to protect one’s own ego often holds people back from asking for feedback at work. The same study also showed that, in environments where people didn’t tend to go looking for constructive criticism, people were reluctant to seek feedback because they worried about how other people might judge them for doing so. These findings underline the importance of creating a workplace culture that encourages people to ask for feedback on their performance.17

Example 2 - The ostrich effect and energy consumption
Many people care about the problem of climate change, but given the complexity of the problem, it’s difficult to know how to address it. Unfortunately, research has found that feeling unknowledgeable about an issue can give rise to the ostrich effect, especially when the problem is urgent.

In one study, participants read a short passage about a possible oil shortage. For one group, the text said that the US would have enough oil to last another 240 years; for the other group, it said that oil would start to run out in 40 years. After they had read the passage, participants completed a questionnaire that assessed how interested they were in learning more about the issue. People who felt less knowledgeable about energy resource management were more avoidant of learning more about the problem, but only they had read the version of the text that presented an oil shortage as an urgent problem.18 This finding suggests that, even as people become more aware of how serious the threat of climate change is, this might not prompt them to act, and instead could lead to more avoidance.


Summary
What it is
The ostrich problem describes how people often avoid learning negative information or seeking feedback on their performance.

Why it happens
People are biased towards positive information, and are also motivated to protect their own egos. The desire for psychological consistency also plays a role.

Example 1 – The ostrich problem and job performance
People often refrain from asking for feedback at work, largely to protect their ego, and because they worry about how other people will perceive them.

Example 2 – The ostrich problem and climate change
When people feel unknowledgeable about a problem, and that problem is urgent, they are likely to avoid learning more about it. This has implications for how we approach climate change education.

How to avoid it
To avoid the ostrich effect, try some mindfulness exercises, and try to remind yourself of your long-term goals.



// Self-serving Bias?

The self-serving bias describes when we attribute positive events and successes to our own character or actions, but blame negative results to external factors unrelated to our character. The self-serving bias is a common cognitive bias that has fascinated researchers globally for decades.1

Where this bias occurs
Many individuals can remember their time during school, specifically their different experiences and reactions when receiving a good grade and a bad grade. Particularly as younger students, many people can remember attributing success to their own skills when receiving a good grade on an assignment. In turn, when someone would receive a poor grade, they would perhaps initially attribute the poor result due to external factors. These external factors could have ranged from things such as a professors’ inability to teach the subject, the difficulty of the topic matter, or group members’ faults.

This process is common amongst so many of us, as our initial reaction is to praise ourselves when we achieve success and attribute it to our abilities but blame external factors for failures. This seemingly harmless habit can have significant implications on our life as we age, hence the importance of identifying and curtailing behavior related to it.

Individual effects
Being aware of the self-serving bias and its potential impact on our lives is essential because it can change how we learn from our mistakes and it can affect our decision-making process. The self-serving bias can be problematic: If we do not attribute our failures to our own mistakes, then we are less likely to learn from our mistakes and avoid making them in the future. An essential component of becoming successful and achieving our goals and ambitions in life is done through failing, learning from those failures, and then improving upon them. If an individual is unable to attribute their own failures to mistakes they themselves made, then improvement is a difficult and unlikely process.

Systemic effects
The self-serving biases can have larger impacts when looking at societies and nations as a whole. An example can be seen when looking at nations and climate change. A study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University looked at climate change policy and citizens’ perceptions on which country should lower its emissions. By conducting surveys among both college students in China and the United States, the researchers noted that each group of students held nationalistic self-serving biases in regards to the economic burdens that would result from mitigating climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Their research confirmed that self-serving biases do in fact play a major role in explaining why it is so difficult to obtain an agreement on how nations should implement emission reduction strategies. Researchers noted that interventions that aim to mitigate self-serving biases may eventually facilitate agreement in environmental policy discussions, both at the national and international levels. The self-serving bias can additionally influence other policy decisions at all levels of government. Reducing cognitive biases in policymakers and government officials is necessary to ensure policy decisions are based on fact, and better improve populations they serve.

Why it happens
The Self-Serving bias is extremely common and is described as a human perceptual process that is distorted.3 Researchers have identified several different reasons for why the self-serving bias occurs so frequently among individuals.

Self-Esteem
The self-serving bias is common in relation to our need to either maintain or enhance our own self-esteem.3 By attributing our successes to our own characteristics, and our failures to external circumstances, we spare ourselves of any real opportunity for criticism. The self-serving bias skews our perception of ourselves and of our reality, in order to improve and preserve our own self-esteem in the process.

Self-Presentation
Self-presentation describes how an individual conveys information about themselves to others. Self-presentation is either used to present information to match an individual’s self-image to others or present information to match audience expectations and preferences.4

Self-presentation aids individuals in maintaining their self-esteem, as they are affected by other’s perceptions of themselves. To continue to enhance their self-esteem, an individual actively portrays favorable impressions of themselves to others.5

Natural Optimism
Another reason that this cognitive bias is particularly common, is due to the fact that humans are inherently optimistic. Negative outcomes tend to surprise people, and thus we are more likely to attribute negative results or outcomes to situational and external factors, rather than to personal reasons. Along with our likelihood to be optimistic, humans consistently make what is referred to by psychologists as a fundamental attribution error due to our self-serving bias. A fundamental attribution error, also commonly referred to as correspondence bias or the attribution effect, describes how when others around us make mistakes, we blame the individual who makes the error, but when we make mistakes ourselves, we blame circumstances for our failures.6

Age & Culture
Self-serving bias is a bias that many individuals will experience throughout their lives. That being said, self-serving bias does vary when looking at different age groups and cultures. Researchers have confirmed that self-serving bias is most prevalent among young children and older adults. From a cultural perspective, there is no official consensus regarding self-serving biases and cross-culture influences. However, researchers globally are now further investigating the cultural implications of self-serving bias, specifically in regards to differences in self-serving bias demonstrated in Western and non-Western cultures.7

Why it is important
The self-serving bias can affect many important aspects of our life. Commonly, self-serving bias can affect our performance throughout school, our careers, our performance in sports, and our relationships with other people. Being aware of what causes the successes and failures in our lives, both personal and professional can provide us with learning opportunities to improve on our shortcomings. Understanding the self-serving bias, how it appears in our life, and how we can avoid it to make better choices and decisions is essential to continue to better ourselves and our situations.

How to avoid it
Though self-serving bias is common, there are many ways to avoid it and prevent it from impairing our day-to-day decisions. To begin, mindful awareness helps in first recognizing our susceptibility to self-serving bias when it occurs. When an individual learns about common cognitive biases, they can then begin to notice them, specifically in their lives, and provide themselves an opportunity to self-correct.

Our ability to be self-compassionate is another way to help mitigate self-serving bias. When one is self-compassionate, they are able to reduce their defensiveness and better take criticism when looking to self-improve. Self-compassion is an individual’s ability to recognize distress and commit to alleviating that distress. Self-compassion involves the following components:8

An individual’s ability to demonstrate self-kindness, especially when experiencing a sort of personal failure.
An individual’s ability to understand their common humanity, or rather, that they are human, and that other humans experience the same sort of experiences and failures.
And finally, an individual’s mindfulness, and being able to identify uncomfortable thoughts without judging them.
Being less critical, and more open to improvement through self-compassion is especially helpful for athletes. In sports, self-compassion has correlated with having fewer negative thoughts and feelings9 and aiding athletes in reducing self-criticism and negative thoughts after making mistakes.10

Additionally, athletes who are self-compassionate can better improve and take constructive criticism, as self-compassion provides them with the ability to create realistic self-evaluations about their performance without the fear of recognizing their weaknesses, and lowering their self-esteem.8

How it all started
Self-serving bias first became a notable phenomenon by the end of the 1960s. The theory was first developed through research conducted in parallel to the attribution bias, a cognitive bias that refers to the many systematic errors that people make when evaluating reasons for others and their own behavior.11 During this research, an Austrian psychologist named Fritz Heider found that in ambiguous scenarios, people tend to make attributions based on their own needs in order to maintain a higher level of self-esteem for themselves, defining it as the self-serving bias.

Today, self-serving bias is researched in several different capacities. Laboratory testing, neural experimentation, and naturalistic investigation are all used to further investigate this cognitive bias, its relation to different fields, and ways to mitigate it. Self-serving bias research is common in the workplace, interpersonal relationships, sports and athletic performance, consumer decisions, and computer technology. Modern research regarding the self-serving bias has begun focusing on physiological manipulations, in order to better understand the biological mechanism that contributes to the self-serving bias.12,13

Additionally, substantial research has been conducted to study depression and self-serving bias. Clinically depressed individuals show less self-serving bias than the average person. People diagnosed with depression are more likely to attribute negative outcomes to their internal faults and characteristics while attributing successes to external factors and luck.4 Research in self-serving bias has aided in identifying negative emotions in clinically depressed individuals alongside their self-focused attention leads to their lack in exhibiting self-serving bias.14

Example 1 - Self-serving bias in the workplace
The workplace provides many examples of the self-serving bias at play. Specifically, research in the subject of work-related self-serving bias identified that self-serving bias was most present in relation to negative outcomes and that the more distant the relationship between employees and their colleagues were, the more coworkers actually blamed each other for failure in the workplace.16

Self-serving bias is also commonly found in relation to explaining both employment and termination of one’s job. People were found to typically attribute their personal characteristics to the reasons that they were hired and blamed external factors for their own termination from their job.17

Example 2 - Self-serving bias in sports
Examples of self-serving bias are also particularly common in regards to sports, such as when individuals address their own outcomes in sporting events. Individual sports especially tend to showcase self-serving bias in people, probably because one on one sports have clearly defined winners, and results of a match can be more easily attributed to one’s action than a team sport, with more ambiguous outcomes.18

A study conducted on Division I collegiate wrestlers tested the self-serving bias. The wrestlers were asked to self-report on their performance from their preseason matches and the results of these matches. It was found that wrestlers who won were more likely to attribute their success to internal and personal causes than those who lost.18

Another study completed in 1987 looked to compare self-serving biases between individual sport athletes and team sports athletes. The study gathered 549 statements from athletes who played tennis, golf, baseball, football and basketball, and concluded that individual sport athletes made more self-serving attributions than sports team athletes.19 This research concludes that individual sport athletes and their performance during sporting games had a more significant effect on their self-esteem, thus using the self-serving bias to increase their confidence.19

Summary
What it is
The self-serving bias refers to an individual’s tendency to attribute positive events to their character, but attribute negative results or events to external factors unrelated to themselves and their faults.

Why it happens
The self-serving bias is a distorted cognitive process and is typical for a multitude of reasons. Several reasons that one may be susceptible to the self-serving bias include an individual’s need to improve their self-esteem, the natural optimism humans possess, or an individual’s age or cultural background.

Example #1 – Self-serving bias in the workplace
Examples of the self-serving bias are commonly found in the workforce, with instances of self-serving biases being seen in one’s perception of why they were hired, fired, received a bonus, or performed poorly. People were found to typically attribute their personal characteristics to reasons that they were hired and blamed external factors for their own termination from their job.

Example #2 – Self-serving bias in sports
Sports players are commonly cited when looking at examples of self-serving biases, especially those who compete in individual sports. Studies conducted on high-level wrestlers found that those who won attributed their wins to internal characteristics, while those who lost typically attributed their wins to external factors.

How to avoid it
The best way to avoid the self-serving bias is to firstly be aware of what the self-serving bias is, and identify how you could possibly be using it in your own life. Mindfulness provides an opportunity to find solutions to overcome this bias. Additionally, being open to criticism and being self-compassionate is a potential way to avoid the self-serving bias. By being self-compassionate and working on accepting criticisms as an opportunity for improvement rather than an attack, you will be able to better accept your own mistakes. When an individual learns about common cognitive biases, they can then begin to notice their existence, times in which they occur in daily life, and opportunities to improve upon them.

// What is the Planning Fallacy?

The planning fallacy describes our tendency to underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete a task, as well as the costs and risks associated with that task—even if it contradicts our experiences.

Where this bias occurs
Let’s say John, a university student, has a paper due on Friday, a week from today. John has written many papers of a similar length before, and it generally takes him about a week to get it done. Nonetheless, as he is planning how to divide up his time, John is positive that he can finish the assignment in three days, so he doesn’t start until Tuesday. In the end, he doesn’t have the paper finished in time, and needs to ask for an extension.

Individual effects
Just as the name suggests, the planning fallacy can cause us to plan poorly for the future, causing us to make decisions that ignore realistic estimates of the demands of a task (be it time, money, energy, or something else). It also leads us to downplay the elements of risk and luck; instead, we focus only on our own abilities—and probably an overly optimistic assessment of our abilities at that.

Systemic effects
The planning fallacy affects everybody, whether they are an undergraduate student, a city planner, or the CEO of an organization. When it comes to large-scale ventures, from disruptive construction projects to expensive business mergers, the livelihoods of many people (not to mention a whole lot of money) are at stake, and there are widespread economic and social consequences of poor planning.

Why it happens
We prefer to focus on the positive
Simply put, the planning fallacy stems from our overall bias towards optimism, especially where our own abilities are concerned.11,12 In general, we are oriented towards positivity. We have optimistic expectations of the world and other people; we are more likely to remember positive events than negative ones; and, most relevantly, we tend to favor positive information in our decision-making processes.1,2

When it comes to our own capabilities, we are particularly bad at making accurate judgments. As an example, take one study that asked incoming university students to estimate how they would perform academically, compared to their classmates. On average, participants believed they would outperform 84% of their peers.3 Of course, this figure may well have been accurate for some individual students, but it is mathematically impossible for everybody to be in the top 16%.

All of this means that when we set out to plan a project, we are likely to focus on imagined successful outcomes rather than potential pitfalls, and we are likely to overestimate how capable we (and our team members) are of meeting certain goals. While enthusiasm is certainly important for any venture, it can become toxic if it comes at the expense of being realistic.

We become anchored to our original plan
Anchoring is another type of cognitive bias that plays a big role in the planning fallacy. It was coined by Muzafer Sherif, Daniel Taub, and Carl Hovland. Anchoring is the tendency to rely too heavily on early information when we are making decisions.6 When we draw up an initial plan for a project, we are biased to continue thinking in terms of those initial values—deadlines, budgets, and so on.

Anchoring is especially problematic if our original plans were unrealistically optimistic. Even if our initial predictions were massively inaccurate, we still feel tethered to those numbers as we try to reassess. This leads us to make insufficient adjustments to our plans as we go along, preferring to make minor tweaks rather than major changes (even if major changes are necessary).

We write off negative information
Even if we do take outside information into account, we have a tendency to discount pessimistic views or data that challenge our optimistic outlook. This is the flipside of our positivity bias: our preference for affirmative information also makes us reluctant to consider the downsides.

In the business world, one example of this is known as competitor neglect, which describes how company executives fail to anticipate how their rivals will behave because they are focused on their own organization.3 For example, when a company decides to break into a fast-growing market, it often forgets to consider its competitors are likely to do the same, leading to an underestimation of risk.

More generally, we often make attribution errors when considering our successes and failures. Whereas we tend to ascribe positive outcomes to our talents and hard work, we attribute negative outcomes to factors beyond our control. This makes us less likely to take previous failures into account: we believe that those instances were not our fault, and we convince ourselves that the external factors that caused us to fail will not come up again.4

We face social pressure
Organizational pressure to finish projects quickly, and without problems, is a major reason that the planning fallacy can be so detrimental. Workplace cultures can often be highly competitive, and there may be costs for individuals who voice less enthusiastic opinions about a project, or who insist on a longer timeline than others. At the same time, executives might favour the most overly optimistic predictions over others, giving individuals an incentive to engage in inaccurate, intuition-based planning.

Why it is important
The planning fallacy has consequences for both our professional and personal lives, nudging us to invest our time and money in ill-fated ventures, and keeping us tethered to those projects for far too long. Research has demonstrated how widespread this bias is: In the business world, it has been found that more than 80% of start-up ventures fail to achieve their initial market-share targets.3 Meanwhile, in classrooms, students report finishing about two thirds of their assignments later than they expected it to.4

In some fields, such as venture capital, high rates of failure are often ascribed to normal levels of risk and seen as proof that the system is working as it should. However, cognitive scientists such as Dan Lovallo and Daniel Kahneman believe that these figures have a lot more to do with cognitive biases such as the planning fallacy.3 If more people were aware of the planning fallacy, they could take steps to counteract it, such as the ones described below.

How to avoid it
Merely being aware of the planning fallacy is not enough to stop it from happening.5 Even if we have this knowledge, we still risk falling into the trap of believing that this time, the rules won’t apply to us. Most of us have a strong preference to follow our gut, even if its forecasts have been wrong in the past. What we can do is to plan around the planning fallacy, building steps into the planning process that can help us avoid it.

Take the outside view
There are two types of information available for people to use when planning: singular information and distributional information. Singular information is evidence related to the specific case under consideration, whereas distributional information is evidence related to other, similar tasks that were completed in the past.5 These stances are also referred to as the inside and outside views, respectively.3

Ideally, both singular and distributional information should be taken into account when planning. The planning fallacy is likely to arise when we rely solely on the inside view—that is, when we disregard external information about how likely we are to succeed, and instead trust our intuitive guesses about how costly a project will be. Unfortunately, this is exactly what many of us tend to do. Because planning is an inherently future-oriented process, we are inclined to look forward, rather than backward, in time. This leads us to disregard our past experiences.4

Supplementing planning processes with distributional (outside) data, wherever possible, is a solid way to temper expectations for a project.3 If an organization or individual has completed similar projects in the past, they can use the outcomes of those previous experiences to set goals for new ones. It is just as useful to look outside one’s own experiences and see how others have fared. The main point is to make a deliberate effort not to rely solely on intuition.

Set implementation intentions
Another strategy for combating the planning fallacy is illustrated by a study from the Netherlands, where study participants were given a writing assignment and told to complete it within a week. The participants were split into two groups. Both groups were instructed to set goal intentions, indicating what day they intended to start writing the paper, and what day they believed they would finish. However, the second group also set implementation instructions, specifying what time of day and in what location they would write, and were asked to visualize themselves following through on their plan.

Researchers found that setting specific implementation intentions resulted in significantly more realistic goal-setting.7 At the same time, doing so did not lessen the participants’ optimism; on the contrary, they were even more confident in their ability to meet their goals. They also reported fewer interruptions while they were working. This may be because the process of thinking through the specifics of completing the task at hand resulted in a stronger commitment to following through with one’s plan.

These results show that optimism is not incompatible with realism, as long as it is combined with a carefully thought-out plan.

Use the segmentation effect for better estimates
A related strategy involves breaking up big projects into their component parts, and then planning for the completion of the smaller subtasks instead of the project as a whole. As bad as we are at estimating the amount of time required for relatively large tasks, research has shown that we are much better at planning for small ones: often our estimates are remarkably accurate, and at worst they are overestimates.9 This is therefore a much safer strategy: In practice, it’s much better to allot too much time to a project than too little.

How it all started
The planning fallacy was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky, two foundational figures in the field of behavioural economics. In a 1977 paper, Kahneman and Tversky argued that, when making predictions about the future, people tend to rely largely on intuitive judgments that are often inaccurate. However, the types of errors that people make are not random, but systematic, indicating that they resulted from uniform cognitive biases.

In this paper, Kahnemany & Tversky brought up planning as an example of how bias interferes with our forecasts for the future. “Scientists and writers,” they said, apparently drawing from experience, “are notoriously prone to underestimate the time required to complete a project, even when they have considerable experience of past failures to live up to planned schedules.” They named this phenomenon the “planning fallacy” and argued that it arose from our tendency to ignore distributional (outside) data.5

Example 1 - How the Sydney Opera House was a victim of the planning fallacy
Now one of the most iconic man-made structures in the world, the construction of the Sydney Opera House was mired with delays and unforeseen difficulties that caused the project to drag on for a decade longer than planned. The original projected cost was $7 million; by the time it was done, it had cost $102 million.4

The Australian Government insisted that construction begin early, wanting to break ground while public opinion about the Opera House was still favorable and funding was still in place. However, the architect had not yet completed the final plans, leading to major structural issues that had to be addressed down the road, slowing the project down and inflating the budget. One major problem: the original podium was not strong enough to support the House’s famous shell-shaped roof, and had to be rebuilt entirely.

Joseph Cahill, the politician who had championed the Opera House, rushed construction along out of fear that political opposition would try to stop it.9 In his enthusiasm, he disregarded criticisms of the project and relied on intuitive forecasts for its costs. While the building, when it was eventually finished, was beautiful and distinctive, it would have been prudent to slow down and take the outside view in planning.

Example 2 - The planning fallacy and the Canadian Pacific Railway
In 1871, the colony of British Columbia agreed to become a part of Canada. In exchange for joining the Confederation, it was promised that a transcontinental railway, connecting BC to Eastern Canada, would be completed by 1881.4 In the end, the railway was not completed until 1885, and would require an additional $22.5 million in loans than originally predicted.10

In initially planning the railway, its proponents had apparently not considered how difficult it would be to build through the Canadian Shield, as well as through the mountains of BC. Additionally, there was an inadequate supply of workers to build the railroad in British Columbia. The railroad was eventually built by around 15,000 Chinese laborers, who worked in extremely harsh conditions for very little pay.

Summary
What it is
The planning fallacy describes how we are likely to underestimate the costs of a project, such as how long it will take and how much it will cost.

Why it happens
The human brain is generally biased towards positivity, leading us to make overly optimistic predictions about our projects, as well as to disregard information that contradicts our optimistic beliefs. Once we have set unrealistic plans, other biases such as anchoring compel us to stick with them. Pressure from team members, superiors, or shareholders to get things done quickly and smoothly also makes it more costly for us to revise our plans partway through a project.

Example #1 – The Sydney Opera House
The Sydney Opera House is a famous example of the planning fallacy, because it took 10 years longer and nearly $100 million more to complete than was originally planned. One major reason was the government’s insistence on starting construction early, despite the fact that plans were not yet finished.

Example #2 – The Canadian Pacific Railway
The Canadian Pacific Railway was finished four years late and more than $20 million over budget, largely because of a failure to plan for the difficulties over building through mountain ranges and over the Canadian Shield. The eventual completion of the project required the labor of more than 15,000 Chinese workers, an example of how failure to adequately plan large projects can have a great human cost.

How to avoid it
The planning fallacy is best avoided by incorporating outside information into the planning process, rather than relying solely on intuition. Other strategies, such as setting specific intentions to implement a plan, envisioning oneself carrying out the plan, and segmenting large projects into smaller subtasks, can also help generate more accurate estimates about how costly something will really be.

Why You Might Not Be Sticking To Your Plans

The Key to Effective Teammates Isn’t Them. It’s You.

As discussed above, one reason the planning fallacy is so common is because of pressures in the workplace and other environments to overachieve, and to always strive for perfection. This article discusses the importance of being authentically ourselves, at work and elsewhere. When we act in a way that prioritizes genuine social connection over our own egos, we help others feel safe to do the same. By checking in with ourselves and our motivations, asking ourselves whether we are acting in accordance with our values and beliefs, we can create an atmosphere more accepting of imperfections.


With society’s high pressures to achieve, it’s understandable that individuals prefer to hide their flaws — but doing so comes at a cost.

I learned that lesson when I ventured on a multi-day hiking expedition in Kananaskis, Canada. As a new hiker, I struggled. The trip consisted of continuous steep inclines, which would’ve been difficult even without needing to carry our heavy camping packs. I was slowed down by one particularly challenging climb, yet I refused to tell my teammates in hopes that I would seem perseverant. To my delight (and surprise), one of the more active members requested that we stop for a break. I quickly realized I wasn’t the only one hiding my weaknesses after noticing the rest of the team’s apparent relief.

For many of us, authenticity, or behaving as one’s “true” self in daily life, is quite challenging. Even the idea of it goes against our nature. As social beings, we’ve learned to adapt and blend into our environment, making it challenging to display who we are at times. Yet, the advantages of vulnerability and authenticity are evident, driving its recent popularity among thought leaders.¹ Authenticity even improved my hiking experience — the moment my group admitted to our shortcomings was when we started working better as a team. So, can being ourselves not only help us work better, but help those who work around us?

The truth is, it can.

Researchers in Germany found that not only do authentic workers have higher work engagement and lower work exhaustion, but their teammates had the same results, regardless of whether they were authentic themselves. The effect occurs in reverse — employees with authentic teammates had higher work engagement, even if the employees lacked authenticity themselves. The results suggest that the benefits of authenticity go beyond the individual, and spillover to teammates as well. So, we can improve our teammates’ work behavior by merely being ourselves.²

Why authenticity boosts our teammates
Social penetration theory can help explain this idea. The theory states that our disclosure of personal information helps strengthen the relationships with those we share that information with.³ So, the most productive relationships are those in which information is freely and comfortably shared. By disclosing information in the realm of authenticity, we can help our teammates feel safe enough to do the same.

So what is it about “authentic teammates” that makes them have such a positive impact? First and foremost, authentic teammates do not prioritize protecting their ego at the cost of their work or relationships. Authentic teammates recognize the interests of both themselves and others when making decisions, which allows those they work with to feel safe while being themselves at work. As a result, authentic teammates are more connected to their work, less exhausted by work, and influence their teammates in the same way. By focusing less on appearing hard-working in hopes to get ahead — and more on trying to be better all-around individuals — authentic teammates can make a tremendous impact on their work environment.²

How to incorporate authenticity at work
Authenticity is useful in the workplace at all levels of seniority and can be achieved in several ways. For starters, one doesn’t necessarily need to “be” authentic to experience the benefits. Employees can surround themselves with more authentic individuals in their work environment, thereby benefiting from spillover effects. For managers, including authenticity as a hiring criterion may be the most efficient way to see the advantages.

Of course, employees who don’t want to rely on their teammates can try to improve their expression of authenticity, and managers can encourage authenticity among existing teams.

So how can we spot authenticity in ourselves and others? Two researchers from the University of Georgia and Clayton State University define the four main components⁴ of authenticity to look for:

Awareness – acknowledging our motives, desires, strengths, and weaknesses. 
Unbiased processing – remaining honest in how we associate our achievements and shortcomings. 
Behavior – acting in accordance with our beliefs. 
Relational orientation – recognizing the extent to which our friends and family see our “true selves.”
However, these aspects describe the ideal authentic individual, which may not be realistic for most people. To start, here are some simple questions you can ask yourself to gauge where you stand in each category, including:

Why do I do what I do?
What are the causes of my successes and failures?
Do I pretend to enjoy situations (or agree to things that I really don’t agree with)?
Do my friends, family, and co-workers understand who I am?
Answering these questions and putting them into action will increase your connectivity to your work.⁴ Better yet, sharing these answers assures that your teammates can be authentic at work. Try this: the next idea you share something at a meeting, explain why the idea has personal meaning to you. Then, encourage your teammates for honest feedback about what you shared. You will instantly feel more connected to your work, and your teammates may feel comfortable doing the same at a later point.

Authenticity: is it risky?
It’s important to recognize that sharing information, especially at the workplace, can put individuals in a position of vulnerability that they may not wish for. This issue is especially tricky in firms that have a strong organizational identity and groom their employees to perform and behave in a manner that best portrays the firm’s reputation. As long as employees believe that they can trust their teammates, the benefits of authenticity are significant compared to the potential costs of breaking the status quo. Organizations that prioritize identity will soon realize the value in promoting authenticity in their culture, inspiring a shift across various industries.

We don’t stick to the plans we make

Plans are a sign of productivity. We plan our days at work, our weekends, and when to do a food shop. We also plan for our long term goals.

But despite all of this planning, we often don’t complete our plans. We finish projects after our deadlines. We stop going to the gym after a few weeks. Our ‘healthy eating’ regime becomes difficult to keep up with.

Research has even shown that people usually have to make New Year Resolutions at least 5 times before they actually achieve what they set out to do in the first place.

There are several reasons why we don’t stick to our plans. Biases can make us underestimate what we need to do. They can also make us overestimate our abilities regarding how much we can achieve. And sometimes, we just make bad plans.

We don’t allow for enough time
Why do we underestimate how long it will take us to complete things? In his research, Roger Buehler and his colleagues highlighted a ‘Planning Fallacy’.

The Planning Fallacy describes the fact that people tend to underestimate how long it will take them to complete tasks. We do this because we rely too much on what we intend to do. We tend to ignore our own past experiences and so ignore how long it has taken us to do similar things in the past.

However we don’t seem to do the same for others. When we think of how long it will take someone else to do something, we take into account their past experience and are less biased by their personal intentions.

This bias towards our own intentions can lead us to making bad plans and not giving ourselves enough time to complete tasks.

But, asking for someone else’s opinion can help you make a more accurate plan. They will be more accurate with timings and help you see clearly what you can realistically achieve.

We are too confident in our own abilities
Why does basing our plans on our intentions lead us to plan for things we might not be able to quite achieve?

This comes down to the ‘Dunning-Kruger’ effect. This is the idea that when we are bad at something, we believe we are better at it than we actually are.

We do this because we cannot recognize what being ‘bad’ or ‘good’ at the task actually looks like. The skills that we need to be good at the task are the same skills that we need to be able to understand why we are bad at it.

An example of this could be baking. If an amateur baker ends up making a bad cake, they might think that they followed their recipe really well, but that it was just a bad recipe. They do this because they lack the skills to tell them what part of the baking process they didn’t do properly.

It takes more than just believing good things will happen
We can make our plans better by getting our time frame right and being aware of our own abilities. But how do we make sure we then frame our plans in the right way?

Gabriele Oettingen has done a lot of research into the best type of plans. She found that ‘plans’ that are simply positive fantasies can actually be bad for trying to achieve goals. An example fantasy would be ‘I would love to get that job when I quit my job next week.’

She found that these fantasies aren’t enough, and that a key component for successful planning is thinking about the obstacles that might get in the way of achieving what you want. Identifying what stands between you and fulfilling your goal can make you more committed to carrying out your plan and allow you to deal with each obstacle when it pops up.

Oettingen coined the term ‘Mental Contrasting’ for this. You should contrast the fantasies you have with the realistic obstacles that stand in your way. Doing this brings you back down to earth and calls you to act so you can overcome specific hurdles. An example would be ‘I would love to get that job when I quit my job next week, but my CV is not up-to-date yet.’

Breaking down complex plans into simpler ones
Identifying the obstacles that can stand in our way goes a long way to helping us to stick to our plans. However, when these obstacles are complicated or tempting it can be hard to see a simple way to overcome them.

One way to make this easier could be to use Implementation Intentions, or ‘If-Then’ plans. These are plans where you state that ‘if’ something happens, ‘then’ you will do carry out a certain behavior. For example: If I see a tempting unhealthy snack, then I will eat an apple instead.

//
When people encounter problems in translating their goals into action (e.g., failing to get started, becoming distracted, or falling into bad habits), they may strategically call on automatic processes in an attempt to secure goal attainment. This can be achieved by plans in the form of implementation intentions that link anticipated critical situations to goal-directed responses ("Whenever situation x arises, I will initiate the goal-directed response y!"). Implementation intentions delegate the control of goal-directed responses to anticipated situational cues, which (when actually encountered) elicit these responses automatically. A program of research demonstrates that implementation intentions further the attainment of goals, and it reveals the underlying processes.

// rinse mouth with water after eating sour foods, or wait a few minutes before washing your teeth.


// Hydration
To understand how you need to deal with thirst in a workout, you first need to consider how water can impact your athletic performance. See, when you start to feel thirsty in the workout, you’re already 2% dehydrated. Because water makes up 75% of all muscle tissue and about 10% of fatty tissue, the onset of dehydration—even at minimal levels—can have a significant impact on performance. As legendary strength coach Charles Poliquin says, “Hydration is the greatest determinant of strength. A drop of 1.5% in water levels translates to a drop of 10% of your maximal strength.” With the loss of 5 to 10% of the body’s water supply—which qualifies as moderate dehydration—plasma volume and blood pressure decreases, which forces your heart and respiration rates to increase in an effort to compensate. As a result, your body temperature shoots up, which means you’ll be sweating even more. Powerful electrolytes and nutrients like sodium and potassium are lost through sweat, and when they start to go, you’ll know about it. Headaches, nausea, muscle cramps, achy joints and general fatigue are all likely symptoms of moderate dehydration.  Beyond moderate dehydration—into the realm of severe dehydration—things become dangerous, potentially even life threatening.

The best offense is a good defense
The above paragraph makes it seem that as soon as you start feel the effects of dehydration in a workout, the best thing to do is to reach for the water bottle. Now, if you feel that you absolutely MUST stop what you’re doing and get some H20 into your system, then by all means go for it. But usually athletes will break from the workout and use the water fountain as a stall tactic. If the temperature in your workout environment is suitable, and you’re in good condition, breaking for water is unnecessary. You need to suck it up and get your hands back on the barbell.

More often than not, feeling thirsty in a workout is a sign of poor preparation. Hydration before the class—and after —usually affects how you’ll feel in the middle of it. In order to be operating at peak levels, you need to make sure you’re getting enough water in your system throughout the day. But how much?

There is a plethora of factors that can determine an athlete’s daily hydration needs—including their conditioning level, nutrition, climate and the specific workout (a short sprint versus a 30-minute metcon). However, if you are looking for a general guidelines, follow this formula:

-Your bodyweight (in pounds) x 0.5-1.0 = the number of ounces of water you should be drinking per day.
-Drink 15-20 ounces of water about two hours prior to working out.
-15-30 minutes before your workout, drink 10-16 ounces of water.

The next thing to keep in mind is to not drink your daily water requirement all in one go. If you drink too much plain water in one sitting, you may develop a rare condition called hyponatremia. This occurs when there is not enough sodium in the body, and usually comes about when athletes (particularly endurance athletes) drink too much water. If your sodium levels in your body are too low, then your cells begin to swell with water, expanding your brain tissue and putting pressure on the brain. On top of that, it may also cause your lungs to fill with fluid. Symptoms of hyponatremia can include headache, vomiting and swelling of the hands and feet.

Instead, aim to consume a minimum of 16 ounces of water each hour. This is a general guideline for serious athletes with a fairly intense training regimen, so feel free to adjust as necessary. The point is to balance out your water consumption throughout the day so as to maintain electrolyte levels so the body can perform at its peak.

Considerations
As I’ve mentioned, if you’re in the middle of a particularly brutal workout and feel that you can’t go on without a gulp of water, by all means take some. Just know that your preparation for the workout extends beyond eating well and mobilizing. You also need to consider the temperature of your workout environment. If it’s been a sweltering day and you’re coming into a humid box where a 45-minute workout is planned (not to mention the warm-up and skill work), it’s likely that you may need to take on a little bit of H20 as you get started. However, if it’s a short metcon and the temperature isn’t unbearable, reaching for the water is a stall tactic AND a sign of poor preparation that’s costing you dearly in reps and time.

Lastly, don’t forget to hydrate—post workout! Water helps to move waste products out of the joints and from our muscles, reducing pain and improving our flexibility. Furthermore, it can help improve your recovery time. During a workout your body’s electrolyte balance shifts, which can lead to the symptoms associated with dehydration. If your electrolyte supply continues to stay low, your muscles may continue to feel weak during your next WOD. So if you want to make sure your body is at full fighting force the next day, grab the H20 post-workout.


// This is not me saying bullshit, somebody actually got a Noble prize for this. I am not making stuff up. 

The answer lies in an enzyme found in Methuselah. That’s the name given to a bristlecone pine tree growing in the White Mountains of California, which, at the time, happened to be the oldest recorded living being and is now nearing its 4,800th birthday. It was already hundreds of years old before construction of the pyramids in Egypt began. There’s an enzyme in the roots of bristlecone pines that appears to peak a few thousand years into their life span, and it actually rebuilds telomeres.68 Scientists named it telomerase. Once they knew what to look for, researchers discovered the enzyme was present in human cells too. The question then became, how can we boost the activity of this age-defying enzyme?

Seeking answers, the pioneering researcher Dr. Dean Ornish teamed up with Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn, who was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Medicine for her discovery of telomerase. In a study funded in part by the U.S. Department of Defense, they found that three months of whole-food, plant-based nutrition and other healthy changes could significantly boost telomerase activity, the only intervention ever shown to do so.69 The study was published in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. The accompanying editorial concluded that this landmark study “should encourage people to adopt a healthy lifestyle in order to avoid or combat cancer and age-related diseases.”

So were Dr. Ornish and Dr. Blackburn able to successfully slow down aging with a healthy diet and lifestyle? A five-year follow-up study was recently published in which the lengths of the study subjects’ telomeres were measured. In the control group (the group of participants who did not change their lifestyles), their telomeres predictably shrank with age. But for the healthy-living group, not only did their telomeres shrink less, they grew. Five years later, their telomeres were even longer on average than when they started, suggesting a healthy lifestyle can boost telomerase enzyme activity and reverse cellular aging.71

Subsequent research has shown that the telomere lengthening wasn’t just because the healthy-living group was exercising more or losing weight. Weight loss through calorie restriction and an even more vigorous exercise program failed to improve telomere length, so it appears that the active ingredient is the quality, not quantity, of the food eaten. As long as people were eating the same diet, it didn’t appear to matter how small their portions were, how much weight they lost, or even how hard they exercised; after a year, they saw no benefit.72 In contrast, individuals on the plant-based diet exercised only half as much, enjoyed the same amount of weight loss after just three months,73 and achieved significant telomere protection.74 In other words, it wasn’t the weight loss and it wasn’t the exercise that reversed cell aging—it was the food.

Some people have expressed concern that boosting telomerase activity could theoretically increase cancer risk, since tumors have been known to hijack the telomerase enzyme and use it to ensure their own immortality.75 But as we’ll see in chapter 13, Dr. Ornish and his colleagues have used the same diet and lifestyle changes to halt and apparently reverse the progression of cancer in certain circumstances. We will also see how the same diet can reverse heart disease too.

How Not to Die from Liver Diseases

There are some patients you never forget. On the first day of my GI rotation (GI stands for gastrointestinal, which means I was about to come face-to-face with any issues in the digestive tract from mouth to tush), I reported in and was told to go observe my team of senior doctors in one of the endoscopy rooms, where physicians use a scope to look into the GI tract for all manner of routine procedures. I expected to walk into a colonoscopy looking at a rectal polyp or maybe an upper endoscopy looking at a stomach ulcer. But I’ll never forget what I saw. It fuels me to this day in my mission to help people understand the connection between lifestyle and health (or lack of it).

A sedated patient was lying on a gurney, surrounded by a team of doctors using a scope with a camera. I looked at the monitor, trying to find anatomical landmarks to understand where the scope was. It was definitely down the throat, but the esophagus was snaked with what looked like throbbing varicose veins. They were everywhere. They looked like worms trying to emerge from under the smooth surface of the esophagus. Several had eroded through the lining and were spurting blood. I watched as more blood surged out with every one of the patient’s heartbeats. She was basically bleeding to death into her stomach. The doctors tried desperately to cauterize and tie off these fountains of fresh red blood, but it was like a game of Whack-A-Mole. Every time one was cut off, another sprang up.

These were known as esophageal varices—veins swollen with backed-up blood due to a cirrhotic liver. Watching this nightmare unfold, I wondered how the patient first came down with cirrhosis. Was she an alcoholic? Did she contract hepatitis? I remember thinking how devastated she must have felt when she found out she had end-stage liver disease. How was her family coping? I was jerked back from my thoughts by screeching monitor alarms. She was bleeding out.

The doctors couldn’t transfuse blood faster than the patient was losing it internally. Her blood pressure fell, and her heart stopped. The staff jumped into action with chest compressions, paddles delivering shocks, and injections of adrenaline, but within minutes, she was gone.

It was my job to talk to the patient’s family. I learned that her cirrhosis was not due to drinking too much or from being an IV drug user. Her liver had scarred over because she was obese and had developed a fatty liver. Everything I had just witnessed was preventable, a direct result of lifestyle choices. When people are overweight, they can suffer from social stigma, knee problems, and increased risk for metabolic disorders like diabetes, but this was the first person I saw bleed to death before my eyes.

The family cried. I cried. I swore to myself I’d do whatever was necessary to help prevent this from ever happening to anyone under my care.

You can make do with only one kidney. You can survive without a spleen or a gallbladder. You can even get by without a stomach. But you can’t live without a liver, the body’s largest internal organ.

What exactly does the liver do? Up to five hundred different functions have been attributed to this vital organ.1 First and foremost, it plays the role of bouncer, keeping unwanted guests out of your bloodstream. Whatever you absorb through your digestive tract isn’t immediately circulated throughout your body. The blood from your intestines first goes straight to the liver, where nutrients are metabolized and toxins are neutralized. It’s no surprise, then, that what you eat can and does play a critical role in liver health and disease.

About sixty thousand Americans die of liver disease every year, and the death rates have risen each of the last five years.2 The incidence of liver cancer alone has been rising about 4 percent every year over the last decade.3 Liver dysfunction can run in families, like the iron-overload disease hemochromatosis. It can be caused by infections that can lead to liver cancer, or it can stem from drugs—most often inadvertent or intentional overdoses of Tylenol.4 The most common causes, however, are drink and food: alcoholic liver disease and fatty liver disease.

//************************************************************
ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE

According to a famous series of papers in the Journal of the American Medical Association called the “Actual Causes of Death in the United States” [emphasis added], the leading killer of Americans in the year 2000 was tobacco, followed by diet and inactivity. The third-leading killer? Alcohol.5 About half of alcohol-related deaths were due to sudden causes like motor vehicle accidents; the other half were slower, and the leading cause was alcoholic liver disease.6

Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to an accumulation of fat in the liver (what’s known as fatty liver), which can cause inflammation and result in liver scarring and, eventually, liver failure. The CDC defines excessive drinking as the regular consumption of more than one drink a day for women and more than two a day for men. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 8 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces (a “shot”) of hard liquor.7 Progression of the disease can usually be halted by stopping drinking, but sometimes it’s too late.8

Heavy alcohol consumption can cause a fatty liver in less than three weeks,9 but it usually resolves within four to six weeks after stopping drinking.10 But in 5–15 percent of cases, the disease continues to progress, and the liver starts to scar despite alcohol cessation.11

Similarly, once alcohol-induced hepatitis (liver inflammation) is diagnosed, three-year survival rates can be as high as 90 percent among people who stop drinking after diagnosis.12 But as many as 18 percent of them go on to develop cirrhosis, an irreparable scarring of the liver.13

The best strategy to avoid alcoholic liver disease is to not drink so much in the first place. But if you do drink excessively, help is available. Though most people who drink may not be alcoholics,14 there is convincing evidence that twelve-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous can be effective for those who do suffer from alcohol dependence.

Isn’t Moderate Drinking Beneficial?

Everyone agrees that heavy drinking, drinking during pregnancy, and binge drinking are bad ideas, but what about “moderate” drinking? Yes, excessive drinkers appear to significantly shorten their lives, but so can teetotalers.16 While smoking is bad for you and smoking a lot is worse, that logic may not hold for alcohol consumption. There actually appears to be a beneficial effect on overall mortality by drinking some alcohol—but only, it seems, for those who are not taking good care of themselves already.17

Moderate drinking does appear to protect against heart disease, perhaps because of a blood-thinning effect,18 but even light drinking (less than one drink a day) has been found to increase cancer risk, as you’ll see in chapter 11. How could something that increases cancer risk still prolong life? Cancer is “only” our second-leading killer disease. Because heart disease is the leading cause of death, it explains why people who drink moderately may live longer lives than those who abstain. But this advantage may be restricted only to those who fail to practice a bare modicum of healthy behaviors.19

To find out who might benefit from moderate alcohol consumption, researchers recruited close to ten thousand men and women and followed them for seventeen years after assessing their drinking and lifestyle habits. The results were published in a paper entitled “Who Benefits Most from the Cardioprotective Properties of Alcohol Consumption—Health Freaks or Couch Potatoes?” What constituted a “health freak”? According to the researchers’ definition, anyone who exercises thirty minutes a day, doesn’t smoke, and eats at least one serving of fruits or vegetables daily.20 (What does that say about our current diets if eating a single apple means you’re a “health freak”?)

One to two drinks a day did lower the risk of heart disease for the “couch potatoes,” those living unhealthy lifestyles. But people who practiced even the bare minimum of healthy behaviors showed no benefit from alcohol. The lesson: Grapes, barley, and potatoes are best eaten in their nondistilled form, and Johnnie Walker is no substitute for actual walking.

//***************************************************************************
NONALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE

The most common cause of a fatty liver is not alcohol but nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). You may remember the blockbuster documentary Super Size Me, in which the film’s director, Morgan Spurlock, ate exclusively at McDonald’s for a month. Predictably, Spurlock’s weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol all went up—but so did his liver enzymes. That was a sign that his liver cells were dying and spilling their contents into his bloodstream. How was his diet causing liver damage? Let’s put it this way: He was beginning to turn his liver into human foie gras (fatty liver pâté).

Some critics wrote off the film as overly sensational, but researchers in Sweden took it seriously enough to formally replicate Spurlock’s one-man experiment. In their study, a group of men and women agreed to eat two fast-food meals a day. At the start, their liver enzyme levels were normal, but after just one week of this diet, more than 75 percent of the volunteers’ liver function test results became pathological.21 If an unhealthy diet can cause liver damage within just seven days, it should be no surprise that NAFLD has quietly become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, afflicting an estimated seventy million people.22 That’s about one in three adults. Nearly 100 percent of those with severe obesity may be affected.23

Like alcoholic fatty liver, NAFLD starts with a buildup of fat deposits in the liver that cause no symptoms. In rare cases, this can progress to inflammation and, over years, end up scarring the liver into a state of cirrhosis, resulting in liver cancer, liver failure, and even death—as I saw in that endoscopy suite.24

Fast food is so effective at instigating the disease because NAFLD is associated with the intake of soft drinks and meat. Drinking just one can of soda a day appears to raise the odds of getting fatty liver disease by 45 percent.25 Meanwhile, those who eat the meat equivalent of fourteen chicken nuggets or more daily have nearly triple the rate of fatty liver disease compared to people who eat seven nuggets’ worth or less.26

NAFLD has been characterized as a “tale of fat and sugar,”27 but not all fat affects the liver similarly. People suffering from fatty liver inflammation were found to be consuming more animal fat (and cholesterol) but less plant fat (and fiber and antioxidants).28 This may explain why adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans has been associated with less severe fatty liver disease even though it is not typically a low-fat diet.29

NAFLD may also be caused by cholesterol overload.30 The dietary cholesterol found in eggs, meat, and dairy can become oxidized and then set off a chain reaction that results in excess fat in the liver.31 When the concentration of cholesterol in your liver cells gets too high, it can crystallize like rock candy and result in inflammation. This process is similar to the way uric acid crystals cause gout (as we’ll see in chapter 10).32 Your white blood cells try to engulf the cholesterol crystals but then die in the process, spilling out inflammatory compounds. This may explain how benign fatty liver cases can turn into serious hepatitis.33

To explore the relationship between diet and serious liver disease, about nine thousand American adults were studied for thirteen years. The researchers noted that their most important finding may be that cholesterol consumption was a strong predictor of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Those consuming the amount of cholesterol found in two Egg McMuffins34 or more each day appeared to double their risk of hospitalization or death.35

Your best bet for avoiding NAFLD, the most common cause of liver disease, may be to avoid excess calories, cholesterol, saturated fat, and sugar.


//
VIRAL HEPATITIS

Another common cause of liver disease is viral hepatitis, which is triggered by one or more of five different viruses: hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E. The mode of transmission and prognosis differs for each of these viruses. Hepatitis A is spread primarily through food or water that is tainted with contaminated feces. It can be prevented through vaccination, avoiding raw and undercooked shellfish, and trying to ensure that everyone who handles your food washes their hands after changing diapers or using the toilet.

While hepatitis A virus is foodborne, hepatitis B virus is bloodborne and is transmitted sexually. As with hepatitis A, an effective vaccine is available against hepatitis B that every child should get. Hepatitis D virus infection can only occur in someone who is already infected with hepatitis B and so can be prevented by preventing hepatitis B. So get vaccinated and refrain from intravenous drug use and unsafe sex.

Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine for the hepatitis C virus, the most dreaded of liver viruses. Exposure can lead to a chronic infection that, over decades, can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Hepatitis C is now the leading cause of liver transplants.36

Chlorella and Hepatitis C

The green algae chlorella looks promising for the treatment of hepatitis C. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that about two teaspoons a day of chlorella boosted the activity of natural killer cells in participants’ bodies, which can naturally kill hepatitis C-infected cells.37 A clinical study of hepatitis-C patients found that chlorella supplementation may lower the level of liver inflammation, but the study was small and uncontrolled.38

There is a desperate need for alternative treatments for hepatitis C, as older, less expensive therapies frequently fail due to their unbearable side effects, whereas newer, more tolerable drugs cost as much as $1,000 per pill.39 Chlorella may help as an adjunct (additional) therapy or for those who can’t tolerate or afford conventional antiviral therapy but may not be without risk (see here).

Hepatitis C is transmitted via blood, usually through sharing needles rather than via blood transfusions, now that the blood supply is screened for the virus. However, sharing personal-care items that can be contaminated with trace amounts of blood, such as toothbrushes and razors, may also present a risk.40

Although a case was once reported involving a woman who contracted hepatitis C from sharing a supermarket meat slicer with an infected coworker,41 the virus would not naturally be present in the meat itself, as humans and chimpanzees are the only animals who appear susceptible to it.

The same cannot be said for hepatitis E virus.

Preventing Hepatitis E Through Diet

As one of the CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis laboratory chiefs explained in a paper entitled “Much Meat, Much Malady: Changing Perceptions of the Epidemiology of Hepatitis E,” hepatitis E virus is now considered a zoonotic disease, able to spread from animals to humans, and pigs may be the primary viral reservoir.42

The shift in thinking began in 2003, when researchers in Japan linked the hepatitis E virus (HEV) with the consumption of grilled pork liver. After testing pig livers from Japanese grocery stores, the researchers determined that nearly 2 percent of the meat tested positive for HEV.43 In the United States, it was even worse: 11 percent of commercial pig livers purchased from grocery stores were contaminated with HEV.44

That’s alarming, but how many people really eat pig livers? What about plain old pork?

Unfortunately, pork may harbor HEV as well. Experts suspect that much of the American population has been exposed to this virus, as there is known to be a relatively high prevalence of HEV antibodies among U.S. blood donors. This exposure may be a result of individuals consuming HEV-contaminated pork.45

So do more people die of liver disease in countries where pork is more popular? It appears so. The relationship between national per capita pork consumption and deaths from liver disease correlates as tightly as per capita alcohol consumption and liver fatalities. Each pork chop consumed per capita may be associated with about two beers’ worth of increased liver mortality risk on a countrywide scale.46

Aren’t viruses deactivated by cooking? Usually, but there’s always the problem of cross-contaminating your hands or kitchen surfaces while handling raw meat. Once meat is in the oven, most foodborne pathogens can be destroyed by cooking the meat to proper internal cooking temperatures, with an emphasis on proper. Researchers at the National Institute of Health subjected the hepatitis E virus to various levels of heat and found that HEV can survive the internal temperature of meat cooked rare.47 So if you cook pork, invest in a meat thermometer and make sure to follow proper handling techniques, including washing kitchen surfaces with a bleach solution.48

Though most people who develop hepatitis E recover completely, it can be deadly for pregnant women: The risk of death during the third trimester can reach as high as 30 percent.49 If you are pregnant, please be especially careful about pork preparation. And if there are people in the household who like their pork pink in the middle, they should be sure to wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom.

Weight-Loss Supplements and Liver Disease

We’ve all seen those marketing schemes involving products espousing all sorts of health claims. And given the pyramid-like multilevel structure of those types of distribution programs—you earn money by selling products and also for recruiting others to sell—word can spread pretty fast, which is particularly troubling when PR outruns the truth.

Indeed, while the vast majority of drug-induced liver injuries are caused by conventional medications, liver damage caused by certain classes of dietary supplements can be even more serious and may lead to higher rates of liver transplants and death.50 Multilevel marketers of products later linked to toxic reactions (such as noni juice51 and Herbalife52) have pointed to scientific studies to support their health claims. However, a public health review found that such studies often seemed “deliberately created for marketing purposes” and were presented in such a way as to appear “designed to mislead potential consumers.” Often, multilevel marketing study researchers didn’t disclose their funding sources, but a little detective work can expose a web of financial conflicts of interest.53

These suspect studies were the same ones cited to provide proof of safety for their products. For example, a multilevel marketing company that sells mangosteen juice cited a study they paid for to support its assertion that their product is “safe for everyone.” The study involved exposing just thirty people to their product with another ten people given a placebo. With so few people tested, the stuff could literally kill 1 or 2 percent of users and you wouldn’t know.54

A study that the multilevel marketing company behind a supplement called Metabolife cited for safety placed thirty-five people on the stuff.55 Metabolife has since been withdrawn from the market after being linked to heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and deaths.56 Hydroxycitric acid, a component of such products as Hydroxycut, was studied on forty people.57 No serious adverse effects were found, but the story ended the same way: Hydroxycut was withdrawn after dozens of verified cases of organ damage were brought to light—including massive liver failure requiring transplantation and even death.58 Until the multibillion-dollar herbal supplement industry is better regulated, you’re better off saving your money—and your health—by sticking to real food.

PROTECTING THE LIVER AT BREAKFAST

Specific plant foods have been found to be protective of the liver. For instance, starting out the day with a bowl of oatmeal and (surprisingly) coffee may help safeguard our liver function.

Oatmeal

In numerous population studies, consumption of whole grains has been associated with reduced risk for a range of chronic diseases,59 but it’s hard to tease out whether eating whole grains may just be a marker for a healthier lifestyle in general. For example, people who eat whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat, and brown rice, also tend to be more physically active, smoke less, and eat more fruits, vegetables, and dietary fiber60 than those who might prefer a breakfast of Froot Loops, for example. No wonder the former group may have lower disease risk. Fortunately, researchers can control for these factors, effectively comparing nonsmokers only to nonsmokers with similar diet and exercise habits. When that’s done, whole grains still appear to be protective.61

In other words, the evidence seems clear that oatmeal eaters may have lower rates of disease, but that’s not the same as showing that if you start eating more oatmeal, your risk will drop. To prove cause and effect, we need to put it to the test by performing an interventional trial: Change people’s diets and see what happens. Ideally, researchers would randomly split people into two groups and give half of them oatmeal and the other half a placebo—a fake, similar-tasting and -looking oatmeal. Neither the study subjects nor the researchers themselves can know who’s in which group until the end. This robust, double-blind method is easy to use when studying drugs, as you just give people a sugar pill that looks like the drug in question. As we’ve discussed, it’s not as easy to make placebo food.

But in 2013, a group of researchers published the first double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oatmeal in overweight men and women.62 They found a significant reduction in liver inflammation in the real oatmeal group, but that may have been because they lost so much more weight than the controls (that is, the placebo-oatmeal eaters). Nearly 90 percent of the real-oatmeal-treated subjects had lost weight, compared with no weight loss, on average, among the control group. So it may be that the benefits of whole grains on liver function are indirect.63 A follow-up study in 2014 helped confirm the findings of a protective role for whole grains in nonalcoholic fatty liver patients in reducing the risk of liver inflammation. In this study, refined grain consumption was associated with increased risk of the disease.64 So lay off the Wonder Bread and stick to truly wonderful whole-grain foods, including oatmeal.

Making Your Own Whole-Cranberry Cocktail

A specific class of plant compounds called anthocyanins—the purple, red, and blue pigments in such plants as berries, grapes, plums, red cabbage, and red onions—have been found to prevent fat accumulation in human liver cells in in vitro studies.65 A single confirmatory clinical (human) trial has been published in which a purple sweet potato concoction successfully dampened liver inflammation better than a placebo.66

When it came to suppressing the growth of human liver cancer cells in a petri dish,67 cranberries beat out the other most common fruits in the United States: apples, bananas, grapefruits, grapes, lemons, oranges, peaches, pears, pineapples, and strawberries. Other studies have found that cranberries are also effective in vitro against additional cancers, including those of the brain,68 breast,69 colon,70 lung,71 mouth,72 ovary,73 prostate,74 and stomach.75 Unfortunately, there have yet to be clinical studies of the effects of cranberries on cancer patients that confirm these findings.

Moreover, to the drug industry’s chagrin, scientists have been unable to pin down the active ingredients involved in cranberries’ special effects. Extracts concentrating individual components fail to match the anticancer effects of the cranberry as a whole,76 which of course can’t be patented. More proof that it’s nearly always best to give preference to whole foods.

How do you do that with cranberries, though, since they’re so tart?

It’s not easy at the grocery store. Ninety-five percent of cranberries are sold in the form of processed products, such as juices and sauces.77 In fact, to get the same amount of anthocyanins found in a single cup of fresh or frozen cranberries, you’d have to drink sixteen cups of cranberry juice cocktail, eat seven cups of dried cranberries, or make your way through twenty-six cans of cranberry sauce.78 The ruby-red phytonutrient found in cranberries is a powerful antioxidant, but the high-fructose corn syrup added to cranberry cocktail acts as a pro-oxidant, canceling out some of the benefit.79

Here’s a simple recipe for a whole-food version of a tasty cranberry beverage, what I call my Pink Juice:

 

1 handful fresh or frozen cranberries

2 cups water

8 teaspoons erythritol (a naturally derived low-calorie sweetener; read more about erythritol and other sweeteners in part 2)

Place all the ingredients in a blender and blend at high speed. Pour over ice and serve.

 

At just twelve calories, this recipe has twenty-five times fewer calories and at least eight times more phytonutrients than typical cranberry juice drinks.80

For an extra boost, blend in some fresh mint leaves. You’ll get a weird-looking green foam on top, but not only will it taste good, you’ll be happy to know that you’re chugging down berries and dark, leafy greens, two of the healthiest foods on the planet. Bottoms up!


//************************************
Liver cancers are among the most avoidable cancers, through hepatitis B vaccination, control of hepatitis C transmission, and reduction of alcohol consumption. These three measures could, in principle, wipe out 90 percent of liver cancers worldwide. It remains unclear whether coffee drinking has an additional role to play, but such a role would be limited compared with preventing liver damage in the first place.

With liver disease, as always, prevention is the key. All the most serious liver conditions—liver cancer, liver failure, and cirrhosis—can start with an inflamed liver. That inflammation can be caused by an infection or the buildup of fatty deposits. Liver viruses can be prevented by common-sense measures. Don’t inject drugs, do get vaccinated, and do practice safe sex. Liver fat can also be prevented by common sense measures: Avoid excess consumption of alcohol, calories, cholesterol, saturated fat, and sugar.

FOODS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED RISK OF BLOOD CANCERS

After following more than sixty thousand people for more than a dozen years, University of Oxford researchers found that those who consume a plant-based diet are less likely to develop all forms of cancer combined. The greatest protection appeared to be against blood cancers. The incidence of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma among those eating vegetarian diets is nearly half that of those eating meat.6 Why is this greatly reduced risk of blood cancers associated with a more plant-based diet? The British Journal of Cancer concluded, “More research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this.”7 While they are figuring out the reasons, why not get a head start and try adding more healthy plant foods to your plates today?

Greens and Cancer

The key to cancer prevention and treatment is to keep tumor cells from multiplying out of control while allowing healthy cells to grow normally. Chemotherapy and radiation can do a great job of wiping out cancer cells, but healthy cells can get caught in the crossfire. Some compounds in plants, though, may be more discriminating.

For instance, sulforaphane, considered one of the more active components in cruciferous vegetables, kills human leukemia cells in a petri dish while having little impact on the growth of normal cells.8 As we’ve discussed, cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, but there are many others in this family, such as collard greens, watercress, bok choy, kohlrabi, rutabaga, turnips, arugula, radishes (including horseradish), wasabi, and all types of cabbage.

It’s intriguing that dripping cabbage compounds on cancer cells affects them in a laboratory, but what really matters is whether people with blood cancers who eat lots of vegetables actually live longer than those who don’t. For about eight years, Yale University researchers followed more than five hundred women with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Those who started out eating three or more servings of vegetables daily had a 42 percent improved survival rate over those who ate less. Green, leafy vegetables, including salad and cooked greens, and citrus fruits appeared most protective.9 It’s not clear, though, whether the survival benefit arose from helping to keep the cancer at bay or from improving patients’ tolerance to the chemotherapy and radiation treatments they were receiving. The accompanying editorial in the journal Leukemia & Lymphoma suggested that a “lymphoma diagnosis may be an important ‘teachable’ moment to improve diet.…”10 I would suggest you not wait until a cancer diagnosis to clean up your diet.

The Iowa Women’s Health Study, which has followed more than thirty-five thousand women for decades, found that higher broccoli and other cruciferous vegetable intake was associated with lower risk of getting non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the first place.11 Likewise, a study at the Mayo Clinic found that those who ate about five or more servings of green, leafy vegetables a week had roughly half the odds of getting lymphoma compared with those who ate less than one serving a week.12

******************************* dietary intake, not supplementary intake **************

								NO ANTIOIXIDANT SUPPLEMENTS 
Some of the plant-based protection might have been due to the antioxidant properties of fruits and vegetables. Higher dietary intake of antioxidants is associated with significantly lower lymphoma risk. Note I said dietary intake, not supplementary intake. Antioxidant supplements don’t appear to work.13 For example, getting lots of vitamin C in your diet is associated with lower lymphoma risk, but taking in even more vitamin C in pill form did not seem to help. The same was found for carotenoid antioxidants like beta-carotene.14 Apparently, pills do not have the same cancer-fighting effects as produce.

When it comes to certain other cancers, like those of the digestive tract, antioxidant supplements may even make things worse. Combinations of antioxidants like vitamin A, vitamin E, and beta-carotene in pill form were associated with increased risk of death in those who took them.15 Supplements contain only a select few antioxidants, whereas your body relies on hundreds of them, all working synergistically to create a network to help the body dispose of free radicals. High doses of a single antioxidant may upset this delicate balance and may actually diminish your body’s ability to fight cancer.16

When you buy antioxidant supplements, you may be doling out money to live a shorter life. Save your cash and your health by eating the real thing: food.

*************************** antioxidants
In terms of antioxidant bang for your buck, açai berries get honorable mention, beating out other superstars, such as walnuts, apples, and cranberries. The bronze for best bargain, though, goes to cloves, the silver to cinnamon, and the gold for most antioxidants per dollar—according to a USDA database of common foods—goes to purple cabbage.24 Açai berries, however, would probably make a tastier smoothie.
