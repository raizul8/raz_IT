Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It causes inflammation of your digestive tract, which can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition.

Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people. This inflammation often spreads into the deeper layers of the bowel.

Crohn's disease can be both painful and debilitating, and sometimes may lead to life-threatening complications.

remedy messaging
****************************************************************************************************
From Coke to Coors: Unintended Consequences

Sometimes dietary policy decisions can have unintended consequences. Swapping out sugary cookies for salty chips, for example, might not do the public’s health many favors. One field study of a tax on soda found that it can drop soft drink purchases, but households may just end up buying more beer.779 Another study found that, ironically, calorie labeling of sugary drinks led to an increase in consumption, presumed to be because the consumers may have previously overestimated their caloric content.780

Stark warnings about the risks of unintended, negative consequences of obesity-targeted health policies are trumpeted by those with ties to the likes of Coca-Cola, Kraft, PepsiCo, Wrigley, Red Bull, the World Sugar Research Organisation, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, Mars, and corn syrup giant Archer Daniels Midland (and that is just a single scientist’s list of funding sources).781 The concern shouldn’t paralyze our efforts, but it should serve up a healthy dose of humility when considering policy proposals.782

How about releasing a video game for kids that promotes fruit? Sounds good, right? Well, what do you think happened when kids were seated in front of bowls of fruit and candy, and randomized to play one of three different computer “advergames” (advertising-game hybrids incorporating product placements) that promoted either candy, fruit, or toys? The pro-candy game group ate more candy, but, disappointingly, the pro-fruit group didn’t eat more fruit. Then it got interesting. The kids in the pro-fruit group also ate more candy. Compared to the pro-toy control group, having a kid play a video game promoting fruit led them to eat more candy. Presumably both the candy and fruit games just made the kids think about food, and they naturally gravitated to their preferred snacks.783

****************************************************************************************************
Among the most fascinating phenomena I’ve come across is the boomerang effect of “remedy messaging.” One might presume that the advertising of smoking cessation aids like nicotine gum would help make quitting easier. After all, the vast majority of smokers want to quit,784 so availing them of helpful options couldn’t help but help, right? Instead, such remedy marketing can create a vicarious get-out-of-jail-free card that ends up reinforcing risky behavior. Exposure to nicotine replacement product advertising was found to undermine quitting intentions, especially among the heaviest smokers, the very ones who needed it the most. The thought is that smokers may subconsciously interpret the remedy as evidence that the hazards of smoking are more manageable and, therefore, less risky, which thereby helps to justify their habit.785

You can see how easily this would translate to the weight-loss arena. We explored how self-licensing could cause those taking slimming supplements to inadvertently eat more, but merely being exposed to an ad for a “fat-fighting pill” appeared to have a similar type of effect. So even when companies are ostensibly selling health rather than disease, they still may be inadvertently making the problem worse. And in the marketplace, there’s just no incentive for risk-avoidance messaging. Nobody makes money selling just say no unless it can somehow be linked to salable products and services.786

A policy in France—where burgers now outsell baguettes787—may represent an interesting real-world example of the counterintuitive remedy-messaging effect. Industry lobbying took a valiant effort to ban the advertising of junk and morphed it into a mandate for preventive health messaging on junk food advertisements.788 On products like Lay’s Chips Saveur Poulet Rôti (chicken-flavored potato chips), you’ll now see messages like Pour votre santé, pratiquez une activité physique régulière (For your health, practice regular physical activity).789 Sounds good, right? Not so fast. Anytime an industry agrees to a regulation, one should get skeptical as to its effectiveness.

To see if such messaging might lead to a boomerang effect, research subjects were randomized to view a Big Mac advertisement with or without the preventive health message For your health, eat at least five fruits and vegetables per day. (After all, wouldn’t it be great if McDonald’s were forced to advertise healthy food?) The subjects then filled out a general questionnaire and, before they left, were allowed to choose one of two McDonald’s coupons as a reward for their participation: a free sundae or a free bag of fruit.790 Guess who was more likely to pick the fruit?

Only one in three who had just seen the straight burger advertisement, the one without the preventive health message, chose the fruit over the sundae, but that number fell to only about one in six among those who had been prompted to eat healthier.791 Isn’t that wild? The absence of the healthy message doubled the number of people choosing the healthy snack. The health message made things worse. This may be the remedy-messaging boomerang effect in action. Simultaneously offering a temptation with a reminder about how they can dig themselves out justifies the excuse to indulge. Subconsciously, it may give the chicken-y chip eater the rationalization that they can just work it off the next day at the gym, even if that day never comes.

The recommended antidote to avoid justification effects is to instead use negative framing.792 That is, instead of offering a way out to compensate for indulging “just this one time,” cautionary messages may be more effective. For example, imagine reading Pour votre santé, évitez de manger trop gras, trop sucré, trop salé (For your health, avoid foods that are too fatty, too sweet, or too salty) on your next chocolate-filled or ham-and-cheese croissant. That’s a message for which I doubt Le McDonald’s would be quite as enthusiastic.

****************************************************************************************************

Both BMI and waist circumference can be used to predict the risk of death due to excess body fat,492 but even at the same BMI, there appears to be nearly a straight-line increase in mortality risk with widening waistlines.493 Someone with “normal-weight central obesity”—meaning someone not even considered to be overweight according to BMI, but who carries fat around the middle494—may have up to twice the risk of dying compared to someone who’s overweight or obese according to their weight and height. This is why the World Health Organization,495 National Institutes of Health,496 and American Heart Association497 recommend measuring both BMI and waist circumference. This may be especially important for older women, who lose approximately 13 pounds of bone and muscle as they age from twenty-five to sixty-five, while quadrupling their visceral fat stores. (Men’s visceral fat stores tend only to double.)498 So even if a woman doesn’t gain any weight according to the bathroom scale, she may be gaining fat.

What’s the healthy waistline cutoff? 499 Increased risk of metabolic complications starts at an abdominal circumference of 31.5 inches in women and 37 inches in most men, but closer to 35.5 inches for Chinese, Japanese, and South Asian men.500 The benchmark for substantially increased risk starts at about 34.5 inches for women and 40 inches for men.501 Once you get greater than an abdominal circumference of about 43 inches in men, mortality rates shoot up about 50 percent compared to men with 8-inch-smaller stomachs, and women suffer 80 percent greater mortality risk at 37.5-inch waists compared to 27.5 inches.502 The reading of a measuring tape may translate into years off one’s life span.

Surprisingly, there is no universal protocol for assessing waist circumference. Some guidelines recommend measuring at the level of the last rib, others at the top of the hip bones, and others still suggest halfway between those landmarks, or at the belly button, or at the narrowest point.503 While the belly button may be the most intuitive and easiest to measure (and the preferred location for a one-time visceral fat assessment),504 the halfway point between the top of the hip bones and bottom of the rib cage appears to be the most effective at tracking changes in visceral fat over time.

****************************************************************************************************
KEEP YOUR WAIST LESS THAN HALF YOUR HEIGHT

Unlike waist circumference, body mass index has the advantage of taking height into account. Waist-to-height ratio may offer the best of both worlds, and the cutoff value is the simplest to remember: Keep your waist less than half your height.506 The goal for adults and children six years or older is to get a waist-to-height ratio under 0.5.507

Waist-to-height ratio may be a better predictor of both body fat percentage and visceral fat mass than BMI or waist circumference alone.508 In terms of screening for cardiometabolic risk (for example, heart disease and diabetes), waist-to-height ratio appears superior to BMI in adults509 and seems to work as well as BMI for assessing body fat in children.510 So the ideal may be a combination of BMI and a measure of abdominal obesity, such as waist-to-height ratio.

****************************************************************************************************

The difficulty of curing obesity has been compared to learning a foreign language; it’s an achievement virtually anyone can attain with a sufficient investment of energies, but it always takes considerable time and effort.514 Research suggests that most obese individuals don’t stay in treatment. Of those who do, most don’t adhere to it sufficiently to lose the excess weight. But, even among those who try to stick with it, most will regain much of the weight.515 To me, this speaks to the difficulty, rather than the futility. It may take smokers an average of thirty quit attempts to finally kick the habit.516 Like quitting smoking, it helps to think of losing excess weight as just something that has to be done. As the chair of the Association for the Study of Obesity put it, it doesn’t take willpower to do essential tasks like getting up at night to feed a baby—it’s just something that has to be done.517

For a smoker, in order to overcome addiction, it takes an average of 30 tries. If for a smoker it takes 30 times, how much for food ? You should keep this in mind. You need to take this in consideration and not quit easily.

//*************************** Hedonism *****************************
In Pursuit of Pleasure

The idea of preventive health is that you do something now so that nothing bad happens later. You floss your teeth not because it makes you feel better but because, by doing so, one day you won’t feel worse. You could consider the healthy habits described in this book to be preventive—you eat a healthier diet now to avoid disease later.

A healthy diet, however, does more than that.

The food industries bank their billions by manipulating the pleasure centers within your brain, the so-called dopamine reward system. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter the brain evolved to reward you for good behavior, helping to motivate your drive for things like food, water, and sex—all necessary for the perpetuation of our species. This natural response has been and continues to be perverted for profit.

The food industry, like the tobacco companies and other drug lords, has been able to come up with products that tap into the same dopamine reward system that keeps people smoking cigarettes and snorting cocaine. People have chewed coca leaves for at least eight thousand years without any evidence of addiction,4 but a problem arises when certain components are isolated and 
concentrated into cocaine—when the coca leaves are processed. The same may be true for sugar. After all, few people binge on bananas. The isolation of sugar from the whole food may be the reason you’re more likely to supersize soda than sweet potatoes or why you’re unlikely to eat too much corn on the cob but can’t seem to get enough high-fructose corn syrup.

The overconsumption of sugar-sweetened foods has often been compared to drug addiction. Until very recently, this parallel was based more on anecdotal evidence than on solid scientific grounds. But now we have PET scans, imaging technology that allows doctors to measure brain activity in real time. It all started with a study that showed decreased dopamine sensitivity in obese individuals. The more the individual being studied weighed, the less responsive to dopamine he or she appeared to be.5 We see the same reduction in sensitivity in cocaine addicts and alcoholics.6 The brain gets so overstimulated that it ends up trying to turn down the volume.

It was healthy and adaptive for our primate brains to drive us to eat that banana when there wasn’t much food around, but now that fruit is available in fruit loop form, this evolutionary adaptation has become a liability.7 The original Coca-Cola formulation actually included coca leaf, but now, perhaps, its sugar content may be the addictive stand-in.

The brain responds similarly to fat. Within thirty minutes of being fed yogurt packed with butterfat, research subjects exhibited similar brain activity8 to those who drank straight sugar water.9 People who regularly eat ice cream (sugar and fat) have a deadened dopamine response in their brains when drinking a milkshake. It’s comparable to the way drug abusers have to use more and more drugs to obtain the same high. A neuroimaging study found that frequent ice cream consumption “is related to a reduction in reward-region [pleasure center] responsivity in humans, paralleling the tolerance observed in drug addiction.” Once you’ve so dulled your dopamine response, you may subsequently overeat in an effort to achieve the degree of gratification experienced previously, contributing to unhealthy weight gain.

***************************************************************************************
What do fatty and sugary foods have in common? They are both energy dense. It may be less about the number of calories than their concentration. Consumption of green-light foods, which are naturally calorie dilute, doesn’t lead to a deadened dopamine response, but a calorie-dense diet with the same number of calories does.11 It’s like the difference between cocaine and crack: It’s the same stuff chemically, but by smoking crack cocaine, a user can deliver a higher dose more quickly to his or her brain.

Given our new understanding of the biological basis of food addiction, there have been calls to include obesity as an official mental disorder.12 After all, both obesity and addiction share the inability to restrain behavior in spite of an awareness of detrimental health consequences, one of the defining criteria of substance abuse (a phenomenon referred to as the “pleasure trap”).13 Of course, redefining obesity as an addiction would be a boon to the pharmaceutical companies that are already working on a whole array of drugs to muck with your brain chemistry.14

For example, when researchers tried giving an opiate blocker to binge eaters (similar to how heroin addicts are sometimes treated with opiate blockers to minimize the narcotic’s effects), the binge eaters ate significantly fewer fatty and sugary snacks—the snacks just didn’t seem to do as much for them when their opiate receptors were blocked.15 In addition to new drugs, addiction specialists have urged that the food industry “should be given incentives to develop low calorie foods that are more attractive, palatable and affordable so that people can adhere to diet programs for a long time.”16 No need—Mother Nature beat them to it. That’s what the produce aisle is for.

****************************************************
Rather than taking drugs, you can prevent the numbing of your pleasure center in the first place by sticking to green-light foods. This can help return your dopamine sensitivity to normal levels so that you can again derive the same pleasure from the simplest of foods. When you regularly eat calorie-dense animal products and junk foods like ice cream, it’s not just your taste buds that change but your brain chemistry. After eating a bunch of candy bars, not only may a ripe peach no longer taste as sweet on your tongue but 
your brain down-regulates dopamine receptors to compensate for the repeated jolts of fat and sugar. In fact, an overly rich diet could cause you to experience less enjoyment from other activities as well.

There is a reason cocaine addicts appear to have an impaired neurological capacity for sexual stimulation17 and why smokers have an impaired ability to respond to positive stimuli.18 Related brain circuits wire all these sensations. Since they all involve overlapping dopamine pathways, what you put into your body—what you eat and what you drink—can affect how you experience all of life’s pleasures. Try it and see. Try it and feel.

Do you see where I’m going with this?

Eating a whole-food, plant-based diet and returning your brain’s dopamine sensitivity to its healthy, normal levels can help you live life to the fullest and allow you to experience greater joy, satisfaction, and pleasure from all the things you do—not just what you eat.


// What happens when you switch to whole food plant based
Within 1-2 hours: not only will inflammation levels drop but symptoms of diabetes will
be easier to manage there’s a pro-inflammatory signalling molecule in our bodies called interleukin-18
which can play a role destabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and it is a Strong Predictor of Cardiovascular
Death.

In this study interleukin-18 levels inflammation in the body changed after a single meal participants
who ate the plant based meal had around a 20% drop in IL-18 levels within hours.

Every time we eat a wholefood plant based meal, the fiber helps to keep our blood sugar
in check which helps our body burn fuel steadily rather than causing our insulin to spike.

Plants also help the body to make healthy amounts of insulin after eating.
Then quote “Within a few days of starting a whole-food, plant-based diet, you may be
able to significantly reduce your insulin dose or medication,” says Dr Hana Kahleova.

Now this study backs up these findings.
Researchers compared the effects of a plant-based meal to a meal containing meat on participants
with type 2 diabetes.

The results show that participants’ postprandial secretion of insulin increased more after
the plant-based meal than the meat-based meal. Secretion of incretin hormones, particularly glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1), also increased more after the vegan meal.

Incretin hormones amplify the release of insulin after a meal and also help decrease blood
glucose levels.

Beta-cell function parameters also improved after the vegan meal.
Beta cells synthesize, store, and release insulin.
Beta-cell function is typically diminished in those who have diabetes, and preserving beta cells’ capacity to produce insulin is a cornerstone in the treatment of diabetes.

Then Within 1 week: Your cholesterol will be lower.
In The Game Changers documentary after just one week of eating only plants, the firefighters
experiences a drop in their cholesterol.

According to cardiologist Dr Joel Kahn “A total immersion into a whole-food plant diet
can result in a rapid drop in your total cholesterol as much as 100 mg/dl," Again changes can be
so dramatic that as with all the information we share in this video any changes you make
to your diet should be discussed with your doctor first.

Within 1-2 weeks your blood pressure may drop back to normal.
Dr Joel Kahn says quote "A single week of eating a totally plant diet consisting of
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can often reduce blood pressure by 10 mmHg
or more and allow medications to be reduced.

Some people might even be able to cut their meds within a few days, or weeks, under doctor
supervision."

This is again backed up by science as researchers showed that Participants in this study saw
their blood pressure drop 19 points, on average, after just 14 days.
Within 1 - 2 weeks: You'll get slimmer!

In PCRM studies, average weight loss after transitioning to a whole-food, plant-based diet is about a pound a week.
Some people, however, may lose two or three pounds a week.
According to Dr Kahleova quote 'That means that after one year, you could be some 52 pounds lighter, with only one change.

These statements are also backed up by numerous studies.
Within 2 - 3 weeks: chest pain could diminish.
Heart disease can bring on angina, or chest pain.

According to Dr Joel Kahn patients have dramatically reversed symptoms of heart disease in as little
as three weeks on a plant based diet.
“You can experience rapid, profound changes including angina symptoms dropping by as much
as 90 percent.
More and more case reports are confirming this finding.
Within 1-2 months: Your unhealthy TMAO levels will fall.

Eating red meat and egg yolks can cause a spike in unhealthy gut molecules Called TrimethylamineN -oxide.
“TMAO promotes clogged arteries, organ scarring, and blood clotting and predicts a worrisome
outcome in many disease states,” says Dr. Kahn, When you switch to a wholefood plant
based diet abnormal TMAO levels can return to normal in as little as four weeks.
Within 6 weeks erectile dysfunction and sexual dysfunction can disappear.

We all remember those striking experiments from the documentary The Game Changers on
improvement in sexual function.

If you haven't seen the film I highly recommend going to watch it!
Improvement can be seen anywhere from one to six weeks according to Dr Caldwell Esselstyn.
This is due to dramatic improvement in circulation as the same circulatory system that blocks
arteries can also affect the smaller vascularity below your waist.

This is again backed up by research and may also true for women too as sexual function
in women is also significantly affected by atherosclerotic narrowing of blood flow through
the arteries, including the arteries that supply the pelvis.

Within 1 year: Your arteries will be less clogged.
When you switch to a whole food plant based diet clogging and hardening of the arteries
can be stopped in its tracks.
Then as time goes on the blood vessels can recover significantly and narrowing and constrictions
begins to open up, in many cases.

Taking Responsibility

My goal is to give you the information to empower and inspire you to make healthy changes in your life, but in the end, it’s all up to you. Know, however, that there is only one way of eating that’s ever been proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients, a diet centered around whole plant foods. Anytime anyone tries to sell you on some new diet, ask just one simple question: “Has it been proven to reverse heart disease?” (You know, the most likely cause of death for you and everyone you love?) If it hasn’t, why would you even consider it?

If that’s all a whole-food, plant-based diet could do—reverse our number-one killer—then shouldn’t that be the default diet until proven otherwise? And the fact that it can also be effective in preventing, treating, and arresting other leading killers would seem to make the case for eating this way overwhelming. Please give it a try.

It could save your life.

How Not to Die may seem to you a strange title for a book. After all, everyone is going to die eventually. It’s about how not to die prematurely. If there is one takeaway message, it’s that you have tremendous power over your health destiny. The vast majority of premature deaths can be prevented with simple changes in what you eat and how you live.

In other words, a long and healthy life is largely a matter of choice. In 2015, Dr. Kim Williams became president of the American College of Cardiology. He was asked why he chose to eat a strictly plant-based diet. “I don’t mind dying,” Dr. Williams said. “I just don’t want it to be my fault.”19

That’s what this book is about: taking responsibility for your and your family’s health.



//************************************************************************************
**************************************************************************************
Supplements

By getting your nutrients from green-light foods, not only will you minimize exposure to harmful food components, such as sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol, but you will maximize your intake of nearly every required nutrient: vitamin A carotenoids; vitamin C; vitamin E; the B vitamins, including thiamin, riboflavin, and folate; as well as magnesium, iron, and potassium, not to mention fiber.1 Dietary quality rating scales consistently rank the most-plant-based diets as the healthiest.2

That said, because of the way we live in our modern world, there are important shortfalls that need to be corrected.

For example, vitamin B12 is not made by plants; it’s made by microbes that blanket the earth. But in this sanitized modern world, we now chlorinate the water supply to kill off any bacteria. While you don’t get much B12 in the water anymore, you don’t get much cholera, either—that’s a good thing! Similarly, we evolved to make all the vitamin D we need from the sun, but most of us are no longer running around naked in equatorial Africa. You may be covered up, inside, at a high northern latitude and therefore need to supplement your diet with this “sunshine vitamin.” Thus, these two vitamins must be addressed.

2,500 mcg (µg) Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) at Least Once a Week

Given modern sanitary standards, a regular, reliable source of vitamin B12 is critical for anyone eating a plant-based diet.3 Though deficiency for those starting out with adequate stores may take years to develop,4 the results of B12 deficiency can be devastating, with cases reported of paralysis,5 psychosis,6 blindness,7 and even death.8 Newborn infants of mothers who eat a plant-based diet and who fail to supplement can develop deficiency much more rapidly with disastrous results.9

For adults under age sixty-five, the easiest way to get B12 is to take at least one 2,500 mcg supplement each week. If you take too much, you merely get expensive pee. Well, not all that expensive: A five-year supply of vitamin B12 can cost less than twenty dollars.10 If you’d rather get into the habit of taking it daily, the once-a-day dosing is 250 mcg.11 Note that these doses are specific to cyanocobalamin, the preferred supplemental form of vitamin B12, as there is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of the other forms, like methylcobalamin.12

As you age, your ability to absorb vitamin B12 may decline.13 For those over sixty-five who eat plant-based diets, the supplementation should probably be increased from at least 2,500 mcg a week (or 250 mcg a day) up to 1,000 mcg of cyanocobalamin each day.14,15

Instead of taking B12 supplements, it’s possible to get sufficient amounts from B12-fortified foods, but you would have to eat three servings a day of foods providing at least 25 percent of the Daily Value (on the Nutrition Facts label),16 with each serving eaten at least four to six hours after the last.17 The only green-light source I’m aware of is B12-fortified nutritional yeast, for which two teaspoons three times a day would suffice. For most people, though, it would probably be cheaper and more convenient to just take a supplement.

My other supplement recommendations in this section can be considered conditional, but getting enough vitamin B12 is absolutely nonnegotiable for those centering their diets around green-light foods.

Vitamin D from Sun or Supplements

I recommend that people unable to get sufficient sun take one 2,000 IU vitamin D3 supplement each day,18 ideally with the largest meal of the day.19

In the northern hemisphere, below approximately 30° latitude (south of Los Angeles, Dallas, or Atlanta), fifteen minutes each day of midday sun on the forearms and face without sunblock should produce sufficient vitamin D for Caucasians under the age of sixty. Those who have darker skin20 or who are older21 may require thirty minutes or more.

Farther north, at 40° latitude (Portland, Chicago, or New York City), the sun’s rays are at such an angle during the months of November through February that vitamin D may not be produced. No matter how long you might sunbathe naked in Times Square on New Year’s Day, you won’t make any vitamin D.22

Above 50° latitude (around London, Berlin, Moscow, and Edmonton, Canada), this “vitamin D winter” may extend for as long as six months of the year.

Vitamin D supplements are therefore recommended for people at higher latitudes during the winter months and year-round for those not getting enough midday sun, regardless of location. This may also apply to those living in smoggy cities, such as Los Angeles or San Diego.23

I do not recommend tanning beds. They can be both ineffective24 and dangerous.25 The lamps emit mostly UVA,26 which increases melanoma skin cancer risk without producing vitamin D.27

Eat Iodine-Rich Foods

Iodine, a mineral essential for thyroid function, is found predominantly in the ocean and in variable amounts in the soils of the world. To ensure everyone was getting enough, table salt was fortified with the mineral starting in the 1920s. So if you do add salt to your food, use iodized salt (not sea salt or “natural” salt, which contains about sixty times less iodine28). Given that sodium is considered the second-leading dietary killer in the world,29 however, iodized salt should be considered a red-light source.

There are two yellow-light sources of iodine: seafood and dairy milk. (Iodine leaches into the milk from iodine-containing antiseptic chemicals used to disinfect the cow’s teats to prevent mastitis.30) The most concentrated green-light source is seaweed, which has the iodine of seafood without the fat-soluble pollutants that build up in the aquatic food chain.

Sea vegetables are the underwater dark-green leafies. I encourage you to experiment with ways to include them in your diet. The recommended daily intake of iodine is 150 mcg, which is what is in about two sheets of nori,31 the seaweed that’s used to make sushi. There are all sorts of seaweed snacks on the market now, but most, if not all of them, seem to have added red-light ingredients. So I buy plain nori and season the sheets myself by brushing them with jarred pickled ginger juice and lightly sprinkling on wasabi powder before recrisping them at 300°F for about five minutes.

Sprinkling just a half teaspoon of the seaweeds arame or dulse onto dishes you’re preparing may also get you your iodine for the day. Dulse is sold as pretty purple flakes you can just shake onto your food. I do caution against hijiki32 (also spelled hiziki), because it has been found to be contaminated with arsenic. I also caution against kelp, which may have too much iodine; just a half teaspoon of kelp could exceed the daily upper limit. For the same reason, you shouldn’t get into a regular habit of eating more than fifteen sheets of nori or more than a tablespoon of arame or dulse a day.33 Too much iodine can cause excessive thyroid gland activity.34

For those who don’t like seaweed, Eden brand’s canned beans have a tiny amount of kelp added such that iodine levels average between 36.3 mcg per half-cup serving (great northern beans) to 71.2 mcg (navy beans).35 Not only are those levels safe—you’d have to eat about twenty cans a day to get too much—but checkmarking my three legume servings a day with Eden’s beans would fulfill your daily iodine requirement.

One last note about iodine: Although people who avoid seafood and dairy products do not appear to have impaired thyroid function,36,37 I would not leave it to chance during pregnancy, where iodine is critical for proper brain development.38 I agree with the American Thyroid Association’s recommendation that all North American pregnant and breast-feeding women receive a prenatal vitamin containing 150 mcg of iodine daily.39

Consider Taking 250 mg of Pollutant-Free (Yeast- or Algae-Derived) Long-Chain Omega-3s Daily

According to two of the most credible nutrition authorities, the World Health Organization and the European Food Safety Authority, you should get at least a half a percent of your calories from the short-chain omega-3 ALA.40 That’s easy—the one Daily Dozen tablespoon of ground flaxseeds takes care of that. Your body can then take the short-chain omega-3 from flaxseeds (or chia seeds or walnuts) and elongate it into the long-chain omega-3s EPA and DHA found in fish fat. The question, however, is whether the body can make enough for optimal brain health.41,42 Until we know more, I recommend taking 250 mg of pollutant-free long-chain omega-3s directly.

I don’t recommend fish oil, since even purified (“distilled”) fish oil has been found to be contaminated with considerable amounts of PCBs and other pollutants, so much so that taken as directed, salmon, herring, and tuna oils would exceed the tolerable daily intake of toxicity.43 This may help explain the studies that found adverse effects of fish consumption on cognitive function in both adults and children. But many of those studies either were done downstream of a gold-mining area contaminated with mercury, which is used in the mining process,44 or included people who ate whale meat or fish caught next to chemical plants or toxic spills.45 What about fish you’d just get at a restaurant or grocery store?

An elite group of Floridians (mostly corporate executives) was studied. They ate so much seafood that at least 43 percent exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s safety limit for mercury, and it appeared to have an effect. The researchers found that excessive seafood intake, which they defined as more than around three to four servings per month of such fish as tuna or snapper, elevates mercury levels and appeared to cause cognitive dysfunction. The effect wasn’t large—only about a 5 percent drop in cognitive performance—but “a decrement [in executive function] that no one, let alone a health-conscious and achievement-oriented person, is likely to welcome.”46

Thankfully, you can get the benefits without the risks by getting long-chain omega-3s from algae instead,47 which is where the fish primarily get it from to begin with.48 By cutting out the middle-fish and getting EPA and DHA directly from the source at the bottom of the food chain, you don’t have to worry about pollutant contamination. In fact, the algae used for supplements are just grown in tanks and never even come in contact with the ocean.49 That’s why I recommend a contaminant-free source to get the best of both worlds, omega-3 levels associated with brain preservation50 and minimized exposure to industrial pollutants.

What About…?

All the other vitamins, minerals, and nutrients should be taken care of by the mountains of nutrition you’ll be getting by centering your diet around whole plant foods. And many of those nutrients are ones Americans normally don’t get in sufficient quantity—namely, vitamins A, C, and E and the minerals magnesium and potassium, along with fiber.51 Ninety-three percent of Americans don’t get enough vitamin E. Ninety-seven percent of American adults don’t get enough fiber.52 Ninety-eight percent of American diets are deficient in potassium.53 You, my friend, are going to be the one in a thousand who does it right.

If you have a specific question about some obscure nutrient—like, “What about my molybdenum or menaquinones?”—rather than have me bore everyone else with minutiae, allow me to refer you to the best reference book available on plant-based nutrition by the preeminent dietitians Brenda Davis and Vesanto Melina.54 The authors go into great detail and even have chapters on pregnancy, breast-feeding, and raising bouncing boys and girls.

Vitamin B12-fortified plant-based diets can offer health benefits for all stages of the life cycle.55 Dr. Benjamin Spock, the most esteemed pediatrician of all time, wrote perhaps the bestselling American book of the twentieth century: The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care. In the seventh edition, the final one before Dr. Spock died at ninety-four, he advocated children be raised on a plant-based diet with no exposure to meat or dairy products. Dr. Spock had lived long enough to see the beginnings of the childhood obesity epidemic. “Children who grow up getting their nutrition from plant foods,” he wrote, “have a tremendous health advantage and are much less likely to develop health problems as the years go by.”56


// B12 ************************* Very important ********************* Mandatory **********
Mandatory for plant based diets. Supplementation of b12 is required.
For pregnancy, infants, children and elderly different dosages are required.


50 mcg(μg, micro grams a day) if your absorption is normal
at least 2000 mcg a week chewable, sublingual

Those over 65 years should take 1000 mcg a day because absorption is low.

B12 is from bacteria, not plants. The more hygienic we eat, the less we have it.
WFPBD can put you at risk for b12 deficiency because plants don't make b12.

Take Cyanocobalamin on an empty stomach, not mixed with other foods, vitamins or minerals. An hour before or after a meal.
Don't take b12 that is in the same pill with other vitamins or minerals. They will create b12 analogs that can be potentially harmful. They can inhibit the transport of what little b12 you have. Vitamin C and copper degrade b12.

Sublingual or chewable is best for absorptioin.

Cyanocobalamin has a track record of safety and efficacy. Best suited for oral supplementation.
Cyanocobalamin (b12) is the best as long as you have normal renal function. If you have impaired kidney function then Methylcobalamin. If you take Methylcobalamin double the normal dose if you have impaired kidney function.

Carnitine is produced by animals, we produce it too. No need for ingestion from meat, but some are deficient(their enzymes are not producing enough) and don't know it because they are eating meat. When they switch to plant food they get low energy levels, that's why tests should be made. There are supplements, and if your energy comes back, that's it.


//******************************* High animal protein *******************
High animal protein consumption increases cortisol levels and reduces testosterone levels. When natural bodybuilders were tested, testosterone went down below normal levels before a competition(up to 75% percent). They eat protein to make them look manly on the outside, but makes you less manly on the inside. Which is bad because testosterone is a strong antidepressant. A decrease in testosterone makes you gain weight. High cortisol may lead to obesity.

Obesity and cortisol in women
Rapid onset of excess body fat and, ultimately, obesity may therefore represent the price paid to compensate for chronic stress exposure. If they are pregnant, consumption of high animal products leads to high levels of cortisol, which, in turn affect the developing fetus, resetting its developing hypothalamic-pitutiary-adrenal axis(basically resetting their stress level thermostat). This leads to higher levels of cortisol for their whole life, with serious health consequences. People with high cortisol react more negatively at what life throws at them. Women put through Trier social stress test, had exaggerated stress response.
The nasty part is that after the test if you give people their on private snack buffet with fruits and veggies but also fat, sugary comfort foods like chocolate cake. Guess who eats the junk food, the ones with the high chronic stress levels. Cortisol can make you eat even when you are not really hungry.

No current data suggest that the general population should try to avoid gluten, but for those with celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or a wheat sensitivity diagnosis, gluten-free diets can be a lifesaver.

The bottom line? Yes, nuts are high in calories, but through a combination of dietary compensation mechanisms, your body’s failure to absorb some of the fat, and increased fat-burning metabolism, nuts can be a lifeline without expanding your waistline.

// Ceylon cinnamon is the safe one

There are two main types of cinnamon: Ceylon cinnamon and cassia cinnamon (also known as Chinese cinnamon). In the United States, anything simply labeled “cinnamon” is probably cassia, since it’s cheaper. This is unfortunate, because cassia contains a compound called coumarin, which may be toxic to the liver at high doses. Unless it’s specifically labeled Ceylon cinnamon, a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon even a few times a week may be too much for small children, and a daily teaspoon would exceed the tolerable upper safety limit for adults.

Tea

Black, green, and white teas are all made from the leaves of the same evergreen shrub. Herbal tea, on the other hand, involves pouring hot water over any plant in the world other than the tea plant.

What’s so special about the tea bush? Phytonutrients exclusive to the tea plant appear so powerful that they can reverse disease even when merely applied to the skin. For example, the topical application of green tea in ointment form on genital warts results in an astounding 100 percent clearance in more than half the patients tested.56 It’s no wonder that this wonder treatment is now officially incorporated into the Centers for Disease Control STD Treatment Guidelines.57 There was even a remarkable case report of a woman whose skin cancers were apparently stopped with topical green tea application.58 If green tea can do that on the outside of your body, what might it be able to do internally?

I already discussed the role green tea may play in breast cancer prevention in chapter 11. Drinking tea may protect against gynecological malignancies, such as ovarian cancer59 and endometrial cancer,60 as well as lower your cholesterol,61 blood pressure,62 blood sugar,63 and body fat.64 It may protect the brain from both cognitive decline65 and stroke.66 Tea consumption is also associated with decreased risk of diabetes,67 tooth loss,68 and up to half the risk of dying from pneumonia.69 Those who suffer from seasonal allergies may also benefit from drinking tea. Randomized trials have shown that drinking about three cups of Japanese Benifuuki green tea per day starting six70 to ten71 weeks before pollen season significantly reduces allergy symptoms. That’s nothing to sneeze at!

Riding the Waves

The invention of the electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure brain-wave activity has been described as “one of the most surprising, remarkable, and momentous developments in the history of clinical neurology.”72 Scientists discovered that humans have four main mental states—two while sleeping and two while awake. Delta waves, in which your brain is electrically pulsing slowly at about one wave per second, are typically only seen in deep sleep. Then there’s theta-wave sleep. At about five cycles per second, this mental state occurs when you’re dreaming. The two waking states are alpha and beta. The alpha state is relaxed, aware, and attentive, such as when you close your eyes and meditate. Beta, meanwhile, is the stimulated, hustle-and-bustle state in which most of us live our lives.

Alpha, however, is where you want to be—fully alert and focused, yet calm. How do you get there? If you relax in a pleasant, peaceful place, after about ninety minutes, you can start to generate some significant alpha activity (though such practicing meditators as Buddhist monks can achieve this state much earlier and maintain it even with their eyes open). To acquire this talent, you could meditate every day for a few years—or you could just drink some tea. Within minutes of tea consumption, anyone may be able to attain that same relaxed but alert brain-wave pattern.73 That dramatic alteration in brain activity may explain why tea is the world’s single most popular beverage after water.

Both white and green teas are less processed than black tea and are probably preferable.74 White tea is made from young leaves and is named after the silvery-white hairs on the immature buds; green tea is made from more mature leaves. Which tea is healthier? The answer seems to depend on whether or not you add lemon. If you drink your tea without lemon, green tea appears preferable to white tea. But if you add lemon, white tea jumps ahead.75 The reason is that while there are more phytonutrients in white tea, they may only be released at a certain pH level.76

In terms of cancer prevention potential, both green and white teas have been shown to protect against DNA damage in vitro against PhIP, the cooked-meat carcinogen I described in chapter 11. White tea won out, though, blocking upward of 100 percent of DNA damage compared to green tea, which at the same concentration only blocked about half. The “potent antimutagenic activity of white tea in comparison with green tea” was achieved at a brewing time of one minute. For most of the teas tested, steeping longer than a minute had no additional effect. In terms of antioxidant activity, though, it may be better not to brew at all.77

Cold-steeping is a popular way to prepare tea in Taiwan, especially during the summer months. Cold-steeped tea is not like conventional iced tea, in which you brew your tea hot and then cool it down. Rather, cold-steeping involves tossing the tea in cold water and letting it sit at room temperature or in the fridge for at least two hours. This method has been found to reduce the caffeine content and is said to reduce bitterness and improve the aroma.78 But what does cold-steeping do to the nutrient content? You would think that cold water wouldn’t draw out as many antioxidants. After all, nutrient extraction is presumably the whole point of brewing tea with hot water, right? A group of scientists took it upon themselves to compare the antioxidant activity of hot- versus cold-steeped tea. Essentially, they mixed LDL (“bad”) cholesterol with free radicals and timed how long it took the cholesterol to oxidize in the presence of both hot- and cold-steeped tea.

In a surprise upset, cold-steeped white tea was significantly better at slowing down oxidation.79 (No significant effect of brewing temperature on the antioxidant activity of green tea was found.) The researchers surmised that traditional tea water is so hot that it manages to destroy some of the more sensitive antioxidants in white tea. I no longer brew my tea; I just let it sit overnight in the fridge. Cold-steeping saves prep time and energy, and may even be healthier.

You don’t have to care how much nutrition is extracted from tea leaves, though, if you simply eat them. Matcha is powdered green tea, produced by milling whole tea leaves into a fine powder that can be added straight to water. Why waste nutrition by dumping a tea bag when you’re done, when you can drink the leaves instead? Think of it this way: Drinking steeped tea is akin to boiling a pot of collard greens and then throwing away the veggies and just drinking the cooking water. Sure, some of the nutrition leached into the water, but wouldn’t it be better to eat the leaves themselves? That’s why I now just throw whole tea leaves straight into my smoothies (see here). This is also a great way to incorporate tea in your diet if drinking tea on an empty stomach causes discomfort. If you develop a taste for matcha (I find it a bit grassy), you can carry around little packets of it wherever you go and just put some in your water bottle and shake. For essentially zero calories, you can drink dark-green leafies all day.

If green tea is so good, why not just take green-tea extract pills? Because of dozens of reported cases of liver toxicity linked to their use80—yet another demonstration that it’s better to eat the whole food than some glorified “active ingredient” concentrate. There is one tea beverage I’d stay away from, though. Based on a few cases of serious, life-threatening outcomes linked to kombucha tea, a type of fermented tea, the consumption of kombucha “should be discouraged,” according to one case report of a person who ended up in a coma after drinking the stuff.81

Are there any caveats to regular tea consumption? The fluoride content of tea appears to be the limiting factor. The tea plant naturally concentrates fluoride from the soil, which is one of the reasons tea consumption may help fight cavities,82 but too much fluoride can be toxic. A recent case reported in the New England Journal of Medicine described a woman who started experiencing bone pain after seventeen years of habitually consuming a pitcher of tea made from 100 to 150 tea bags daily.83 That’s too much.

To prevent skeletal fluorosis, adults should probably not drink more than about twenty tea bags’ worth of black tea a day for twenty years straight, or thirty bags of green daily, or eighty bags of white tea a day.84 To prevent dental fluorosis, a harmless but unsightly mottled tooth discoloration, children should probably refrain from drinking more than about three bags of black tea a day (or around four bags of green or twelve of white)85 while their teeth are still developing, up until around age nine.86

Alpha relaxers

Since alpha waves are linked with relaxed mental states, many experts believe increasing alpha activity may help reduce stress and anxiety, as well as help you stay relaxed. Scientists writing in the journal Cortex have also provided evidence that enhancing alpha waves may boost creativity by an average of 7.4% (creative people are indeed thought to have increased alpha activity).

The same researchers also claim there’s strong evidence that people with depression have impaired alpha activity – this, they say, suggests improving alpha brain patterns may be a potential way of treating low mood.

Here are some of the things you can do to get into the alpha zone:

Learn to meditate

Many experts claim practicing meditation daily can help boost alpha activity in the brain.

Close your eyes

Each time you close your eyes – especially when you’re doing some visualisation – your brain produces higher levels of alpha waves.


Take a deep breath

Deep breathing exercises can also boost your alpha waves. Try sitting comfortably, and breathe in gently through your nose and out through your mouth to a slow count of five.

Have a relaxing bath

If you can close your eyes and switch off while soaking in the tub, you know what it’s like to generate alpha waves.

Try some yoga

… or indeed any activity that relaxes you, such as listening to soothing music, painting, drawing (try adult colouring books if you’re not a natural artist) or having a massage.

More than two-thirds of American adults are overweight.1 Think about that. Fewer than one in three people maintain a healthy weight. What’s more, by 2030, more than half the country’s population may be clinically obese. Over the last three decades, childhood obesity has tripled, and most overweight kids will continue to be overweight into adulthood.2 As mentioned earlier, we may be in the process of raising the first generation of children in America with a shorter predicted life span than their parents.3

The food industries like to blame inactivity as the prime cause of obesity, not the promotion and consumption of their calorie-rich products.4 On the contrary, however, research suggests that the level of physical activity may have actually increased in the United States over the past few decades.5 We know that obesity is rising even in areas where people are exercising more.6 This is likely explained by the fact that eating activity levels are outstripping physical activity levels.7

Compared to eating habits in the 1970s, every day, children are consuming the caloric equivalent of an extra can of soda and small fries, and adults are eating an extra Big Mac’s worth of calories. Just to make up for the extra calories Americans are taking in compared to a few decades ago, as a nation, we’d need to walk an extra two hours a day, every day of the week.8

Surveys suggest that most people believe controlling diet and getting enough exercise are equally important for weight control.9 It’s a lot easier to eat, however, than to move. To walk off the calories found in a single pat of butter or margarine, you’d have to add about an extra half mile to your evening stroll. For every additional sardine on your Caesar salad, that’s another quarter-mile jog. If you eat two chicken legs, you’ll need to get up on your own two legs and run three miles just to make up for it—and that’s stewed chicken, skin removed.10

Researchers who accept grants from the Coca-Cola Company11 call physical inactivity “the biggest public health problem of the 21st century.”12 Actually, physical inactivity ranks down at number five in terms of risk factors for death in the United States and number six in terms of risk factors for disability.13 And inactivity barely makes the top ten globally.14 As we’ve learned, diet is by far our greatest killer, followed by smoking.15

Of course, that doesn’t mean you should sit on the couch all day. As we’ve seen in this book, in addition to helping you enjoy a healthy body weight, exercise can also ward off and possibly reverse mild cognitive decline, boost your immune system, prevent and treat high blood pressure, and improve your mood and quality of sleep, among many other benefits. If the U.S. population collectively exercised enough to shave just 1 percent off the national body mass index (BMI), 2 million cases of diabetes, 1.5 million cases of heart disease, and up to 127,000 cases of cancer might be prevented.

Stand Up for Your Health

It turns out your mom and dad were right about the hazards of watching too much television—although it may not rot the brain so much as the body. Based on a study of about nine thousand adults followed for seven years, researchers calculated that every additional hour spent watching TV per day may be associated with an 11 percent increased risk of death.17 Screen time in general—including playing video games—appears to be a risk factor for premature death.18 So does that mean you have to kill your TV and PlayStation before they kill you?

It’s not the electronics themselves but the sedentary behavior associated with enjoying them. Of course, not all sedentary behaviors are bad.19 Consider sleeping—you can’t be more sedentary than that! The problem appears to be sedentary sitting. After tracking the health of more than one hundred thousand Americans for fourteen years, an American Cancer Society study found that men who sit for six hours or more per day have a 20 percent higher overall death rate compared to men who sit for three hours or less, while women who sit for more than six hours have a 40 percent higher death rate.20 A meta-analysis of forty-three such studies found that excess sitting was associated with a shorter life span,21 and this may be “regardless of physical activity level.” In other words, people who religiously hit the gym after work may still have shortened life spans if they are otherwise sitting throughout the day. Sitting for six or more hours a day appears to increase mortality rates even among people who run or swim for an hour a day, every day, seven days a week.22

I’m not saying we should all quit our desk jobs, but there are other options. For instance, try switching to a standing desk, which elevates the heart rate and may burn as many as fifty extra calories per hour. This may not seem like a lot, but simply standing for three hours a day at work equates to about thirty thousand extra calories burned per year—the equivalent of running ten marathons.23 Whether you’re at the office, reading the newspaper at home, or, yes, even watching TV, why not find a way to stand while doing it? In fact, most of this book was written while I was walking fifteen miles a day on a treadmill underneath my standing desk. Prebuilt treadmill desks are expensive, but thrift stores are often awash with old exercise equipment. My treadmill “desk” is just a treadmill stuck under some cheap plastic shelving.

*****************************************************************************
If you have been sedentary for a long time, start out slowly. I’m sure you’ve heard the familiar refrain: “Before starting this or any other exercise program, be sure to check with your doctor.” This is definitely true for vigorous exercise, but most people can safely start to take up walking ten or fifteen minutes a few times a day. If, however, you are unsteady on your feet, prone to dizzy spells, or have a chronic or unstable health condition, it really is best to first consult with a health professional.

**********************************************
What If You Really Have to Sit All Day?

Why is sitting around so bad for you? One reason may be endothelial dysfunction, the inability of the inner lining of your blood vessels to signal your arteries to relax normally in response to blood flow. Just as your muscles atrophy if you don’t use them, “use it or lose it” may apply to arterial function as well. Increased blood flow promotes a healthy endothelium.24 Blood flow is what maintains the stability and integrity of the inner lining of your arteries. Without that constant tugging flow with each heartbeat of exertion, you can end up a sitting duck for arterial dysfunction diseases.

What if sitting all day is part of your job? Research suggests treadmill desks may improve the health of office workers without detracting from work performance,25 but your office might not accommodate a standing desk. Preliminary evidence from observational26 as well as interventional27 studies suggests that regular interruptions in sitting time can be beneficial. And they don’t have to be long. Breaks could be as short as one minute and not necessarily entail strenuous exercise—just walking up and down stairs may be enough. Another option at a sedentary workplace is to opt for “walking meetings” rather than traditional sit-downs.

************************ you still need to move around as much as possible—the combination of curcumin and exercise appears to work even better**********************************

What if you have a sitting job in which you can’t take frequent breaks, like truck driving? Is there any way to improve your endothelial function sitting on your butt? First you need to get rid of any butts—cigarette butts, that is. Smoking a single cigarette can significantly impair endothelial function.28 Diet-wise, drinking green tea every two hours can help keep your endothelium functional,29 as can eating meals with greens and other nitrate-rich vegetables. (See chapter 7.)

Turmeric may also help. One head-to-head study found that daily ingestion of the turmeric component curcumin can improve endothelial function just as well as up to an hour a day of aerobic exercise.30 Does that mean you can just be a couch potato as long as you eat curried potatoes? No, you still need to move around as much as possible—the combination of curcumin and exercise appears to work even better than either option alone.31

Treating Sore Muscles with Plants

Optimizing recovery from exercise is considered the holy grail of exercise science.32 Anyone who works out regularly knows about sore muscles. There’s the burning sensation during strenuous exercise, which may be related to the buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, and then there’s delayed-onset muscle soreness, the kind you get in the days following extreme physical activity. Delayed soreness is likely the result of inflammation caused by microtears in your muscles and can adversely affect athletic performance in the days following a heavy workout. If you’re suffering from an inflammatory reaction, might anti-inflammatory phytonutrients help? The bioflavonoids in citrus can help with the lactic acid buildup,33 but you may need to ramp up to the anthocyanin flavonoids in berries to deal with the inflammation.

Muscle biopsies of athletes have confirmed that eating blueberries, for example, can significantly reduce exercise-induced inflammation.34 Studies using cherries show that this anti-inflammatory effect can translate into faster recovery time, reducing the strength loss from excessive bicep curling from 22 percent down to only 4 percent in male college students over the subsequent four days.35 The muscle-soothing effects of berries don’t only work for weight lifters; follow-up studies have shown that cherries can also help reduce muscle pain in long-distance runners36 and aid in recovery from marathons.37

Eating two cups of watermelon prior to intense physical activity was also found to significantly reduce muscle soreness. The researchers concluded that functional compounds in fruits and vegetables can “play a key role in the design of new natural and functional products” like beverages, juices, and energy bars.38 But why design new products when nature has already designed everything you need?

Preventing Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress

As discussed in part 1, when you use oxygen to burn fuel in your body, free radicals can be produced, just as cars burning fuel produce combustion by-products out the exhaust. This happens even if you’re just idling, living your day-to-day life. What if you rev things up, start exercising, and really start burning fuel? Might you create more oxidative stress and therefore need to eat even more antioxidant-rich foods?

Studies have demonstrated that ultramarathoners show evidence of DNA damage in about 10 percent of their cells tested during39 and up to two weeks following40 a race. But most of us aren’t ultramarathoners. Might short bouts of exercise still damage your DNA?

Yes. After just five minutes of moderate or intense cycling, you can get an uptick in DNA damage.41 Never ones to miss an opportunity, pharmaceutical and supplement companies have investigated ways to block exercise-induced oxidative damage with antioxidant pills, but, ironically, this may lead to a state of pro-oxidation. For example, guys doing arm curls taking about 1,000 mg of vitamin C ended up with more muscle damage and oxidative stress.42

Instead of using supplements, what about using antioxidant-rich foods to douse the free radicals? Researchers led subjects onto treadmills and cranked up the intensity until they nearly collapsed. While a spike in free-radical levels was witnessed in the control group, subjects who loaded up on watercress two hours before exercising actually ended up with fewer free radicals after the treadmill test than when they started. After two months of eating a daily serving of watercress, no DNA damage resulted, no matter how much it seemed the subjects were punished on the treadmill.43 So, with a healthy diet, you can get the best of both worlds—all the benefits of strenuous exercise without excess free-radical damage. As a review in the Journal of Sports Sciences put it, those who eat plant-based diets may naturally “have an enhanced antioxidant defence system to counter exercise-induced oxidative stress.”44 Whether it’s about training longer or living longer, the science seems clear. Your quality and quantity of life improves when you choose green-light foods.

How Much Should You Exercise?

The current official physical activity guidelines recommend adults get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic exercise, which comes out to a little more than 20 minutes a day.45 That’s actually down from previous recommendations from the surgeon general,46 the CDC, and the American College of Sports Medicine,47 which recommended at least 30 minutes each day. The exercise authorities seem to have fallen into the same trap as the nutrition authorities, recommending what they think may be achievable, rather than simply informing you what the science says and letting you make up your own mind. They already emphasize that any physical activity is better than none,48 so why not stop patronizing the public and just tell everyone the truth?

It is true that walking 150 minutes a week is better than walking 60 minutes a week. Following the current recommendations for 150 minutes appears to reduce your overall mortality rate by 7 percent compared to being sedentary. Walking for only 60 minutes a week only drops your mortality rate about 3 percent. But walking 300 minutes a week drops overall mortality by 14 percent.49 So walking twice as long—40 minutes a day compared to the recommended 20—yields twice the benefit. And an hour-long walk each day may reduce mortality by 24 percent!50 (I use walking as an example because it’s an exercise nearly everyone can do, but the same goes for other moderate-intensity activities, such as gardening or cycling.51)

A meta-analysis of physical activity dose and longevity found that the equivalent of about an hour a day of brisk (4 mph) walking was good, but 90 minutes was even better.52 What about more than 90 minutes? Unfortunately, so few people exercise that much every day that there weren’t enough studies to compile a higher category. If we know 90 minutes of exercise a day is better than 60 minutes is better than 30 minutes, why is the recommendation only 20 minutes? I understand that only about half of Americans even make the recommended 20 minutes a day,53 so the authorities are just hoping to nudge people in the right direction. It’s like the dietary guidelines advising us to “eat less candy.” If only they’d just give it to us straight.

That’s what I’ve tried to do in this book.



// How to eat more plant food *****************************

Even More Vegetables!

My favorite way to eat raw veggies is to dip bell pepper strips, carrots, or snap peas in a hummus or bean dip, and my favorite way to eat them cooked is by roasting them. Roasting can transform vegetables into otherworldly creations. If you don’t believe me, try roasting red bell peppers, brussels sprouts, beets, or squash. Never thought you liked okra because it’s too slimy? Try it roasted.

One of my favorite springtime dishes is roasted asparagus dipped in guacamole. (Here’s an interesting asparagus fact: Did you know there are four types of people in the world? Those whose pee turns stinky after eating asparagus, and those whose doesn’t, and those who are apparently genetically incapable of smelling the asparagus pee odor, and, finally, those who can. So some people may not think they get stinky pee from asparagus, but they actually do and just can’t smell it!32)

Sweet potatoes are one of my favorite snacks. During harsh Boston winters while I was in medical school, I would take two freshly microwaved sweet potatoes and pop them in my coat pockets as natural hand warmers. When they cooled down, my hand warmers became instant healthy snacks! It’s actually better to boil them, though, to best preserve their nutritional content.33 Regardless of your cooking method, be sure to keep on the skin. The peel of the sweet potato has nearly ten times the antioxidant power as the inner flesh (on a per-weight basis), giving them an antioxidant capacity approaching that of blueberries.34

Sweet potatoes themselves can be considered a superfood.35 They are ranked as one of the healthiest foods on the planet36 and one day, perhaps, even off the planet—NASA has chosen them for future space missions.37 In fact, they’re among the healthiest and cheapest, with one of the highest nutrient-rich food scores per dollar.38 When picking out varieties at the supermarket, remember that a sweet potato’s nutritional content is tied directly to the intensity of its color. The more yellow or orange its flesh, the healthier it may be.39

Sweet potatoes are healthier than plain potatoes, but if you’re going to choose the latter, seek out those with blue or purple flesh. The consumption of one boiled purple potato a day for six weeks was found to significantly decrease inflammation, something neither white nor yellow potatoes were able to accomplish.40 The same was found for oxidation, but much faster. Within hours of consumption, purple potatoes increased the antioxidant capacity of study subjects’ bloodstream, whereas white potato starch appeared to actually have a pro-oxidant effect.41 Blue potatoes may have ten times more antioxidant power than regular white ones.42 The most exciting purple potato study to date had people with hypertension eat six to eight microwaved small purple potatoes a day, and they were able to significantly bring down their blood pressure levels within a month.43

Purple sweet potatoes may offer the best of both worlds.44 I was so excited to discover them that I bought them as holiday gifts for my family one year—stocking stuffers they could stuff themselves with!

Getting Kids (and Parents) to Eat Their Veggies

Published strategies for getting kids (of all ages) to eat their vegetables include cutting them into slices, sticks, or stars—the most popular shape.45 Supposedly, putting an Elmo sticker on veggies swayed 50 percent of children to choose broccoli over a chocolate bar.46 If they’re still not biting, though, you can apply the same trick I use to get our dog to take her pills: Dip the veggies in peanut butter. A study found that pairing vegetables with peanut butter successfully increases intake “even in vegetable-resistant children.”47 Offering a salad dressing dip has also been found to help.48

Simply having healthy foods out and available can boost intake. Guess what happened when researchers put out bowls of cut-up fresh fruit in addition to the regular party fare brought by parents for kindergarten or preschool celebrations? No special effort was made to encourage students to choose the fruit—the researchers just put it out on the table with all the other food. Would kids actually eat fruit when such foods as birthday cake, ice cream, and cheese puffs were available? Yes! On average, each kid ate a full fruit serving.49 Take that, cheese puffs!

Even just calling vegetables by different names can help. Elementary schools were able to double vegetable consumption simply by coming up with names that better appealed to the kids. Students ate twice the number of carrots if they were called “X-Ray Vision Carrots,” compared to when they were just carrots or generically called the “Food of the Day.”50 Are adults as gullible? Apparently so. For example, grown-ups reported “Traditional Cajun Red Beans and Rice” tasted better than just “Red Beans with Rice” … even though they were the exact same dish.51

When school cafeterias put out signs like Power Punch Broccoli and Silly Dilly Green Beans, or called broccoli Tiny Tasty Tree Tops, selection of broccoli increased by about 110 percent, and selection of green beans jumped by nearly 180 percent.52 The researchers concluded that “these studies demonstrate that using an attractive name to describe a healthy food in a cafeteria is robustly effective, persistent, and scalable with little or no money or experience. These names were not carefully crafted, discussed in focus groups, and then pretested.” They were just invented out of thin air. And kids were suckered into eating healthier for weeks simply by adults’ putting out silly little signs. Indeed, in the school displaying these playful new names in the cafeteria line, vegetable purchasing went up nearly 100 percent, while in the control school without signs, vegetable purchases started low and actually got worse.53 So why isn’t every single school in the country doing this right now? Bring it up at your next PTA meeting.

Let’s not forget the hide-the-veggies strategy. Studies have shown that broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini can be added covertly to familiar entrées such that the appearance, flavor, and texture of the original recipes are maintained (like puréeing vegetables into a pasta sauce).54 Studies found the trick works for adults too. Researchers were able to slip in up to a pound of clandestine vegetables a day (resulting in 350 fewer calories eaten).55 Surreptitiously incorporating vegetables into foods shouldn’t be the only way that vegetables are served to children, though. Since the appetite for an initially unappetizing vegetable can be increased through repeated exposure, it is important to use several strategies to ensure that kids experience whole vegetables. After all, they’re not always going to be eating at home. One of the most important predictors of children’s fruit and vegetable consumption has been found to be parents’ consumption,56 so if you want your kids to eat healthfully, it helps to be a healthy role model.

//*************************** Headaches, Pain in general, motion sickness *******************************
Ginger(Take it after a meal)

Many successful natural treatments start like this: Some doctor learns that a plant has been used in some ancient medical tradition and figures, “Why not try it in my practice?” Ginger has been used for centuries for headaches, and so a group of Danish physicians advised one of their migraine patients to give it a go. At the first sign of a migraine coming on, the patient mixed a quarter teaspoon of powdered ginger in some water and drank it. Within thirty minutes, the migraine disappeared. And it worked every time for her, with no apparent side effects.55

This is what’s called a case report. Though they’re really just glorified anecdotes, case reports have played an important role in the history of medicine, from the discovery of AIDS56 to a failed chest-pain drug with a billion-dollar side effect—Viagra.57 Case reports are considered the weakest form of evidence, but that’s often where investigations begin.58 So the case report of successfully treating one migraine patient with ginger isn’t so much helpful in itself, but it can inspire researchers to put it to the test.

Eventually, a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was performed comparing the efficacy of ginger for the treatment of migraine headaches to sumatriptan (Imitrex), one of the top-selling, billion-dollar drugs in the world. Just one-eighth of a teaspoon of powdered ginger worked just as well and just as fast as the drug (and costs less than a penny). Most migraine sufferers started with moderate or severe pain, but after taking the drug or the ginger, ended up in mild pain or were entirely pain-free. The same proportion of migraine sufferers reported satisfaction with the results either way.

As far as I’m concerned, ginger won. Not only is ginger a few billion dollars cheaper, but it caused significantly fewer side effects. While on the drug, people reported dizziness, a sedative effect, vertigo, and heartburn, but the only side effect reported for ginger was an upset stomach in about one out of twenty-five people.59 (A whole tablespoon of ginger powder at one time on an empty stomach could irritate anyone, though,60 so don’t overdo it.) Sticking to one-eighth of a teaspoon is not only up to three thousand times cheaper than taking the drug, you’re probably less likely to end up as a case report yourself, like the people who have had a heart attack after taking sumatriptan for a migraine,61 or have died.62

Migraines are described as “one of the most common” pain syndromes, affecting as much as 12 percent of the population.63 That’s common? How about menstrual cramps, which plague up to 90 percent of younger women?64 Can ginger help? Even just one-eighth of a teaspoon of ginger powder three times a day dropped pain from an eight to a six on a scale of one to ten, and down further to a three in the second month.65 And these women hadn’t been taking ginger all month; they started the day before their periods began, suggesting that even if it doesn’t seem to help much the first month, women should try sticking with it.

What about the duration of pain? A quarter teaspoon of ginger powder three times a day was found to not only drop the severity of menstrual pain from about seven down to five but decrease the duration from a total of nineteen hours in pain down to about fifteen hours,66 significantly better than the placebo, which were capsules filled with powdered toast. But women don’t take bread crumbs for their cramps. How does ginger compare to ibuprofen? Researchers pitted one-eighth of a teaspoon of powdered ginger head-to-head against 400 mg of ibuprofen, and the ginger worked just as effectively as this leading drug.67 Unlike the drug, ginger can also reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding, from around a half cup per period down to a quarter cup.68 What’s more, ginger intake of one-eighth of a teaspoon twice daily started a week before your period can yield a significant drop in premenstrual mood, physical, and behavioral symptoms.69

I like sprinkling powdered ginger on sweet potatoes or using it fresh to make lemon-ginger apple chews as an antinausea remedy. (Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve suffered from motion sickness.) There is an array of powerful antinausea drugs, but they come with a nausea-inducing list of side effects, so I’ve always striven to find natural remedies whenever possible for myself and for my patients.

Ginger has been used for thousands of years in traditional healing systems. In India, it’s known as maha-aushadhi, meaning “the great medicine.” However, it wasn’t proven to reduce nausea until 1982, when it beat out Dramamine in a head-to-head test in blindfolded volunteers who were spun around in a tilted, rotating chair.70 Ginger is now considered a nontoxic, broad-spectrum antiemetic (antivomiting agent) effective in countering nausea during motion sickness, pregnancy, chemotherapy, and radiation, and after surgery.71

Try making my lemon-ginger apple chews: In a blender, liquefy one peeled lemon with a palm-sized “hand” of fresh gingerroot. Use the mixture to coat thin slices of four apples, and then place them in a dehydrator until they reach desired chewiness. I like them a little moist, but you can dehydrate them further to make lemon-ginger apple chips, which store longer than the chews. For me, a few pieces eaten about twenty minutes before travel works wonders.

Note: Ginger is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but the maximum recommended daily dose of fresh ginger while pregnant is 20 grams (about four teaspoons of freshly grated gingerroot).72 Any more may have uterus-stimulating effects. Women using my apple chews recipe to combat morning sickness should spread out the four apples’ worth of chews or chips over several days.

//*******************************
The Top Cancer-Fighting Vegetables

According to a landmark American Institute for Cancer Research report, any effect of plant-based diets is “likely to be due not only to the exclusion of meat, but also to the inclusion of a larger number and of wider range of plant foods, containing an extensive variety of potential cancer-preventive substances.

In other words, it may not be enough to cut down on meat; you need to eat as many whole, healthy plant foods as possible. Meatless Mondays are great, but even more so when followed by Tomato Tuesdays, Watercress Wednesdays, and so on.

Different vegetables may target different cancers—sometimes even in the same organ. For example, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts are associated with lower risk of colon cancer in the middle and right side of your body, whereas risk of colon cancer farther down on the left side appears to be lowered more by carrots, pumpkins, and apples.58

An extraordinary study published in the journal Food Chemistry pitted thirty-four common vegetables in vitro against eight different types of human cancer cells: breast cancer, brain tumors, kidney cancer, lung cancer, childhood brain tumors, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer. Take breast cancer, for example. Seven vegetables (eggplant, bok choy, carrot, tomato, endive, fennel bulb, and romaine lettuce) appeared useless, suppressing breast cancer cell growth no more than the control. Six vegetables (orange bell pepper, english cucumber, radicchio, jalapeño, potato, and beetroot) nearly halved cancer growth, but five veggies (cauliflower, brussels sprouts, green onion, leek, and garlic) “abolished” cancer growth completely, stopping breast tumor cells dead in their tracks.59

There were two take-home messages to come out of this remarkable study. The first is that you should eat a portfolio of vegetables. Radishes, for example, are completely unable to stop pancreatic cancer cell growth. However, radishes were 100 percent effective at halting the growth of stomach cancer cells. Orange bell peppers were useless against stomach cancer, but they were able to suppress prostate cancer cell growth by more than 75 percent. In the words of the researchers, “a diversified diet, containing several distinct classes of vegetables (and hence of phytochemicals) is essential for effective prevention of cancer.”60



// No juicing
If you like drinking your fruit, blending is better than juicing to preserve nutrition. Juicing removes more than just fiber. Most of the polyphenol phytonutrients (see chapter 3) in fruits and vegetables appear to be bound to the fiber and are only liberated for absorption by the friendly flora in your gut. When you merely drink the juice, you lose out on the fiber and all the nutrition that was attached to it.4 Even just cloudy apple juice, which retains a bit of the fruit fiber, appears to have nearly triple the phenolics compared to clear apple juice.5

Whereas greater consumption of whole fruits has been associated with a lower likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, Harvard University researchers found that greater juice consumption was associated with higher diabetes risk. So, by choosing yellow-light sources of fruit, like juice or jelly, you may not only be missing out on nutrients but actively working against your health.6

// hydrogen sulfide
If you buy dried fruit, I recommend choosing unsulfured varieties. Sulfur-containing preservatives, such as sulfur dioxide in dried fruit and sulfites in wine, can form hydrogen sulfide in your gut—this is the rotten egg gas implicated in the development of the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis. The main source of hydrogen sulfide is the metabolism of animal protein,18 but you can further lower your exposure by avoiding sulfur additives (either by reading labels or choosing organic, in which such preservatives are forbidden). The sulfur naturally contained in cruciferous vegetables does not appear to elevate colitis risk,19 so feel free to add kale chips to your healthy snacking menu.

*************************** antioxidants
In terms of antioxidant bang for your buck, açai berries get honorable mention, beating out other superstars, such as walnuts, apples, and cranberries. The bronze for best bargain, though, goes to cloves, the silver to cinnamon, and the gold for most antioxidants per dollar—according to a USDA database of common foods—goes to purple cabbage.24 Açai berries, however, would probably make a tastier smoothie.

// Fibers in your diet feed your gut bacteria. Some of the short chain fatty acids are then absorbed from your colon into the bloodstream, they reach the brain and signal to reduce appetite and increase metabolism.
That's why we feel satiated for a longer time when we add beans or whole grains in our meal.

//
Don't cut nuts from diet. Nuts and green leafy plants a bit every day add years to ones life. Nuts do contain fats, but you get about 20% less of total calories from nuts, because the fats are too well packaged and they just pass right through. Besides they are healthy fats. Nuts are not recommended when you try to lose weight, but a few a day are fine.

//
If the full spectrum of colorful plant pigments are good for you, why are greens the healthiest? When autumn in New England becomes aflame with brilliant hues, where do those oranges and yellows come from? They were there all along, actually—just masked by the green pigment chlorophyll that starts to break down in the fall.10 Similarly, the dark-green leaves of vegetables contain many of the other plant pigments all wrapped up in one package. As I mentioned, these colorful compounds are often the very same antioxidants implicated in many of the benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption. So, in essence, when you eat your greens, you are eating the rainbow.

// Mushrooms everyday
Mushrooming Benefits

Ergothioneine is an unusual amino acid. Although it was discovered more than a century ago, it was ignored until recently when researchers found that humans have a transporter protein in their bodies specifically designed to pull ergothioneine out of food and into body tissue. This suggests that this amino acid plays some important physiological role. But what? Our first clue was the tissue distribution. Ergothioneine concentrates in parts of your body where there is a lot of oxidative stress—your liver and the lenses of your eyes, for example, as well as such sensitive tissues as bone marrow and semen. Researchers guessed, then, that it might act as a so-called cytoprotectant, a cell protector, and that’s indeed what was subsequently found.25

Ergothioneine appears to function as a potent intramitochondrial antioxidant, meaning it can get inside the mitochondria—the microscopic power plants within your cells. The DNA inside the mitochondria is especially vulnerable to free-radical damage, since many other antioxidants are unable to penetrate the mitochondrial membrane. This is one reason ergothioneine may be so important. Depriving human cells of this amino acid leads to accelerated DNA damage and cell death. Unfortunately, the human body cannot make ergothioneine; you can only get it through food. “Because of its dietary origin and the toxicity associated with its depletion,” Johns Hopkins University researchers concluded, “ET [ergothioneine] may represent a new vitamin…”26 If it were classified as such, that would make it the first new vitamin since vitamin B12 was isolated back in 1948.27

What are the best dietary sources of ergothioneine? The highest levels by far have been reported in mushrooms. For example, oyster mushrooms, which you can grow yourself in only two weeks from a just-add-water kit, have more than one thousand units (μg/dag) of ergothioneine, about nine times more than their closest competitor, black beans. And a serving of black beans has about eight times more than a serving of the third-leading source, chicken liver. Chicken meat, along with beef and pork, only has about ten units, one hundred times less than oyster mushrooms. Kidney beans have about four times more than meat, but even at forty-five units, they pale in comparison to some of the mushrooms.28

Ergothioneine is heat stable, which means it’s not destroyed when mushrooms are cooked.29 This is good news, because it’s best not to eat mushrooms raw; there’s a toxin in edible mushrooms called agaritine to which you should minimize your exposure. Thankfully, the toxin is destroyed by cooking. Just thirty seconds in the microwave wipes out most agaritine in mushrooms. Freezing also gets rid of most of it, but drying does not. If you put dried mushrooms in your soup, it’s best to boil them for at least five minutes.30 Morel mushrooms are a special case. The toxin levels appear higher and may react with alcohol even after cooking.31 I consider all other cooked edible mushrooms to be green-light foods and all other edible raw mushrooms yellow-light foods. However, raw morel mushrooms, cooked morels served with alcohol, and all wild-foraged mushrooms should be on the red-light list in my opinion.

Do you have to eat mushrooms to be healthy? No. (Otherwise, it would be the Daily Baker’s Dozen.) Famously in our family, my mom has never eaten a mushroom in her life and never will, because they “look funny.” But given the potential immune and anticancer benefits documented in chapters 5 and 11, I would encourage you to try to find ways to incorporate them into your diet.

My favorite way to enjoy mushrooms is to grill portobellos. I picked up a George Foreman Grill from my local thrift store, and my family has officially renamed it the Portobello Mushroom Grill. I know people tend to marinate portobellos first, but I just drizzle them with balsamic vinegar, grill until the juice starts dripping, and then add cracked pepper. They’re so good we eat them just like that.

Pop quiz: Which is healthier? Plain white mushrooms or portobellos? Trick question! They’re the same mushroom. The little white button mushrooms grow up to be portobellos. White mushrooms are just baby ’bellos.

Mushrooms can be stuffed, enjoyed in soups like mushroom barley, act as the star of a creamy risotto or pâté, serve as the base of a great gravy or as a flavorful addition to any pasta sauce, or simply be braised with crushed garlic in red wine.

Eating Better to Look Better

We’ve all heard of the proverbial golden glow that’s often equated with health, vitality, and youth. But instead of using a tanning bed to achieve a more golden hue, you can do it with a bed of greens.

There are certain animals who use diet to increase their sexual attractiveness. Great tits, distinctive olive-and-black songbirds ubiquitous throughout Europe and Asia, tend to prefer carotenoid-rich caterpillars, which make their breast plumage brighter yellow, to become more attractive to potential mates.18 Can a similar phenomenon be found in humans?

Researchers took digital photographs of African, Asian, and Caucasian men and women and asked others to manipulate the skin tone of their faces with a dial until they reached what they perceived to be the healthiest-looking color.19 Sure enough, both men and women preferred the yellow “golden glow” that can be achieved through “dietary carotenoid deposition in the skin.”20 In other words, by eating the yellow and red pigments in fruits and vegetables, like beta-carotene in sweet potatoes and lycopene in tomatoes, men and women may be able to naturally acquire more of a golden and rosy glow. Researchers decided to put it to the test.

Based on a six-week study of college students, the complexion achieved by eating my Daily Dozen recommendation of nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day was found to be significantly healthier and more attractive looking than that achieved by eating three daily servings.21 The healthier you eat, the healthier you look. Indeed, studies find that “individuals with the lowest fruit and vegetable intake may enjoy the most improvement in appearance.”22

What about wrinkles? A study out of Japan used the six-point Daniell scale to rate the extent of crow’s-feet wrinkles around the eyes of more than seven hundred women, with a score of one being the least severe and a score of six being the most severe. The researchers found that “a higher intake of green and yellow vegetables was associated with decreased facial wrinkling.” Women who ate less than one daily serving of green and yellow veggies averaged about a three on the Daniell scale, while women who ate more than two servings a day averaged closer to a two. The researchers celebrated “the potential for these studies to promote a healthy diet…”23

I am certainly not above appealing to vanity, especially for my younger patients who have seemed more interested in which dietary changes will clear their acne than which will clear their future risk of chronic disease. So I’m happy to see articles embrace these types of studies with headlines like “Greens to Be Gorgeous.”24 Still, although looking great on the outside is fine, looking great on the inside is even better.

//******************************************************
Even More Vegetables!

My favorite way to eat raw veggies is to dip bell pepper strips, carrots, or snap peas in a hummus or bean dip, and my favorite way to eat them cooked is by roasting them. Roasting can transform vegetables into otherworldly creations. If you don’t believe me, try roasting red bell peppers, brussels sprouts, beets, or squash.

So some people may not think they get stinky pee from asparagus, but they actually do and just can’t smell it!32)

Sweet potatoes are one of my favorite snacks. During harsh Boston winters while I was in medical school, I would take two freshly microwaved sweet potatoes and pop them in my coat pockets as natural hand warmers. When they cooled down, my hand warmers became instant healthy snacks! It’s actually better to boil them, though, to best preserve their nutritional content.33 Regardless of your cooking method, be sure to keep on the skin.

Purple sweet potatoes may offer the best of both worlds.44 I was so excited to discover them that I bought them as holiday gifts for my family one year—stocking stuffers they could stuff themselves with!




// Eat more greens and add source of fat

The sweetness trick is why green smoothies can be so delicious (if not a little odd looking). Smoothies can be a great way to introduce greens into children’s diets. The basic triad is a liquid, ripe fruit, and fresh greens. I’d start with a two-to-one ratio of fruits to greens to start with before tipping heavier toward greens on the scale. So, for example, one cup of water, a frozen banana, a cup of frozen berries, and a cup of packed baby spinach would be a classic green smoothie 101.

I like to add fresh mint leaves as well for a boost of flavor (and even more greens). Fresh herbs can be expensive at the store, but mint can grow like a weed in your yard or in a pot on your windowsill. Eating greens for breakfast can be as delicious as mint chocolate oatmeal—cooked oatmeal, chopped mint leaves, cocoa powder, and a healthy sweetener (see here).

When you’re thinking about ways to pair your greens with something you already love to make the greens more palatable, consider mixing them with a green-light source of fat: nuts, seeds, nut or seed butters, or avocados. Many of the nutrients greens are famous for are fat soluble, including beta-carotene, lutein, vitamin K, and zeaxanthin. So pairing your greens with a green-light source of fat may not only make them taste better but will maximize nutrient absorption. This can mean enjoying a creamy tahini-based dressing on your salad, putting walnuts in your pesto, or sprinkling some toasted sesame seeds on your sautéed kale.

The jump in nutrient absorption is no small effect. When researchers tried feeding people a healthy salad of spinach, romaine, carrots, and tomatoes along with a source of fat, there was an impressive spike in carotenoid phytonutrients in their bloodstream over the next eight hours. With a fat-free dressing, carotenoid absorption flatlined down to negligible amounts; it was as if they’d never eaten the salad at all.23 Similarly, adding some avocado to your salsa may triple the amount of fat-soluble nutrients that make it into your bloodstream (in this case, the lycopene in the tomatoes).24 It doesn’t take much. Just three grams of fat in an entire hot meal may be sufficient to boost absorption.25 That’s just a single walnut or a spoonful of avocado or shredded coconut. Snack on a few pistachios after a meal, and you’re all set. The greens and the source of fat just have to end up in your stomach at the same time.

Another way to remove bitterness from greens is to blanch or boil them, but unfortunately this works by leaching some of the healthy compounds into the cooking water.26 If you’re making soup, that’s not a problem, because the nutrients aren’t destroyed as much as they are displaced. If the cooking liquid is poured off, however, you could be losing some nutrition. But even if 50 percent of these healthy compounds go down the drain, if the decreased bitterness motivates you to eat twice as many greens, problem solved! Whenever I’m boiling pasta, for example, I’ll add a bunch of fresh greens to the pot a few minutes before I’m ready to drain the pasta. I know I’ll be losing some nutrients when I pour off the cooking water, but it’s worth it to me for the convenience of throwing everything into one pot and getting my family to eat even more greens.

Try to incorporate greens into as many meals as possible. I put just about everything I eat on a bed of greens. That way, the greens take on the flavor of the rest of the dish. However, if you want to eat cooked greens “straight,” you can try adding lemon juice, flavored vinegars, red pepper flakes, garlic, ginger, low-sodium soy sauce, or caramelized onions. I personally like mine hot, sweet, smoky, and salty. I use hot sauce for heat, balsamic glaze for sweetness, and both smoked paprika and liquid smoke. For saltiness, I used to be fond of a soy sauce substitute called Bragg Liquid Aminos until I got more serious about cutting down my sodium intake. The best sodium-free salt substitute I’ve been able to find is something called Table Tasty. (What’s with these names?)

There are whole grocery aisles full of prepared sauces with which you can experiment. Most have added salt, oil, or sugar, so I try to reserve them for exceptionally healthy foods. Mixing yellow- and red-light foods together (like dipping your fries and McNuggets in barbecue sauce) may just add insult to injury, but I wouldn’t eat half as many baked rosemary sweet-potato fries if I weren’t dipping them in hot-sauce-spiked ketchup. And if there were ever an excuse to dip out of the green-light zone, it would be for green, leafy vegetables.

During my bachelor days, I would regularly order Chinese food for delivery—usually broccoli and garlic sauce (hold the white rice). Then I’d throw brown rice or quinoa along with dried lentils into my rice cooker and steam or microwave a pound of greens.

TLC
Despite the treatment’s beneficial effects, it’s still advisable to get a physical exam before you start putting the protocol into practice. In my own clinical research at the University of Kansas, I don’t let anyone begin the full program until they’ve first seen a doctor. This policy may surprise you, but it’s based on sound reasoning. For one thing, it’s always a good idea to check with a physician before embarking on a new exercise program. The same goes for taking high-dose nutritional supplements or increasing sun exposure. Since these are all core elements of the TLC program, it’s important to get your doctor’s okay before you begin.

// What is required to be healthy is simple, actually doing it is harder. Especially when merchants tempt the population and then they say the people have the freedom to choose. So there is easy access to unhealthy but tasty food, but the healthy stuff you have to cook it and sometimes is more expensive. Even if the healthy food was to be as easily accessible as unhealthy food, people will still opt for the unhealthy food because it's tastier. So if you are a child and get to choose you will always choose tasty vs healthy and if you grow that way thats how you most likely will continue with your life.

A group of Canadian medical researchers recently tried to find out just how much more. They recruited volunteers from their own hospital, and measured everyone’s blood levels of vitamin D during the dead of winter. Most people, of course, were deficient. So the human guinea pigs were randomly assigned to start taking either 1000 IU or 4000 IU of vitamin D3 each day. Surprisingly, even after a few months, many people taking 1000 IU a day—two and a half times the recommended amount—still didn’t get their blood levels up high enough. It took 4000 IU a day—for a period of up to three months—to bring everyone up into the ideal range.

Doctors can get skittish, though, when you starting talking 
about such a large daily dose of vitamin D. The biggest worry is that it might throw off your calcium balance, since vitamin D helps regulate the body’s ability to use this key mineral. However, no one in the Canadian study had any calcium-related problems (or any other adverse health effects) at the 4000 IU dose. Even more reassuring, a study last year looked at a group of multiple sclerosis patients taking 40,000 IU of vitamin D3 every day (one hundred times the recommended daily allowance), and none of them had any adverse medical effects, either.

Still, the official medical tolerable upper intake level for vitamin D, published by the Institute of Medicine in 1997, is listed at only 2000 IU per day. Anything above this level is considered potentially unsafe. Although numerous researchers in the area say this recommendation is outdated—that the tolerable limit should be raised—doctors are understandably reluctant to practice outside the field’s official guidelines.
 
So what should you do if you want to go the supplement route to make sure you have enough vitamin D? I’m afraid there’s no perfect solution, but you at least have some decent options.
 
The simplest approach is to start by taking 2000 IU of vitamin D3 in supplement form each day. (You can pick up a couple months’ supply at a local health food store for a few dollars.) This dose is high enough to push most people up into the ideal range for vitamin D blood levels. However, because the dose is 
also right at the tolerable upper intake level, it’s important to check with your doctor before starting on such a high-dose regimen. In addition, after a few months of supplementing at this dose, it would be a good idea to have your doctor do a blood test to make sure you’re actually getting enough. According to the best published evidence, your blood level of vitamin D36 should be at least as high as 30 ng/mL (or 75 nmol/L) for optimal health.
 
A more aggressive approach—but one you should definitely consider if you’re currently depressed, or if you have a history of seasonal affective disorder—is to see your doctor right away to have your blood level of vitamin D evaluated. If it’s very low (below 15 ng/mL or 37 nmol/L), you can talk with your doctor about taking a high dose of vitamin D3—up to 10,000 IU per day—for several weeks under his or her supervision, with regular monitoring to make sure there are no side effects, and to ensure that your blood levels make it quickly into a healthier range.

Vitamin B12 is more problematic. Vitamin B12 is made by microorganisms

adequately absorbed, so it is recommended that we consume B12 in food.
Research has convincingly shown that plants grown in healthy soil that
has a good concentration of vitamin B12 will readily absorb this nutrient.
However, plants grown in "lifeless" soil (non-organic soil) may
be deficient in vitamin B12. In the United States, most of our agriculture
takes place on relatively lifeless soil, decimated from years of unnatural
pesticide, herbicide and fertilizer use. So the plants grown in this soil
and sold in our supermarkets lack B12

who spend most of their time indoors and or live in the northern climates
are encouraged. For vitamin D, you shouldn't exceed RDA recommendations.

Psychotherapy in the Real World

 
During their medical school training, aspiring doctors are taught to base every treatment decision on an up-to-date knowledge of the relevant research literature, and they generally carry this scientific sensibility with them throughout their careers. So when physicians encounter, say, a patient with a clogged coronary artery, they should automatically begin generating a set of scientifically informed questions: What are the available treatment options? Which option—bypass surgery, angioplasty, medication, and so on—is likely to prove the most effective for this patient, given the location and extent of the blockage? What does the research say?
 
We take it as a given that a doctor’s decisions will be guided by the best available scientific evidence, and most of us would be appalled to find a physician who simply ignored or neglected the latest research findings in the field. Surely the same holds true for psychotherapists, doesn’t it? After all, just like medical doctors, therapists deal with an array of life-threatening conditions—disorders such as anorexia nervosa and substance abuse and depression. Aren’t psychotherapists, like physicians, trained to base their treatment decisions on the best and most relevant research evidence? Sadly, the majority are not.
 
The problem traces back to the enduring influence of Sigmund Freud, who launched the institution of psychotherapy over a century ago. Despite his superb scientific training as a research neurologist, Freud never felt the need to conduct careful scientific studies on the effectiveness of the psychotherapy techniques he developed. Indeed, Freud was so convinced that his treatment method just had to be effective, he asked the world to rely on the “evidence” of mere anecdotes and a smattering of published case studies—some of which were later shown by historians to have been fabricated. Likewise, his followers were encouraged to accept the effectiveness of Freudian therapy as an article of faith, rather than subjecting the therapy to rigorous scientific scrutiny. And for over a century Freud’s legacy has persisted: Many practicing psychotherapists still fail to base their clinical practice on sound scientific research.

After decades of tinkering and creative innovation, there are now over four hundred distinct varieties of psychotherapy being practiced by clinicians (with dozens of allegedly new techniques appearing each year), and the vast majority of these treatments have never been tested scientifically. Even when it comes to the treatment of depressive illness, many practicing therapists are still using techniques for which there is absolutely no supportive scientific evidence. This is not to say that all of these untested techniques are ineffective. They might work. But then again they might not. The point is that we simply have no way of knowing, and in the absence of solid research evidence we will never know for sure. Freudian therapy was practiced for nearly eighty years before a definitive set of studies showed that it’s often ineffective in treating depression.
 
How many other psychotherapy techniques in widespread use today will prove similarly unhelpful once they’re finally subjected to the clear light of scientific scrutiny? Although we have no way of knowing for certain, I believe it is now difficult for any therapist to justify using unproven techniques for treating depression when we have good research evidence that approaches like cognitive therapy and behavioral activation—when skillfully implemented—are reasonably effective, with a long-term efficacy at least equivalent to that of antidepressant medication.

Abstract
Obesity has traditionally been thought of as a state of caloric imbalance, where the intake of calories exceeds the expenditure or ‘burning’ of calories. However, a more nuanced appreciation for the complex biochemistry and physiology of cellular energy generation suggests that obesity is a state of hormonal imbalance causing increased shunting of food energy into adipose tissue for storage, resulting in decreased satiety and ultimately leading to increased caloric intake. Adding to this hypothesis, we propose that obesity is also a state of nutrient and energy deficit, leading to decreased fatty acid mobilisation and oxidation, the result of which may be a natural disinclination towards physical activity. Added sugars (sucrose, a.k.a. table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup) may provide energy (4 kcal/g) but at current intakes they do not facilitate—and may even hinder—the production of energy. Not only do added sugars displace nutritionally superior foods in the diet, but they may also deplete nutrients from other foods that have been consumed, as well as from body stores, in order to enable their proper oxidation and liberate their calories as energy. Additionally, the consumption of added sugars damages the mitochondria and hence impairs energy generation. Moreover, overconsuming added sugars may result in a kind of ‘internal starvation’ (via leptin and insulin resistance) leading to further hunger signals in the body. Added sugars promote nutrient and energy deficit and through this novel pathway promote obesity.

Introduction
Nutrient/energy deficit in obesity
Sugar was first extracted from sugar cane and sugar beets hundreds of years ago, and later ‘purified’ into a white crystalline form. In modern times, sugar has been isolated and refined to a degree that allows it to be integrated into the food supply in quantities and concentrations that do not occur naturally and are unlikely to have been encountered in human evolutionary history. Pure crystalline sugar, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and other caloric sweeteners consumed in beverages and processed foods provide a supra-physiological glycaemic load,1 overwhelming the body's processing capacity and leading to detrimental metabolic effects (eg, hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and oxidative stress).1 Because of this refinement, added sugars now behave like drug-like substances.2 3 Although edible, added sugars cannot be considered a ‘food’, nor can their consumption be equated to eating foods that contain natural amounts of sugar, but which also provide fibre, vitamins, minerals and other phytonutrients that combat oxidative stress produced by the small amounts of fructose present. As the ‘dose makes the poison’, the food industry has made it possible for consumers to easily ‘overdose’ on added sugars, making this an issue of concern for public health worldwide, wherever there is significant consumption of processed, highly refined and sugar-dense foods.

Added sugars are not food
Sugar is not among the recommended foods. Its recent rationing will not provoke a hardship, for sugar supplies nothing in nutrition but calories, and the vitamins provided by other foods are sapped by sugar to liberate these calories.4 (Emphasis added) (Wilder—Handbook of Nutrition)

The definition of food is, ‘Material that contains essential nutrients, which are assimilated by an organism to produce energy, stimulate growth and maintain life’.5 Many types of added sugars do not fit this definition. While caloric sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup, molasses and sorghum syrup (also known as ‘free sugars’) may provide trace amounts of micronutrients, the sweetening agents most commonly added to processed foods—sucrose and HFCS—do not. In fact, these added sugars not only lack essential nutrients, but they also have detrimental effects on all three important functions of food (eg, produce energy, stimulate growth and maintain life). These two added sugars (sucrose and HFCS) will be the disaccharides of focus in this review.

Added sugars do not produce energy or stimulate growth
Starting with the first necessary function of a food—‘produce energy’—added sugars in fact deplete energy from the body, either by depleting tissue nutrient stores or nutrients obtained from other ingested foods.4 Added sugars also displace nutritionally superior foods from the diet and at the same time increase nutritional requirements.4 6 Specifically, vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin and niacin are necessary for the oxidation of glucose, and phosphates are stripped from ATP in order to metabolise fructose, which leads to cellular ATP depletion.4 7 The metabolism of fructose also leads to oxidative stress, inflammation and damage to the mitochondria, causing a state of ATP depletion.8 Hence, the liberation of calories from added sugars requires nutrients and increases nutritional demands, but these sugars provide no additional nutrients. Thus, the more added sugars one consumes, the more nutritionally depleted one may become. This may be particularly extreme in individuals whose habitual diet is already insufficient in key micronutrients.

//* 
The conversion of food calories into energy in the form of ATP does not occur by chance, with no requirements for input into the biochemical pathways involved. Via glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, carbohydrates—including refined sugars—are converted into energy. The reactions these processes comprise are dependent on required cofactors in the form of vitamins and minerals; however, isolated and refined sugars have been stripped of their micronutrient content, which may impair their conversion into energy and/or result in a net nutrient deficit if such nutrients must be siphoned from body stores in order to keep these processes running efficiently. Contrast this with foods consumed in their whole, unrefined forms, which typically contain at least some of the nutrients required to liberate their energy.

The popularity of low-carbohydrate diets for fat loss, as well as their efficacy for improving a broad range of health conditions,9–12 has led to an unfortunate across-the-board demonisation of carbohydrates among some nutrition and healthcare professionals. While individuals who are insulin resistant or have type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes or the metabolic syndrome (which, according to the American Diabetes Association, is well over 100 million people in the USA alone, including as many as 26% of individuals aged 65 or older13) may manage their blood glucose and insulin levels best on reduced carbohydrate diets,10 11 14 it is not carbohydrate-dense foods, per se, that contribute to impaired energy production. Rather, it is carbohydrate foods that have been stripped of their natural complement of nutrients and fibre and extracted from their whole-food matrices that may be placing the largest metabolic burden on the body, particularly when they contain additional carbohydrates in the form of added sugars, such as may be found in soft drinks and cookies, crackers, bread, breakfast cereal, granola bars, etc, made from refined grains with additional sugars and sweeteners added as preservatives and for enhanced palatability.

Glycolysis—the conversion of glucose to pyruvate with a net yield of 2 ATP—requires magnesium as an enzyme cofactor in at least six individual reactions. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A and is the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, requires thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid for proper enzymatic function. B-vitamins are required again for effective functioning of the citric acid cycle, which will produce an additional 36 ATP, and is the process by which the majority of energy is generated in all cells except those lacking mitochondria. Unlike isolated refined sugars, carbohydrate-rich whole foods—such as sweet potatoes, white potatoes, beets, parsnips and winter squashes, as well as whole grains, such as hard red winter wheat and millet—provide critical minerals and B-vitamins required for the proper use of these foods in the body. Added sugars provide fuel in the form of carbohydrate but lack the accessory nutrients needed to convert that fuel into energy. We are not suggesting that each food consumed must, in isolation, contain the full complement of nutrients required for its metabolism and oxidation; a varied omnivorous diet would be expected to meet these basic nutritional needs. However, consumption of large amounts of added sugars may displace nutritionally superior foods in the diet, ultimately resulting in a net deficit of vitamin and mineral enzyme cofactors required for not only the oxidation of the glucose, itself, but for that of whole foods.

Additionally, fructose consumed at current levels found in much of the industrialised world has been found to deplete cellular ATP levels in vascular endothelial cells,15 with as little as 50 g of fructose (found in approximately one 24 oz soft drink) being able to deplete hepatic ATP levels in humans.16 17 This results in appetite stimulation and increased hunger signals, prompting increased caloric intake, which may ultimately lead to weight gain and obesity.8 As the average American consumes 83.1 g of fructose per day,18 with up to 20% of the population exceeding 100 g/day,15 current levels of fructose consumption may lead to chronic energy depletion causing increased hunger and lack of energy to exercise. Thus, increased caloric intake and reduced physical activity are logical consequences of overconsuming added sugars. However, while the end result may be obesity in susceptible individuals who are simply following the biological cues prompted by these hijacked metabolic processes, increased caloric intake and a reduction in physical activity (ie, eating more and moving less) are merely the proximal causes of body fat gain; consumption of large amounts of refined sugars is the ultimate underlying cause, triggering the cascade as a whole.19 As many soft drinks are produced with HFCS that contain up to 65% fructose, this is particularly concerning.20–22 The overconsumption of added sugars does not produce energy despite providing energy, which is somewhat of a paradox. In order for a substance to be classified as ‘food’, it must produce or at least facilitate the production of energy, not just provide energy.

The consumption of sugar and of other relatively pure carbohydrates has become so great during recent years that it presents a serious obstacle to the improved nutrition of the general public.4 (The Council on Foods and Nutrition, 1942)

Written over 70 years ago, this observation may be even more relevant today. Indeed, many of the concerns about the detrimental effects of sugar stem from its current excessive consumption worldwide. Recent estimates indicate that the average annual per capita consumption of sugar ranges from 77 to 152 pounds,23 24 which is ∼20-fold to 40-fold greater than estimates of consumption just a few hundred years ago.25 This level of consumption equates to around 400–800 calories per person per day from added sugars. On a diet of 2000 calories per day, 800 calories from added sugars represents a dilution of 40%, or a 40% displacement of foods with higher nutrient density by foods that not only provide fewer nutrients, but which may, in fact, require increased nutrient intake simply to be metabolised. It is easy to understand how consuming added sugars leads to nutritional deficit.4 6

Soft drink consumption is associated with lower intakes of calcium and other nutrients,26 which may lead to malnutrition, especially in children.2 Additionally, the overconsumption of added sugars is linked to the development of insulin resistance in humans and animals,27–30 which decreases the body's ability to use glucose as energy. Moreover, the ensuing rise in insulin levels decreases the body's ability to use its other key fuel source, fats. (Via inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase, chronically elevated insulin keeps fatty acids sequestered in adipose tissue, reducing their availability for β-oxidation and the generation of ATP.31 32) In essence, cells are starved for energy because energy generation from fatty acids is inhibited when insulin levels are high, resulting in what has been referred to as ‘internal starvation’ or ‘hidden cellular semistarvation’.33 More colloquially, it can be thought of as ‘starvation in the land of plenty’. Not only that, but elevated insulin levels increase energy requirements,31 further leading to a net energy loss with the consumption of added sugars. Owing to the lack of access to fuel substrates, individuals with obesity and hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance may fit the description of ‘overfed but undernourished’. While they are carrying thousands of calories of stored fuel in the form of adipose tissue, the hormonal pattern that they are locked into due to the overconsumption of refined sugars suggests that, at the cellular level, they are starving.

Sugar also has the ability to derail an appetite for nutrient-dense foods, causing further nutrient depletion.2 This is likely caused by the elevation in insulin levels prompted by refined carbohydrates, which may lead to cravings for yet more carbohydrate due to insulin's effect on fuel partitioning and its inhibition of energy generation from fatty acids.31 Animal studies also show that feeding sugar to rats hinders growth and shortens lifespan.18 34 Several other experiments in a variety of animal species show that the addition of sugar to otherwise adequate diets causes these animals to malnourish themselves to death.35 And numerous studies in animals indicate that replacing starch with sugar shortens their lifespan, so again, it is not carbohydrate, per se, that has a detrimental effect, but rather, refined and nutritionally void sugars.36–38 The aforementioned data do not support the definition of food.

Finally, fructose and glucose favour the growth of bacteria and yeast,2 39–41 particularly in those who already have elevated levels of yeast.42 Glucose has been found to increase the proliferation and virulence of Candida albicans.40 43 As C. albicans competes with host cells for nutrients44 and requires a high influx of glucose (yielding just two molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose metabolised via fermentation),45 this may be of particular concern with added sugars feeding increasing populations of intestinal yeast that then siphon nutrients and energy from the rest of the body. Sugar has also been shown to irritate the linings of the stomach and intestine,2 25 which may compromise digestive function and the absorption of nutrients. Finally, the hyperosmolar effect of fructose can induce diarrhoea,46 which may lead to a further loss of nutrients.2 Box 1 provides an overview of the mechanisms relating the consumption of added sugars with overall nutrient and energy depletion, making added sugars unfit to be considered food.

Box 1
How added sugars promote obesity through energy/nutrient depletion
Displaces nutritionally superior foods.2

Decreases appetite for more nutritious food.2

Depletes nutrients within the body (in order to liberate the calories from sugar, as well as from an increase in bacterial and yeast overgrowth).2

Provides zero nutrition.2

The consumption of added sugars has been shown to cause insulin resistance.27–30 This will result in decreased use of glucose for energy (decreased uptake into cells),47 as well as impaired oxidation of fatty acids for energy.31 32 Energy requirements are also increased due to elevated insulin levels.33 Thus, because the consumption of added sugars can lead to insulin resistance, they can induce a state of ‘internal starvation’, also referred to as ‘hidden cellular semistarvation’.33

Decreases nutrient absorption due to intestinal irritation/damage.2 25

Increases nutrient excretion caused by fructose malabsorption leading to diarrhoea.46

Damages the mitochondria and depletes ATP.8

Produces unnatural drug-like cravings leading to a vicious cycle of continued consumption and further nutrient depletion.

Added sugars do not maintain life
Mankind has survived without isolated, refined sugar for almost 2.6 million years.48 The body—in particular, the brain—has been thought to require upwards of 200 g of glucose per day, leading to the often cited dogma that glucose is ‘essential for life’.1 While it is true that glucose is essential for sustaining life, there is no requirement for dietary glucose, as fatty acids can be turned into brain-fuelling ketone bodies, and amino acids and glycerol are gluconeogenic substrates.49 Indeed, in the relative absence of dietary glucose, ketone bodies may supply upwards of 75% of the brain's required energy, with the remainder supplied by gluconeogenesis provided by amino acids (from dietary protein or catabolism of body proteins) and from glycerol (provided by the breakdown of triglycerides in adipose tissue).33 Thus, exogenous glucose (eg, from added sugars) is not essential for sustaining life in humans, and in most people, restricting dietary carbohydrates seems to produce no ill effects.49 In fact, according to the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academies of Sciences, ‘The lower limit of dietary carbohydrate compatible with life apparently is zero, provided that adequate amounts of protein and fat are consumed’.50

Administration of fructose or sucrose in humans has been shown to cause each of the abnormalities that define the metabolic syndrome (eg, elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, elevated blood glucose, elevated blood pressure and weight gain (specifically around the abdomen)),30 51–55 as well as features found in patients with coronary heart disease (eg, increased platelet adhesiveness and hyperinsulinaemia),56 57 all of which can be reversed entirely upon reverting to a diet low in sugar.47 52 56 58–60 Consumption of added sugars at current levels of intake is proposed as a contributing factor in a multitude of other diseases associated with early mortality, such as cardiometabolic disease,61–64 obesity,30 61 65–68 β-cell dysfunction and type 2 diabetes,6 20 69–71 hypertension,51 64 72 non-alcoholic fatty liver7 and atherosclerosis.6 73 74 Because of this, added sugars cannot be considered food.

Moving forward
As ∼75% of all packaged foods and beverages in the USA contain added sugars,75 efforts should focus on their reduction in order to combat numerous chronic disease states and improve the general nutritional status of the population as a whole. We are not here advocating for the total elimination of added sugars from the food supply. Such an approach is not only unnecessary, but is also economically unrealistic and culturally insensitive, as there are special events and celebrations that may call for traditional foods that contain large amounts of added sugars. Rather than complete removal of added sugars from one's diet, these metabolically taxing elements should be limited to occasional consumption and not be considered daily dietary staples.

There are myriad ways to accomplish a population-wide reduction in added sugars, including but not limited to: widespread public education campaigns; revision of food labels to call attention to added sugar; increased nutrition education in medical schools and for other primary healthcare providers; the taxing of edible goods high in added sugar;76–80 prohibition of government subsidies for foods high in added sugars;81 restricting the sale of beverages and edible goods high in added sugars (such as sports drinks, energy drinks and sodas) in schools and hospitals; and adding warning labels to sugar-sweetened beverages and other high-sugar products, similar to those applied to alcohol and tobacco.81 Such changes could contribute substantially to reducing population-wide intake of added sugars to a reasonable 5–10% of total caloric intake, which would likely lead to substantial improvement in public health.82

Go to:
Conclusion
We propose that obesity is a state of nutrient and energy deficit brought about, in part, by the overconsumption of added sugars (specifically high-fructose corn syrup and sucrose). Added sugars provide energy (calories), but in the context of consumption at current intake levels, they hinder the production of energy, and through the direct influence on a wide array of cardiometabolic disease processes, they lead to reduced quality of life and decreased lifespan, and thus cannot be considered food. As added sugars devoid of displace more nutrient-dense foods in the diet, dilute nutrients from the body's stores and promote a host of disease states that impair nutrient absorption and energy homeostasis, efforts should be made to reduce their ubiquity and current levels of consumption.

When you eat beans you get resistant starch, by the time some of the resistant starch gets broken down(and gets transformed in short chain fatty acids) it's too far in the intestine to be absorbed and it ends in the toilet bowl, less fat for you. This resistant starch feeds a type of bacteria that slows the absorption of glucose, so if you eat white rice your glycemic index is not as high. The bacteria stays for a while depending on how much and how often you have beans in your diet also it has anti cancer properties.

When you eat food without nutrition like processed food(pleasure trap food) your body will make you crave for more food to get the nutrition it needs but if you eat crappy food it won't matter.

// Folic acid bad, Folate good
Foods with folic acid not so good

Folatul si acidul folic sunt diferite forme de vitamina B9. Desi exista o diferenta distincta intre cele doua, numele lor sunt adesea substituite si folosite in mod gresit. De fapt, chiar si in randul profesionistilor exista o multime de confuzii in ceea ce priveste acidul folic si folatul.

Acest articol explica diferenta dintre acid folic si folat si va prezinta solutiile pe care le aveti indemana pentru a beneficia pe deplin de beneficiile vitaminei B9 in timpul sarcinii si nu numai.

Vitamina B9
Vitamina B9 este un nutrient esential, care joaca un rol crucial in dezvoltarea celulelor si in formarea ADN-ului. Nivelurile scazute de vitamina B9 sunt asociate cu:

Homocisteina crescuta. Nivelurile ridicate de homocisteina au fost asociate cu un risc crescut de boli de inima si accident vascular cerebral.
Defecte de nastere. Nivelurile scazute de folat la femeile gravide au fost legate de anomalii la nastere, cum ar fi defectele tubului neural.
Riscul de cancer. Nivelurile slabe de folat sunt, de asemenea, legate de riscul crescut de cancer.
Din aceste motive, suplimentarea cu vitamina B9 este o practica uzuala. Fortificarea alimentelor cu acest nutrient este obligatorie in multe tari, inclusiv in Statele Unite si Canada.

Ce este folatul?
Folatul este forma naturala a vitaminei B9. Numele de folat este derivat din cuvantul latin "folium", care inseamna frunza. De fapt, legumele cu frunze sunt printre cele mai bune surse alimentare de folat.

Forma activa a vitaminei B9 este un folat cunoscut sub numele de 5-metiltetrahidrofolat (5-MTHF). In sistemul digestiv, majoritatea folatului alimentar este transformat in 5-MTHF inainte de a intra in fluxul sanguin.

Ce este acidul folic?
Acidul folic este o forma sintetica a vitaminei B9, cunoscuta si sub denumirea de acid pteroilmonoglutamic. Este folosit in suplimente si adaugat la produsele alimentare procesate, cum ar fi faina si cerealele pentru micul dejun.

Spre deosebire de folat, nu tot acidul folic pe care il consumi este transformat in forma activa a vitaminei B9 (5-MTHF) in sistemul tau digestiv. In schimb, trebuie sa fie convertit in ficat sau in alte tesuturi. Astfel, acidul folic obisnuit trebuie sa treaca prin mai multe transformari biochimice pentru a ajunge in forma biologic activa, pe care organismul o poate utiliza. Pana la 50% dintre femei nu pot metaboliza acidul folic astfel incat acestea nu beneficiaza pe deplin de efectele sale favorabile.

Ce este MTHFR?
Metabolizarea acidului folic sintetic este un proces este lent si ineficient la unii oameni. Dupa ce ai luat un supliment de acid folic, este nevoie de timp pentru ca organismul sa il transforme in 5-MTHF. Acesta este un proces in patru etape care necesita mai multe enzime, inclusiv una numita MTHFR, care gestioneaza defalcarea acidului folic sintetic. Aceasta defalcare duce la niveluri crescute de homocisteina. Homocisteina este un produs chimic produs dintr-un aminoacid din corpul nostru cand acidul folic se descompune. Daca acidul folic nu este descompus, acesta va bloca capacitatea organismului de a avea suficienti folati.

Unii oameni au mutatii genetice care fac ca enzimele MTHFR sa fie mai putin eficiente in transformarea acidului folic in 5-MTHF. Acest lucru poate duce la acumularea de acid folic in sange, care poate avea efecte negative asupra sanatatii. Chiar si o doza mica, cum ar fi 200-400 mcg pe zi, poate sa nu fie complet metabolizata pana la administrarea urmatoarei doze. Aceasta problema poate sa se agraveze atunci cand alimentele fortificate sunt consumate impreuna cu suplimente de acid folic. Drept urmare, acidul folic nemetabolizat este frecvent detectat in fluxurile de sange ale persoanelor care folosesc suplimente obisnuite de acid folic sintetic.

Acesta este un motiv de ingrijorare, deoarece nivelurile ridicate de acid folic nemetabolizat au fost asociate cu mai multe probleme de sanatate, incluzand imunitatea slaba, functionare redusa a creierului si cresterea crescuta a cancerelor preexistente, deficienta nedetectata de vitamina B12, care, lasata netratata, poate creste riscul de dementa si afecteaza functionarea sistemului nervos.

Cum este influentata sarcina de mutatiile MTHFR?
Aportul de folat activ este deosebit de important pentru formarea si dezvoltarea noilor celule, pentru sinteza ADN si ARN, embrionul uman fiind mai sensibil la deficitul de folat fata de o persoana adulta.

Femeile insarcinate care au o mutatie a genei MTHFR pot avea complicatii in timpul sarcinii. Deficitul de folat in organismul mamei poate conduce la malformatii ale fatului, cunoscute mai ales sub denumirea de defecte de tub neural (DTN). Acestea pot aparea in saptamanile 3 - 4 de sarcina si se manifesta prin neinchiderea completa a tubului neural (formatiune embrionara din care se va dezvolta sistemul nervos – la extremitatea superioara luand nastere encefalul iar din partea mijlocie si inferioara a tubului neural se formeaza maduva spinarii).

Inchiderea tubului neural are loc in mai multe etape - intr-o prima faza acesta se inchide la mijloc, urmeaza apoi partea superioara, iar la final se inchide in partea inferioara. Atunci cand fuziunea este incompleta, rezulta mai multe malformatii la nivelul creierului sau a maduvei spinarii, printre care:

Spina bifida. Acesta este un defect de nastere in care oasele coloanei vertebrale nu se dezvolta corespunzator si nu acopera integral maduva spinarii, lasand-o expusa. In functie de severitatea spinei bifide, unii copii continua sa aiba viata normala, in timp ce altii au nevoie de ingrijire cu norma intreaga.
Anencefalia. Acesta este un defect grav la nastere in care un copil se naste fara parti ale creierului sau craniului. In acest caz, speranta de viata a majoritatii bebelusilor nu este mai mare de o saptamana.
Encefalocelul. Aceasta se manifesta prin exteriorizarea tesutului nervos si a meningelului printr-un defect de os cranian.
Cea mai buna solutie terapeutica este prevenirea DTN prin administrarea zilnica de acid folic, incepand din perioada de planificare a sarcinii, intrucat aportul de folat activ trebuie asigurat inca din momentul conceptiei. Tubul neural al fatului incepe sa se dezvolte intre zilele a 21-a si a 28-a de la momentul conceptiei, ori, de multe ori, viitoarea mama nici macar nu stie ca este insarcinata.

How Not to Die Michael Greger

Dr. Ornish and his colleagues’ studies were published in some of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Yet medical practice hardly changed. Why? Why were doctors still prescribing drugs and using Roto-Rooter-type procedures to just treat the symptoms of heart disease and to try to forestall what they chose to believe was the inevitable—an early death?

This was my wake-up call. I opened my eyes to the depressing fact that there are other forces at work in medicine besides science. The U.S. health care system runs on a fee-for-service model in which doctors get paid for the pills and procedures they prescribe, rewarding quantity over quality. We don’t get reimbursed for time spent counseling our patients about the benefits of healthy eating. If doctors were instead paid for performance, there would be a financial incentive to treat the lifestyle causes of disease. Until the model of reimbursement changes, I don’t expect great changes in medical care or medical education.5

Only a quarter of medical schools appear to offer a single dedicated course on nutrition.6 During my first interview for medical school, at Cornell University, I remember the interviewer emphatically stating, “Nutrition is superfluous to human health.” And he was a pediatrician! I knew I was in for a long road ahead. Come to think of it, I think the only medical professional who ever asked me about a family member’s diet was our veterinarian.

I was honored to be accepted by nineteen medical schools. I chose Tufts because they boasted the most nutrition training—twenty-one hours’ worth, although this was still less than 1 percent of the curriculum.

*************************************************
During my medical training, I was offered countless steak dinners and fancy perks by Big Pharma representatives, but not once did I get a call from Big Broccoli. There is a reason you hear about the latest drugs on television: Huge corporate budgets drive their promotion. The same reason you’ll probably never see a commercial for sweet potatoes is the same reason breakthroughs on the power of foods to affect your health and longevity may never make it to the public: There’s little profit motive.

In medical school, even with our paltry twenty-one hours of nutrition training, there was no mention of using diet to treat chronic disease, let alone reverse it. I was only aware of this body of work because of my family’s personal story.

The question that haunted me during training was this: If the cure to our number-one killer could get lost down the rabbit hole, what else might be buried in the medical literature? I made it my life’s mission to find out.


//
As corrupting an influence as money is in medicine, it appears to me even worse in the field of nutrition, where it seems everyone has his or her own brand of snake-oil supplement or wonder gadget. Dogmas are entrenched and data too often cherry-picked to support preconceived notions.

//**********************************************************************************************
When it comes to safe, simple lifestyle prescriptions, I’m realizing it may be more effective to empower individuals directly. In a recent national survey of doctor office visits, only about one in five smokers were told to quit.7 Just as you don’t have to wait for your physician to tell you to stop smoking, you don’t have to wait to start eating healthier.


//
There may be no such thing as dying from old age. From a study of more than forty-two thousand consecutive autopsies, centenarians—those who live past one hundred—were found to have succumbed to diseases in 100 percent of the cases examined. Though most were perceived, even by their physicians, to have been healthy just prior to death, not one “died of old age.”1 Until recently, advanced age had been considered to be a disease itself,2 but people don’t die as a consequence of maturing. They die from disease, most commonly heart attacks.3

Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and they are related to what we eat.4 Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one cause of disability.5 Surely, diet must also be the number-one thing taught in medical schools, right?

***********************************************************
Sadly, it’s not. According to the most recent national survey, only a quarter of medical schools offer a single course in nutrition, down from 37 percent thirty years ago.6 While most of the public evidently considers doctors to be “very credible” sources of nutrition information,7 six out of seven graduating doctors surveyed felt physicians were inadequately trained to counsel patients about their diets.8 One study found that people off the street sometimes know more about basic nutrition than their doctors, concluding “physicians should be more knowledgeable about nutrition than their patients, but these results suggest that this is not necessarily true.”

To remedy this situation, a bill was introduced in the California State Legislature to mandate physicians get at least twelve hours of nutrition training any time over the next four years. It might surprise you to learn that the California Medical Association came out strongly opposed to the bill, as did other mainstream medical groups, including the California Academy of Family Physicians.10 The bill was amended from a mandatory minimum of twelve hours over four years down to seven hours and then doctored, one might say, down to zero.

The California medical board does have one subject requirement: twelve hours on pain management and end-of-life care for the terminally ill.11 This disparity between prevention and mere mitigation of suffering could be a metaphor for modern medicine. A doctor a day may keep the apples away.

A study of thousands of patient visits found that the average length of time primary-care doctors spend talking about nutrition is about ten seconds.

//
But hey, this is the twenty-first century! Can’t we eat whatever we want and simply take meds when we begin having health problems? For too many patients and even my physician colleagues, this seems to be the prevailing mind-set. Global spending for prescription drugs is surpassing $1 trillion annually, with the United States accounting for about one-third of this market.14 Why do we spend so much on pills? Many people assume that our manner of death is preprogrammed into our genes. High blood pressure by fifty-five, heart attacks at sixty, maybe cancer at seventy, and so on.… But for most of the leading causes of death, the science shows that our genes often account for only 10–20 percent of risk at most.15 For instance, as you’ll see in this book, the rates of killers like heart disease and major cancers differ up to a hundredfold among various populations around the globe. But when people move from low- to high-risk countries, their disease rates almost always change to those of the new environment.16 New diet, new diseases. So, while a sixty-year-old American man living in San Francisco has about a 5 percent chance of having a heart attack within five years, should he move to Japan and start eating and living like the Japanese, his five-year risk would drop to only 1 percent. Japanese Americans in their forties can have the same heart attack risk as Japanese in their sixties. Switching to an American lifestyle in effect aged their hearts a full twenty years.17

**********************************************************
The Mayo Clinic estimates that nearly 70 percent of Americans take at least one prescription drug.18 Yet despite the fact that more people in this country are on medication than aren’t, not to mention the steady influx of ever newer and more expensive drugs on the market, we aren’t living much longer than others. In terms of life expectancy, the United States is down around twenty-seven or twenty-eight out of the thirty-four top free-market democracies. People in Slovenia live longer than we do.19 And the extra years we are living aren’t necessarily healthy or vibrant. Back in 2011, a disturbing analysis of mortality and morbidity was published in the Journal of Gerontology. Are Americans living longer now compared to about a generation ago? Yes, technically. But are those extra years necessarily healthy ones? No. And it’s worse than that: We’re actually living fewer healthy years now than we once did.

The researchers also noted that we’re living two fewer functional years—that is, for two years, we’re no longer able to perform basic life activities, such as walking a quarter of a mile, standing or sitting for two hours without having to lie down, or standing without special equipment.21 In other words, we’re living longer, but we’re living sicker.

With these rising disease rates, our children may even die sooner. A special report published in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled “A Potential Decline in Life Expectancy in the United States in the 21st Century” concluded that “the steady rise in life expectancy observed in the modern era may soon come to an end and the youth of today may, on average, live less healthy and possibly even shorter lives than their parents.”2

//
In public health school, students learn that there are three levels of preventive medicine. The first is primary prevention, as in trying to prevent people at risk for heart disease from suffering their first heart attack. An example of this level of preventive medicine would be your doctor prescribing you a statin drug for high cholesterol. Secondary prevention takes place when you already have the disease and are trying to prevent it from becoming worse, like having a second heart attack. To do this, your doctor may add an aspirin or other drugs to your regimen. At the third level of preventive medicine, the focus is on helping people manage long-term health problems, so your doctor, for example, might prescribe a cardiac rehabilitation program that aims to prevent further physical deterioration and pain.23 In 2000, a fourth level was proposed. What could this new “quaternary” prevention be? Reduce the complications from all the drugs and surgery from the first three levels.24 But people seem to forget about a fifth concept, termed primordial prevention, that was first introduced by the World Health Organization back in 1978. Decades later, it’s finally being embraced by the American Heart Association.25

//*****************************************************
Primordial prevention was conceived as a strategy to prevent whole societies from experiencing epidemics of chronic-disease risk factors. This means not just preventing chronic disease but preventing the risk factors that lead to chronic disease.26 For example, instead of trying to prevent someone with high cholesterol from suffering a heart attack, why not help prevent him or her from getting high cholesterol (which leads to the heart attack) in the first place?

//
An analysis of the health behaviors of thirty-five thousand adults across the United States was published in the American Heart Association journal. Most of the participants didn’t smoke, about half reached their weekly exercise goals, and about a third of the population got a pass in each of the other categories—except diet. Their diets were scored on a scale from zero to five to see if they met a bare minimum of healthy eating behaviors, such as meeting recommended targets for fruit, vegetable, and whole-grain consumption or drinking fewer than three cans of soda a week. How many even reached four out of five on their Healthy Eating Score? About 1 percent.


//
Medical anthropologists have identified several major eras of human disease, starting with the Age of Pestilence and Famine, which largely ended with the Industrial Revolution, or the stage we’re in now, the Age of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases.33 This shift is reflected in the changing causes of death over the last century. In 1900 in the United States, the top-three killers were infectious diseases: pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrheal disease.34 Now, the killers are largely lifestyle diseases: heart disease, cancer, and chronic lung disease.35 Is this simply because antibiotics have enabled us to live long enough to suffer from degenerative diseases? No. The emergence of these epidemics of chronic disease was accompanied by dramatic shifts in dietary patterns. This is best exemplified by what’s been happening to disease rates among people in the developing world over the last few decades as they’ve rapidly Westernized their diets.


In 1990 around the world, most years of healthy life were lost to undernutrition, such as diarrheal diseases in malnourished children, but now the greatest disease burden is attributed to high blood pressure, a disease of overnutrition.36 The pandemic of chronic disease has been ascribed in part to the near-universal shift toward a diet dominated by animal-sourced and processed foods—in other words, more meat, dairy, eggs, oils, soda, sugar, and refined grains.37 China is perhaps the best-studied example. There, a transition away from the country’s traditional, plant-based diet was accompanied by a sharp rise in diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.

Why do we suspect these changes in diet and disease are related? After all, rapidly industrializing societies undergo multitudes of changes. How are scientists able to parse out the effects of specific foods? To isolate the effects of different dietary components, researchers can follow the diets and diseases of large groups of defined individuals over time. Take meat, for example. To see what effect an increase in meat consumption might have on disease rates, researchers studied lapsed vegetarians. People who once ate vegetarian diets but then started to eat meat at least once a week experienced a 146 percent increase in odds of heart disease, a 152 percent increase in stroke, a 166 percent increase in diabetes, and a 231 percent increase in odds for weight gain. During the twelve years after the transition from vegetarian to omnivore, meat-eating was associated with a 3.6 year decrease in life expectancy.39

Even vegetarians can suffer high rates of chronic disease, though, if they eat a lot of processed foods. Take India, for example. This country’s rates of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and stroke have increased far faster than might have been expected given its relatively small increase in per capita meat consumption. This has been blamed on the decreasing “whole plant food content of their diet,” including a shift from brown rice to white and the substitution of other refined carbohydrates, packaged snacks, and fast-food products for India’s traditional staples of lentils, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds.40 In general, the dividing line between health-promoting and disease-promoting foods may be less plant- versus animal-sourced foods and more whole plant foods versus most everything else.

*********************
Sadly, most Americans hardly make it past a score of ten. The standard American diet rates eleven out of one hundred. According to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 32 percent of our calories comes from animal foods, 57 percent comes from processed plant foods, and only 11 percent comes from whole grains, beans, fruits, vegetables, and nuts.47 That means on a scale of one to ten, the American diet would rate about a one.

***********************
We eat almost as if the future doesn’t matter. And, indeed, there are actually data to back that up. A study entitled “Death Row Nutrition: Curious Conclusions of Last Meals” analyzed the last meal requests of hundreds of individuals executed in the United States during a five-year period. It turns out that the nutritional content didn’t differ much from what Americans normally eat.48 If we continue to eat as though we’re having our last meals, eventually they will be.


What percentage of Americans hit all the American Heart Association’s “Simple 7” recommendations? Of 1,933 men and women surveyed, most met two or three, but hardly any managed to meet all seven simple health components. In fact, just a single individual could boast hitting all seven recommendations.49 One person out of nearly two thousand. As a recent past president of the American Heart Association responded, “That should give all of us pause.”50

The truth is that adhering to just four simple healthy lifestyle factors can have a strong impact on the prevention of chronic diseases: not smoking, not being obese, getting a half hour of exercise a day, and eating healthier—defined as consuming more fruits, veggies, and whole grains and less meat. Those four factors alone were found to account for 78 percent of chronic disease risk. If you start from scratch and manage to tick off all four, you may be able to wipe out more than 90 percent of your risk of developing diabetes, more than 80 percent of your risk of having a heart attack, cut by half your risk of having a stroke, and reduce your overall cancer risk by more than one-third.51 For some cancers, like our number-two cancer killer, colon cancer, up to 71 percent of cases appear to be preventable through a similar portfolio of simple diet and lifestyle changes.52

Maybe it’s time we stop blaming genetics and focus on the more than 70 percent that is directly under our control.53 We have the power.

//
Does all this healthy living translate into a longer life as well? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) followed approximately eight thousand Americans aged twenty years or older for about six years. They found that three cardinal lifestyle behaviors exerted an enormous impact on mortality: People can substantially reduce their risk for early death by not smoking, consuming a healthier diet, and engaging in sufficient physical activity. And the CDC’s definitions were pretty laid-back: By not smoking, the CDC just meant not currently smoking. A “healthy diet” was defined merely as being in the top 40 percent in terms 
of complying with the wimpy federal dietary guidelines, and “physically active” meant averaging about twenty-one minutes or more a day of at least moderate exercise. People who managed at least one of the three had a 40 percent lower risk of dying within that six-year period. Those who hit two out of three cut their chances of dying by more than half, and those who scored all three behaviors reduced their chances of dying in that time by 82 percent.

Of course, people sometimes fib about how well they eat. How accurate can these findings really be if they’re based on people’s self-reporting? A similar study on health behaviors and survival didn’t just take people’s own word for how healthy they were eating; the researchers measured how much vitamin C participants had in their bloodstreams. The level of vitamin C in the blood was considered a “good biomarker of plant food intake” and hence was used as a proxy for a healthy diet. The conclusions held up. The drop in mortality risk among those with healthier habits was equivalent to being fourteen years younger.55 It’s like turning back the clock fourteen years—not with a drug or a DeLorean but just by eating and living healthier.

Let’s talk a little more about aging. In each of your cells, you have forty-six strands of DNA coiled into chromosomes. At the tip of each chromosome, there’s a tiny cap called a telomere, which keeps your DNA from unraveling and fraying. Think of it as the plastic tips on the end of your shoelaces. Every time your cells divide, however, a bit of that cap is lost. And when the telomere is completely gone, your cells can die.56 Though this is an oversimplification,57 telomeres have been thought of as your life “fuse”: They can start shortening as soon as you’re born, and when they’re gone, you’re gone. In fact, forensic scientists can take DNA from a bloodstain and roughly estimate how old the person was based on how long their telomeres are.58

Sounds like fodder for a great scene in CSI, but is there anything you can do to slow the rate at which your fuses burn? The thought is that if you can slow down this ticking cellular clock, you may be able to slow down the aging process and live longer.59 So what would you have to do if you wanted to prevent this telomere cap from burning away? Well, smoking cigarettes is associated with triple the rate of telomere loss,60 so the first step is simple: Stop smoking. But the food you eat every day may also have an impact on how fast you lose your telomeres. The consumption of fruits,61 vegetables,62 and other antioxidant-rich foods63 has been associated with longer protective telomeres. In contrast, the consumption of refined grains,64 soda,65 meat (including fish),66 and dairy67 has been linked to shortened telomeres. What if you ate a diet composed of whole plant foods and stayed away from processed foods and animal foods? Could cellular aging be slowed?

// This is not me saying bullshit, somebody actually got a Noble prize for this. I am not making stuff up. 
The answer lies in an enzyme found in Methuselah. That’s the name given to a bristlecone pine tree growing in the White Mountains of California, which, at the time, happened to be the oldest recorded living being and is now nearing its 4,800th birthday. It was already hundreds of years old before construction of the pyramids in Egypt began. There’s an enzyme in the roots of bristlecone pines that appears to peak a few thousand years into their life span, and it actually rebuilds telomeres.68 Scientists named it telomerase. Once they knew what to look for, researchers discovered the enzyme was present in human cells too. The question then became, how can we boost the activity of this age-defying enzyme?

Seeking answers, the pioneering researcher Dr. Dean Ornish teamed up with Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn, who was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Medicine for her discovery of telomerase. In a study funded in part by the U.S. Department of Defense, they found that three months of whole-food, plant-based nutrition and other healthy changes could significantly boost telomerase activity, the only intervention ever shown to do so.69 The study was published in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. The accompanying editorial concluded that this landmark study “should encourage people to adopt a healthy lifestyle in order to avoid or combat cancer and age-related diseases.”

So were Dr. Ornish and Dr. Blackburn able to successfully slow down aging with a healthy diet and lifestyle? A five-year follow-up study was recently published in which the lengths of the study subjects’ telomeres were measured. In the control group (the group of participants who did not change their lifestyles), their telomeres predictably shrank with age. But for the healthy-living group, not only did their telomeres shrink less, they grew. Five years later, their telomeres were even longer on average than when they started, suggesting a healthy lifestyle can boost telomerase enzyme activity and reverse cellular aging.71

Subsequent research has shown that the telomere lengthening wasn’t just because the healthy-living group was exercising more or losing weight. Weight loss through calorie restriction and an even more vigorous exercise program failed to improve telomere length, so it appears that the active ingredient is the quality, not quantity, of the food eaten. As long as people were eating the same diet, it didn’t appear to matter how small their portions were, how much weight they lost, or even how hard they exercised; after a year, they saw no benefit.72 In contrast, individuals on the plant-based diet exercised only half as much, enjoyed the same amount of weight loss after just three months,73 and achieved significant telomere protection.74 In other words, it wasn’t the weight loss and it wasn’t the exercise that reversed cell aging—it was the food.

Some people have expressed concern that boosting telomerase activity could theoretically increase cancer risk, since tumors have been known to hijack the telomerase enzyme and use it to ensure their own immortality.75 But as we’ll see in chapter 13, Dr. Ornish and his colleagues have used the same diet and lifestyle changes to halt and apparently reverse the progression of cancer in certain circumstances. We will also see how the same diet can reverse heart disease too.

What about our other leading killers? It turns out a more plant-based diet may help prevent, treat, or reverse every single one of our fifteen leading causes of death. In this book, I’ll go through this list, with a chapter on each:

Certainly there are prescription medications that can help with some of these conditions. For example, you can take statin drugs for your cholesterol to lower risk of heart attacks, pop different pills and inject insulin for diabetes, and take a slew of diuretics and other blood pressure medications for hypertension. But there is only one unifying diet that may help prevent, arrest, or even reverse each of these killers. Unlike with medications, there isn’t one kind of diet for optimal liver function and a different diet to improve our kidneys. A heart-healthy diet is a brain-healthy diet is a lung-healthy diet. The same diet that helps prevent cancer just so happens to be the same diet that may help prevent type 2 diabetes and every other cause of death on the top-fifteen list. 

Unlike drugs—which only target specific functions, can have dangerous side effects, and may only treat the symptoms of disease—a healthy diet can benefit all organ systems at once, has good side effects, and may treat the underlying cause of illness.

// Talk about That study where Americans that ate normally (that ate meat, dairy, and plant food(I actually can't remember how much processed food they ate)) where better than vegetarians and vegetarians were better that vegans. I was shocked, vegans were the worst when they were supposed to be the best. So scientist tried to find out why. It was simple, people were not informed about what a healthy diet was supposed to be and they replaced meat and dairy with processed foods.
******************************************
That one unifying diet found to best prevent and treat many of these chronic diseases is a whole-food, plant-based diet, defined as an eating pattern that encourages the consumption of unrefined plant foods and discourages meats, dairy products, eggs, and processed foods.92 In this book, I don’t advocate for a vegetarian diet or a vegan diet. I advocate for an evidence-based diet, and the best available balance of science suggests that the more whole plant foods we eat, the better—both to reap their nutritional benefits and to displace less healthful options.

Most doctor visits are for lifestyle-based diseases, which means they’re preventable diseases.93 As physicians, my colleagues and I were trained not to treat the root cause but rather the consequences by giving a lifetime’s worth of medications to treat risk factors like high blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol. This approach has been compared to mopping up the floor around an overflowing sink instead of simply turning off the faucet.94 Drug companies are more than happy to sell you a new roll of paper towels every day for the rest of your life while the water continues to gush. As Dr. Walter Willett, the chair of nutrition at Harvard University’s School of Public Health, put it: “The inherent problem is that most pharmacologic strategies do not address the underlying causes of ill health in Western countries, which are not drug deficiencies.”95

Treating the cause is not only safer and cheaper but it can work better. So why don’t more of my medical colleagues do it? Not only were they not trained how, doctors don’t get paid for it. No one profits from lifestyle medicine (other than the patient!), so it’s not a major part of medical training or practice.96 That’s just how the current system works. The medical system is set up to financially reward prescribing pills and procedures, not produce. After Dr. Ornish proved that heart disease could be reversed without drugs or surgery, he thought that his studies would have a meaningful effect on the practice of mainstream 
medicine. After all, he effectively found a cure for our number-one killer! But he was mistaken—not about his critically important findings regarding diet and disease reversal but about how much influence the business of medicine has on the practice of medicine. In his words, Dr. Ornish “realized reimbursement is a much more powerful determinant of medical practice than research.

Though there are vested interests, such as the processed food and pharmaceutical industries, which fight hard to maintain the status quo, there is one corporate sector that actually benefits from keeping people healthy—namely, the insurance industry. Kaiser Permanente, the largest managed-care organization in the country, published a nutritional update for physicians in their official medical journal, informing their nearly fifteen thousand physicians that healthy eating may be “best achieved with a plant-based diet, which we define as a regimen that encourages whole, plant-based foods and discourages meats, dairy products, and eggs as well as all refined and processed foods.”98

“Too often, physicians ignore the potential benefits of good nutrition and quickly prescribe medications instead of giving patients a chance to correct their disease through healthy eating and active living.… Physicians should consider recommending a plant-based diet to all their patients, especially those with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or obesity.”99 Physicians should give their patients a chance to first correct their disease themselves with plant-based nutrition.

The major downside Kaiser Permanente’s nutritional update describes is that this diet may work a little too well. If people begin eating plant-based diets while still taking medications, their blood pressure or blood sugar could actually drop so low that physicians may need to adjust medications or eliminate them altogether. Ironically, the “side effect” of the diet may be not having to take drugs anymore. The article ends with a familiar refrain: Further research is needed. In this case, though, “Further research is needed to find ways to make plant-based diets the new normal.…

//*****************************************************
The primary reason diseases tend to run in families may be that diets tend to run in families.

For most of our leading killers, nongenetic factors like diet can account for at least 80 or 90 percent of cases. As I noted before, this is based on the fact that the rates of cardiovascular disease and major cancers differ fivefold to a hundredfold around the world. Migration studies show this is not just genetics. When people move from low- to high-risk areas, their disease risk nearly always shoots up to match the new setting.101 As well, dramatic changes in disease rates within a single generation highlight the primacy of external factors. Colon cancer mortality in Japan in the 1950s was less than one-fifth that of the United States (including Americans of Japanese ancestry).102 But now colon cancer rates in Japan are as bad as they are in the United States, a rise that has been attributed in part to the fivefold increase in meat consumption.

Research has shown us that identical twins separated at birth will get different diseases based on how they live their lives. A recent American Heart Association–funded study compared the lifestyles and arteries of nearly five hundred twins. It found that diet and lifestyle factors clearly trumped genes.104 You share 50 percent of your genes with each of your parents, so if one parent dies of a heart attack, you know you’ve inherited some of that susceptibility. But even among identical twins who have the exact same genes, one could die early of a heart attack and the other could live a long, healthy life with clean arteries depending on what she ate and how she lived. Even if both your parents died with heart disease, you should be able to eat your way to a healthy heart. Your family history does not have to become your personal destiny.

Cancer cells can use epigenetics against us by silencing tumor-suppressor genes that could otherwise stop the cancer in its tracks. So even if you’re born with good genes, cancer can sometimes find a way to turn them off. A number of chemotherapy drugs have been developed to restore our bodies’ natural defenses, but their use has been limited due to their high toxicity.107 There are, however, a number of compounds distributed widely throughout the plant kingdom—including beans, greens, and berries—that appear to have the same effect naturally.108 For example, dripping green tea on colon, esophageal, or prostate cancer cells has been shown to reactivate genes silenced by the cancer.109 This hasn’t just been demonstrated in a petri dish, though. Three hours after eating a cup of broccoli sprouts, the enzyme that cancers use to help silence our defenses is suppressed in your bloodstream110 to an extent equal to or greater than the chemotherapy agent specifically designed for that purpose,111 without the toxic side effects.

What if we ate a diet chock-full of plant foods? In the Gene Expression Modulation by Intervention with Nutrition and Lifestyle (GEMINAL) study, Dr. Ornish and colleagues took biopsies from men with prostate cancer before and after three months of intensive lifestyle changes that included a whole-food, plant-based diet. Without any chemotherapy or radiation, beneficial changes in gene expression for five hundred different genes were noted. Within just a few months, the expression of disease-preventing genes was boosted, and oncogenes that promote breast and prostate cancer were suppressed.113 Whatever genes we may have inherited from our parents, what we eat can affect how those genes affect our health. The power is mainly in our hands and on our plates.

//
Imagine if terrorists created a bioagent that spread mercilessly, claiming the lives of nearly four hundred thousand Americans every year. That is the equivalent of one person every eighty-three seconds, every hour, around the clock, year after year. The pandemic would be front-page news all day, every day. We’d marshal the army and march our finest medical minds into a room to figure out a cure for this bioterror plague. In short, we’d stop at nothing until the terrorists were stopped.

Fortunately, we’re not actually losing hundreds of thousands of people each year to a preventable threat … are we?

Actually, we are. This particular biological weapon may not be a germ released by terrorists, but it kills more Americans annually than have all our past wars combined. It can be stopped not in a laboratory but right in our grocery stores, kitchens, and dining rooms. As far as weapons go, we don’t need vaccines or antibiotics. A simple fork will do.

So what’s going on here? If this epidemic is present on such a massive scale, yet so preventable, why aren’t we doing more about it?

The killer I’m talking about is coronary heart disease, and it’s affecting nearly everyone raised on the standard American diet.


//
Our Top Killer

America’s number-one killer is a different kind of terrorist: fatty deposits in the walls of your arteries called atherosclerotic plaque. For most Americans raised on a conventional diet, plaque accumulates inside the coronary arteries—the blood vessels that crown the heart (hence “coronary”) and supply it with oxygen-rich blood. This buildup of plaque, known as atherosclerosis, from the Greek words athere (gruel) and sklerosis (hardening), is the hardening of the arteries by pockets of cholesterol-rich gunk that builds up within the inner linings of the blood vessels. This process occurs over decades, slowly bulging into the space inside the arteries, narrowing the path for blood to flow. The restriction of blood circulation to the heart muscle can lead to chest pain and pressure, known as angina, when people try to exert themselves. If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form within the artery. This sudden blockage of blood flow can cause a heart attack, damaging or even killing part of the heart.

When you think about heart disease, you may think of friends or loved ones who suffered for years with chest pain and shortness of breath before they finally succumbed. However, for the majority of Americans who die suddenly from heart disease, the very first symptom may be their last.1 It’s called “sudden cardiac death.” This is when death occurs within an hour of symptom onset. In other words, you may not even realize you’re at risk until it’s too late. You could be feeling perfectly fine one moment, and then an hour later, you’re gone forever. That’s why it’s critical to prevent heart disease in the first place, before you even necessarily know you have it.

My patients often asked me, “Isn’t heart disease just a consequence of getting old?” I can see why this is a common misconception. After all, your heart pumps literally billions of times during the average life span. Does your ticker just conk out after a while? No.

A large body of evidence shows there were once enormous swaths of the world where the epidemic of coronary heart disease simply didn’t exist. For instance, in the famous China-Cornell-Oxford Project (known as the China Study), researchers investigated the eating habits and incidence of chronic disease among hundreds of thousands of rural Chinese. In Guizhou province, for example, a region comprising half a million people, over the course of three years, not a single death could be attributed to coronary artery disease among men under sixty-five.2

During the 1930s and 1940s, Western-trained doctors working throughout an extensive network of missionary hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa noticed that many of the chronic diseases laying waste to populations in the so-called developed world were largely absent across most of the continent. In Uganda, a country of millions in eastern Africa, coronary heart disease was described as “almost non-existent.”3

But were the people of these nations simply dying early of other diseases, never living long enough to come down with heart disease? No. The doctors compared autopsies of Ugandans to autopsies of Americans who had died at the same age. The researchers found that out of 632 people autopsied in Saint Louis, Missouri, there had been 136 heart attacks. But in 632 age-matched Ugandans? A single heart attack. The Ugandans experienced more than one hundred times fewer heart attacks than the Americans. The doctors were so blown away that they examined another 800 deaths in Uganda. Out of more than 1,400 Ugandans autopsied, researchers found just one body with a small, healed lesion of the heart, meaning the attack wasn’t even fatal. Then and now, in the industrialized world, heart disease is a leading killer. In central Africa, heart disease was so rare it killed fewer than one in a thousand.4

Immigration studies show that this resistance to heart disease is not just something in the Africans’ genes. When people move from low-risk to high-risk areas, their disease rates skyrocket as they adopt the diet and lifestyle habits of their new homes.5 The extraordinarily low rates of heart disease in rural China and Africa have been attributed to the extraordinarily low cholesterol levels among these populations. Though Chinese and African diets are very different, they share commonalities: They are both centered on plant-derived foods, such as grains and vegetables. By eating so much fiber and so little animal fat, their total cholesterol levels averaged under 150 mg/dL,6,7 similar to people who eat contemporary plant-based diets.8

So what does all of this mean? It means heart disease may be a choice.

If you looked at the teeth of people who lived more than ten thousand years before the invention of the toothbrush, you’d notice they had almost no cavities.9 They never flossed a day in their lives, yet no cavities. That’s because candy bars hadn’t been invented yet. The reason people get cavities now is that the pleasure they derive from sugary treats may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist’s chair. I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence—I’ve got a good dental plan! But what if instead of the dental plaque on our teeth, we’re talking about the atherosclerotic plaque building up in our arteries? We’re not just talking about scraping tartar anymore. We’re talking about life and death.

Heart disease is the number-one reason we and most of our loved ones will die. Of course, it’s up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live, but shouldn’t we try to make these choices consciously by educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions? Just as we could avoid sugary foods that rot our teeth, we can avoid the trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol-laden foods that clog up our arteries.

Let’s take a look at the progression of coronary heart disease throughout life and learn how simple dietary choices at any stage may prevent, stop, and even reverse heart disease before it’s too late.

//
Is Fish Oil Just Snake Oil?

Thanks in part to the American Heart Association’s recommendation that individuals at high risk for heart disease should ask their physicians about omega-3 fish oil supplementation,10 fish oil pills have grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. We now consume more than one hundred thousand tons of fish oil every year.11

But what does the science say? Are the purported benefits of fish oil supplementation for the prevention and treatment of heart disease just a fish tale? A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at all the best randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of omega-3 fats on life span, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke. These included studies not only on fish oil supplements but also studies on the effects of advising people to eat more oily fish. What did they find? Overall, the researchers found no protective benefit for overall mortality, heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death, heart attack, or stroke.12

What about for someone who had already had a heart attack and is trying to prevent another? Still no benefit was found.13

Where did we even get this idea that the omega-3 fats in fish and fish oil supplements are good for you? There was a notion that Eskimos were protected from heart disease, but that appears to be a complete myth.14 Some early studies, however, looked promising. For example, the famous DART trial from the 1980s involving two thousand men found that those advised to eat fatty fish had a 29 percent reduction in mortality.15 That’s impressive, so it’s no wonder the study got a lot of attention. But people seem to have forgotten about the sequel, the DART-2 trial, which found the exact opposite. Run by the same group of researchers, the DART-2 trial was an even bigger study—three thousand men—but this time, participants advised to eat oily fish and particularly those who were supplied with fish oil capsules had a higher risk of cardiac death.16,17

After putting all the studies together, researchers concluded that there was no longer justification for the use of omega-3s in everyday clinical practice.18 What should doctors do when their patients follow the American Heart Association’s advice and inquire about fish oil supplements? As the director of Lipids and Metabolism at Mount Sinai’s cardiovascular institute put it: “Given this and other negative meta-analyses, our job [as doctors] should be to stop highly marketed fish oil supplementation to all our patients…”


//
Heart Disease Starts in Childhood

In 1953, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association radically changed our understanding of the development of heart disease. Researchers conducted a series of three hundred autopsies on American casualties of the Korean War, with an average age of around twenty-two. Shockingly, 77 percent of soldiers already had visible evidence of coronary atherosclerosis. Some even had arteries that were blocked off 90 percent or more.20 The study “dramatically showed that atherosclerotic changes appear in the coronary arteries years and decades before the age at which coronary heart disease (CHD) becomes a clinically recognized problem.”21

Later studies of accidental death victims between the ages of three and twenty-six found that fatty streaks—the first stage of atherosclerosis—were found in nearly all American children by age ten.22 By the time we reach our twenties and thirties, these fatty streaks can turn into full-blown plaques like those seen in the young American GIs of the Korean War. And by the time we’re forty or fifty, they can start killing us off.

If there’s anyone reading this over the age of ten, the question isn’t whether or not you want to eat healthier to prevent heart disease but whether or not you want to reverse the heart disease you very likely already have.

Just how early do these fatty streaks start to appear? Atherosclerosis may start even before birth. Italian researchers looked inside arteries taken from miscarriages and premature newborns who died shortly after birth. It turns out that the arteries of fetuses whose mothers had high LDL cholesterol levels were more likely to contain arterial lesions.23 This finding suggests that atherosclerosis may not just start as a nutritional disease of childhood but one during pregnancy.

It’s become commonplace for pregnant women to avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. It’s also never too early to start eating healthier for the next generation.

**********************************************************
According to William C. Roberts, the editor in chief of the American Journal of Cardiology, the only critical risk factor for atherosclerotic plaque buildup is cholesterol, specifically elevated LDL cholesterol in your blood.24 Indeed, LDL is called “bad” cholesterol, because it’s the vehicle by which cholesterol is deposited into your arteries. Autopsies of thousands of young accident victims have shown that the level of cholesterol in the blood was closely correlated with the amount of atherosclerosis in their arteries.25 To drastically reduce LDL cholesterol levels, you need to drastically reduce your intake of three things: trans fat, which comes from processed foods and naturally from meat and dairy; saturated fat, found mainly in animal products and junk foods; and to a lesser extent dietary cholesterol, found exclusively in animal-derived foods, especially eggs.26

Notice a pattern here? The three boosters of bad cholesterol—the number-one risk factor for our number-one killer—all stem from eating animal products and processed junk. This likely explains why populations living on traditional diets revolving around whole plant foods have largely remained free from the epidemic of heart disease.


//*************************
The optimal LDL cholesterol level is probably 50 or 70 mg/dL, and apparently, the lower, the better. That’s where you start out at birth, that’s the level seen in populations largely free of heart disease, and that’s the level at which the progression of atherosclerosis appears to stop in cholesterol-lowering trials.28 An LDL around 70 mg/dL corresponds to a total cholesterol reading of about 150, the level below which no deaths from coronary heart disease were reported in the famous Framingham Heart Study, a generations-long project to identify risk factors for heart disease.29 The population target should therefore be a total cholesterol level under 150 mg/dL. “If such a goal was created,” Dr. Roberts wrote, “the great scourge of the Western world would be essentially eliminated.”30

The average cholesterol for people living in the United States is much higher than 150 mg/dL; it hovers around 200 mg/dL. If your blood test results came back with a total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, your physician might reassure you that your cholesterol is normal. But in a society where it’s normal to die of heart disease, having a “normal” cholesterol level is probably not a good thing.

To become virtually heart-attack proof, you need to get your LDL cholesterol at least under 70 mg/dL. Dr. Roberts noted that there are only two ways to achieve this for our population: to put more than a hundred million Americans on a lifetime of medications or to recommend they all eat a diet centered around whole plant foods.31

So: drugs or diet. All health plans cover cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, so why change your diet if you can simply pop a pill every day for the rest of your life? Unfortunately, as we’ll see in chapter 15, these drugs don’t work nearly as well as people think, and they may cause undesirable side effects to boot.

//
The cholesterol-lowering statin drug Lipitor has become the best-selling drug of all time, generating more than $140 billion in global sales.32 This class of drugs garnered so much enthusiasm in the medical community that some U.S. health authorities reportedly advocated they be added to the public water supply like fluoride is.33 One cardiology journal even offered the tongue-in-cheek suggestion for fast-food restaurants to offer “McStatin” condiments along with ketchup packets to help neutralize the effects of unhealthy dietary choices.34

For those at high risk for heart disease who are unwilling or unable to bring down their cholesterol levels naturally with dietary changes, the benefits of statins generally outweigh the risks. These drugs do have side effects, though, such as the potential for liver or muscle damage. The reason some doctors routinely order regular blood tests for patients on these drugs is to monitor for liver toxicity. We can also test the blood for the presence of muscle breakdown products, but biopsies reveal that people on statins can show evidence of muscle damage even if their blood work is normal and they exhibit no symptoms of muscle soreness or weakness.35 The decline in muscular strength and performance sometimes associated with these drugs may not be such a big deal for younger individuals, but they can place our seniors at increased risk for falls and injury.36

More recently, other concerns have been raised. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced newly mandated safety labeling on statin drugs to warn doctors and patients about their potential for brain-related side effects, such as memory loss and confusion. Statin drugs also appeared to increase the risk of developing diabetes.37 In 2013, a study of several thousand breast cancer patients reported that long-term use of statins may as much as double a woman’s risk of invasive breast cancer.38 The primary killer of women is heart disease, not cancer, so the benefits of statins may still outweigh the risks, but why accept any risk at all if you can lower your cholesterol naturally?

Plant-based diets have been shown to lower cholesterol just as effectively as first-line statin drugs, but without the risks.39 In fact, the “side effects” of healthy eating tend to be good—less cancer and diabetes risk and protection of the liver and brain, as we’ll explore throughout the rest of this book.


//
Heart Disease Is Reversible

It’s never too early to start eating healthfully, but is it ever too late? Such lifestyle medicine pioneers as Nathan Pritikin, Dean Ornish, and Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. took patients with advanced heart disease and put them on the kind of plant-based diet followed by Asian and African populations who didn’t suffer from heart disease. Their hope was that a healthy enough diet would stop the disease process and keep it from progressing further.

But instead, something miraculous happened.

Their patients’ heart disease started to reverse. These patients were getting better. As soon as they stopped eating an artery-clogging diet, their bodies were able to start dissolving away some of the plaque that had built up. Arteries opened up without drugs or surgery, even in some cases of patients with severe triple-vessel heart disease. This suggests their bodies wanted to heal all along but were just never given the chance.40

Let me share with you what has been called the “best kept secret in medicine”:41 Given the right conditions, the body heals itself. If you whack your shin really hard on a coffee table, it can get red, swollen, and painful. But your shin will heal naturally if you just stand back and let your body work its magic. But what if you kept whacking it in the same place three times a day—say, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner? It would never heal.

You could go to your doctor and complain that your shin hurts. “No problem,” he or she might say, whipping out a pad to write you a prescription for painkillers. You’d go back home, still whacking your shin three times a day, but the pain pills would make it feel so much better. Thank heavens for modern medicine! That’s what happens when people take nitroglycerin for chest pain. Medicine can offer tremendous relief, but it’s not doing anything to treat the underlying cause.

Your body wants to regain its health if you let it. But if you keep reinjuring yourself three times a day, you interrupt the healing process. Consider smoking and lung cancer risk: One of the most amazing things I learned in medical school was that within about fifteen years of stopping smoking, your lung-cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong nonsmoker.42 Your lungs can clear out all that tar buildup and, eventually, it’s almost as if you never smoked at all.

Your body wants to be healthy. And every night of your smoking life, as you fall asleep, that healing process is restarted until … bam!—you light up your first cigarette the next morning. Just as you can reinjure your lungs with every puff, you can reinjure your arteries with every bite. You can choose moderation and hit yourself with a smaller hammer, but why beat yourself up at all? You can choose to stop damaging yourself, get out of your own way, and let your body’s natural healing process bring you back toward health.


//************************************************
Endotoxins Crippling Your Arteries

Unhealthy diets don’t just affect the structure of your arteries; an unhealthy diet can also affect their functioning. Your arteries are not merely inert pipes through which blood flows. They are dynamic, living organs. We’ve known for nearly two decades that a single fast-food meal—Sausage and Egg McMuffins were used in the original study—can stiffen your arteries within hours, cutting in half their ability to relax normally.43 And just as this inflammatory state starts to calm down five or six hours later—lunchtime! You may once again whack your arteries with another load of harmful food, leaving many Americans stuck in a danger zone of chronic, low-grade inflammation. Unhealthy meals don’t just cause internal damage decades down the road but right here and now, within hours of going into your mouth.

Originally, researchers blamed the animal fat or animal protein, but attention has recently shifted to bacterial toxins known as “endotoxins.” Certain foods, such as meats, appear to harbor bacteria that can trigger inflammation dead or alive, even when the food is fully cooked. Endotoxins are not destroyed by cooking temperatures, stomach acid, or digestive enzymes, so after a meal of animal products, these endotoxins may end up in your intestines. They are then thought to be ferried by saturated fat across the gut wall into your bloodstream, where they can trigger the inflammatory reaction in your arteries.44

This may help explain the remarkable speed at which cardiac patients can experience relief when placed on a diet composed primarily of plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Dr. Ornish reported a 91 percent reduction in angina attacks within just a few weeks in patients placed on a plant-based diet both with45 or without46 exercise. This rapid resolution in chest pain occurred well before their bodies could have cleared the plaque from their arteries, suggesting plant-based diets don’t just help clean out arteries but also improve their day-to-day function. In contrast, control-group patients who were instead told to follow the advice of their doctors had a 186 percent increase in angina attacks.47 It’s no surprise their conditions worsened, given that they continued to eat the same diet that crippled their arteries in the first place.

We’ve known about the dramatic power of dietary changes for decades. For example, there was a paper entitled “Angina and Vegan Diet” published in the American Heart Journal back in 1977. Vegan diets are exclusively plant based, avoiding meat, dairy, and eggs. Doctors described cases like that of Mr. F. W. (initials are often used to protect patient confidentiality), a sixty-five-year-old man with angina so severe he had to stop every nine or ten steps. He couldn’t even make it to the mailbox. He was started on a vegan diet, and his pain improved within days. Within months, he was reportedly climbing mountains with no pain at all.48

Not ready to start eating healthier? Well, there is a new class of antiangina drugs, such as ranolazine (sold as Ranexa). A drug company executive suggested its product be used for people not “able to comply with the substantial dietary changes required to achieve a vegan diet.”49 The medication costs more than $2,000 a year, but the side effects are relatively minor, and it does work … technically speaking. At the highest dose, Ranexa was able to prolong exercise duration by 33.5 seconds.50 More than half a minute! It doesn’t look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon.

Research showing that coronary heart disease can be reversed with a plant-based diet—with or without other healthy lifestyle changes—has been published for decades in some of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Why hasn’t this news translated into public policy yet?

 

CHAPTER 1

How Not to Die from Heart Disease

Imagine if terrorists created a bioagent that spread mercilessly, claiming the lives of nearly four hundred thousand Americans every year. That is the equivalent of one person every eighty-three seconds, every hour, around the clock, year after year. The pandemic would be front-page news all day, every day. We’d marshal the army and march our finest medical minds into a room to figure out a cure for this bioterror plague. In short, we’d stop at nothing until the terrorists were stopped.

Fortunately, we’re not actually losing hundreds of thousands of people each year to a preventable threat … are we?

Actually, we are. This particular biological weapon may not be a germ released by terrorists, but it kills more Americans annually than have all our past wars combined. It can be stopped not in a laboratory but right in our grocery stores, kitchens, and dining rooms. As far as weapons go, we don’t need vaccines or antibiotics. A simple fork will do.

So what’s going on here? If this epidemic is present on such a massive scale, yet so preventable, why aren’t we doing more about it?

The killer I’m talking about is coronary heart disease, and it’s affecting nearly everyone raised on the standard American diet.

Our Top Killer

America’s number-one killer is a different kind of terrorist: fatty deposits in the walls of your arteries called atherosclerotic plaque. For most Americans raised on a conventional diet, plaque accumulates inside the coronary arteries—the blood vessels that crown the heart (hence “coronary”) and supply it with oxygen-rich blood. This buildup of plaque, known as atherosclerosis, from the Greek words athere (gruel) and sklerosis (hardening), is the hardening of the arteries by pockets of cholesterol-rich gunk that builds up within the inner linings of the blood vessels. This process occurs over decades, slowly bulging into the space inside the arteries, narrowing the path for blood to flow. The restriction of blood circulation to the heart muscle can lead to chest pain and pressure, known as angina, when people try to exert themselves. If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form within the artery. This sudden blockage of blood flow can cause a heart attack, damaging or even killing part of the heart.

When you think about heart disease, you may think of friends or loved ones who suffered for years with chest pain and shortness of breath before they finally succumbed. However, for the majority of Americans who die suddenly from heart disease, the very first symptom may be their last.1 It’s called “sudden cardiac death.” This is when death occurs within an hour of symptom onset. In other words, you may not even realize you’re at risk until it’s too late. You could be feeling perfectly fine one moment, and then an hour later, you’re gone forever. That’s why it’s critical to prevent heart disease in the first place, before you even necessarily know you have it.

My patients often asked me, “Isn’t heart disease just a consequence of getting old?” I can see why this is a common misconception. After all, your heart pumps literally billions of times during the average life span. Does your ticker just conk out after a while? No.

A large body of evidence shows there were once enormous swaths of the world where the epidemic of coronary heart disease simply didn’t exist. For instance, in the famous China-Cornell-Oxford Project (known as the China Study), researchers investigated the eating habits and incidence of chronic disease among hundreds of thousands of rural Chinese. In Guizhou province, for example, a region comprising half a million people, over the course of three years, not a single death could be attributed to coronary artery disease among men under sixty-five.2

During the 1930s and 1940s, Western-trained doctors working throughout an extensive network of missionary hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa noticed that many of the chronic diseases laying waste to populations in the so-called developed world were largely absent across most of the continent. In Uganda, a country of millions in eastern Africa, coronary heart disease was described as “almost non-existent.”3

But were the people of these nations simply dying early of other diseases, never living long enough to come down with heart disease? No. The doctors compared autopsies of Ugandans to autopsies of Americans who had died at the same age. The researchers found that out of 632 people autopsied in Saint Louis, Missouri, there had been 136 heart attacks. But in 632 age-matched Ugandans? A single heart attack. The Ugandans experienced more than one hundred times fewer heart attacks than the Americans. The doctors were so blown away that they examined another 800 deaths in Uganda. Out of more than 1,400 Ugandans autopsied, researchers found just one body with a small, healed lesion of the heart, meaning the attack wasn’t even fatal. Then and now, in the industrialized world, heart disease is a leading killer. In central Africa, heart disease was so rare it killed fewer than one in a thousand.4

Immigration studies show that this resistance to heart disease is not just something in the Africans’ genes. When people move from low-risk to high-risk areas, their disease rates skyrocket as they adopt the diet and lifestyle habits of their new homes.5 The extraordinarily low rates of heart disease in rural China and Africa have been attributed to the extraordinarily low cholesterol levels among these populations. Though Chinese and African diets are very different, they share commonalities: They are both centered on plant-derived foods, such as grains and vegetables. By eating so much fiber and so little animal fat, their total cholesterol levels averaged under 150 mg/dL,6,7 similar to people who eat contemporary plant-based diets.8

So what does all of this mean? It means heart disease may be a choice.

If you looked at the teeth of people who lived more than ten thousand years before the invention of the toothbrush, you’d notice they had almost no cavities.9 They never flossed a day in their lives, yet no cavities. That’s because candy bars hadn’t been invented yet. The reason people get cavities now is that the pleasure they derive from sugary treats may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist’s chair. I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence—I’ve got a good dental plan! But what if instead of the dental plaque on our teeth, we’re talking about the atherosclerotic plaque building up in our arteries? We’re not just talking about scraping tartar anymore. We’re talking about life and death.

Heart disease is the number-one reason we and most of our loved ones will die. Of course, it’s up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live, but shouldn’t we try to make these choices consciously by educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions? Just as we could avoid sugary foods that rot our teeth, we can avoid the trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol-laden foods that clog up our arteries.

Let’s take a look at the progression of coronary heart disease throughout life and learn how simple dietary choices at any stage may prevent, stop, and even reverse heart disease before it’s too late.

Is Fish Oil Just Snake Oil?

Thanks in part to the American Heart Association’s recommendation that individuals at high risk for heart disease should ask their physicians about omega-3 fish oil supplementation,10 fish oil pills have grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. We now consume more than one hundred thousand tons of fish oil every year.11

But what does the science say? Are the purported benefits of fish oil supplementation for the prevention and treatment of heart disease just a fish tale? A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at all the best randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of omega-3 fats on life span, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke. These included studies not only on fish oil supplements but also studies on the effects of advising people to eat more oily fish. What did they find? Overall, the researchers found no protective benefit for overall mortality, heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death, heart attack, or stroke.12

What about for someone who had already had a heart attack and is trying to prevent another? Still no benefit was found.13

Where did we even get this idea that the omega-3 fats in fish and fish oil supplements are good for you? There was a notion that Eskimos were protected from heart disease, but that appears to be a complete myth.14 Some early studies, however, looked promising. For example, the famous DART trial from the 1980s involving two thousand men found that those advised to eat fatty fish had a 29 percent reduction in mortality.15 That’s impressive, so it’s no wonder the study got a lot of attention. But people seem to have forgotten about the sequel, the DART-2 trial, which found the exact opposite. Run by the same group of researchers, the DART-2 trial was an even bigger study—three thousand men—but this time, participants advised to eat oily fish and particularly those who were supplied with fish oil capsules had a higher risk of cardiac death.16,17

After putting all the studies together, researchers concluded that there was no longer justification for the use of omega-3s in everyday clinical practice.18 What should doctors do when their patients follow the American Heart Association’s advice and inquire about fish oil supplements? As the director of Lipids and Metabolism at Mount Sinai’s cardiovascular institute put it: “Given this and other negative meta-analyses, our job [as doctors] should be to stop highly marketed fish oil supplementation to all our patients…”19

Heart Disease Starts in Childhood

In 1953, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association radically changed our understanding of the development of heart disease. Researchers conducted a series of three hundred autopsies on American casualties of the Korean War, with an average age of around twenty-two. Shockingly, 77 percent of soldiers already had visible evidence of coronary atherosclerosis. Some even had arteries that were blocked off 90 percent or more.20 The study “dramatically showed that atherosclerotic changes appear in the coronary arteries years and decades before the age at which coronary heart disease (CHD) becomes a clinically recognized problem.”21

Later studies of accidental death victims between the ages of three and twenty-six found that fatty streaks—the first stage of atherosclerosis—were found in nearly all American children by age ten.22 By the time we reach our twenties and thirties, these fatty streaks can turn into full-blown plaques like those seen in the young American GIs of the Korean War. And by the time we’re forty or fifty, they can start killing us off.

If there’s anyone reading this over the age of ten, the question isn’t whether or not you want to eat healthier to prevent heart disease but whether or not you want to reverse the heart disease you very likely already have.

Just how early do these fatty streaks start to appear? Atherosclerosis may start even before birth. Italian researchers looked inside arteries taken from miscarriages and premature newborns who died shortly after birth. It turns out that the arteries of fetuses whose mothers had high LDL cholesterol levels were more likely to contain arterial lesions.23 This finding suggests that atherosclerosis may not just start as a nutritional disease of childhood but one during pregnancy.

It’s become commonplace for pregnant women to avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. It’s also never too early to start eating healthier for the next generation.

According to William C. Roberts, the editor in chief of the American Journal of Cardiology, the only critical risk factor for atherosclerotic plaque buildup is cholesterol, specifically elevated LDL cholesterol in your blood.24 Indeed, LDL is called “bad” cholesterol, because it’s the vehicle by which cholesterol is deposited into your arteries. Autopsies of thousands of young accident victims have shown that the level of cholesterol in the blood was closely correlated with the amount of atherosclerosis in their arteries.25 To drastically reduce LDL cholesterol levels, you need to drastically reduce your intake of three things: trans fat, which comes from processed foods and naturally from meat and dairy; saturated fat, found mainly in animal products and junk foods; and to a lesser extent dietary cholesterol, found exclusively in animal-derived foods, especially eggs.26

Notice a pattern here? The three boosters of bad cholesterol—the number-one risk factor for our number-one killer—all stem from eating animal products and processed junk. This likely explains why populations living on traditional diets revolving around whole plant foods have largely remained free from the epidemic of heart disease.

It’s the Cholesterol, Stupid!

Dr. Roberts hasn’t only been editor in chief of the American Journal of Cardiology for more than thirty years; he’s the executive director of the Baylor Heart and Vascular Institute and has authored more than a thousand scientific publications and written more than a dozen textbooks on cardiology. He knows his stuff.

In his editorial “It’s the Cholesterol, Stupid!,” Dr. Roberts argued (as noted earlier) that there is only one true risk factor for coronary heart disease: cholesterol.27 You could be an obese, diabetic, smoking couch potato and still not develop atherosclerosis, he argues, as long as the cholesterol level in your blood is low enough.

The optimal LDL cholesterol level is probably 50 or 70 mg/dL, and apparently, the lower, the better. That’s where you start out at birth, that’s the level seen in populations largely free of heart disease, and that’s the level at which the progression of atherosclerosis appears to stop in cholesterol-lowering trials.28 An LDL around 70 mg/dL corresponds to a total cholesterol reading of about 150, the level below which no deaths from coronary heart disease were reported in the famous Framingham Heart Study, a generations-long project to identify risk factors for heart disease.29 The population target should therefore be a total cholesterol level under 150 mg/dL. “If such a goal was created,” Dr. Roberts wrote, “the great scourge of the Western world would be essentially eliminated.”30

The average cholesterol for people living in the United States is much higher than 150 mg/dL; it hovers around 200 mg/dL. If your blood test results came back with a total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, your physician might reassure you that your cholesterol is normal. But in a society where it’s normal to die of heart disease, having a “normal” cholesterol level is probably not a good thing.

To become virtually heart-attack proof, you need to get your LDL cholesterol at least under 70 mg/dL. Dr. Roberts noted that there are only two ways to achieve this for our population: to put more than a hundred million Americans on a lifetime of medications or to recommend they all eat a diet centered around whole plant foods.31

So: drugs or diet. All health plans cover cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, so why change your diet if you can simply pop a pill every day for the rest of your life? Unfortunately, as we’ll see in chapter 15, these drugs don’t work nearly as well as people think, and they may cause undesirable side effects to boot.

Want Fries with That Lipitor?

The cholesterol-lowering statin drug Lipitor has become the best-selling drug of all time, generating more than $140 billion in global sales.32 This class of drugs garnered so much enthusiasm in the medical community that some U.S. health authorities reportedly advocated they be added to the public water supply like fluoride is.33 One cardiology journal even offered the tongue-in-cheek suggestion for fast-food restaurants to offer “McStatin” condiments along with ketchup packets to help neutralize the effects of unhealthy dietary choices.34

For those at high risk for heart disease who are unwilling or unable to bring down their cholesterol levels naturally with dietary changes, the benefits of statins generally outweigh the risks. These drugs do have side effects, though, such as the potential for liver or muscle damage. The reason some doctors routinely order regular blood tests for patients on these drugs is to monitor for liver toxicity. We can also test the blood for the presence of muscle breakdown products, but biopsies reveal that people on statins can show evidence of muscle damage even if their blood work is normal and they exhibit no symptoms of muscle soreness or weakness.35 The decline in muscular strength and performance sometimes associated with these drugs may not be such a big deal for younger individuals, but they can place our seniors at increased risk for falls and injury.36

More recently, other concerns have been raised. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced newly mandated safety labeling on statin drugs to warn doctors and patients about their potential for brain-related side effects, such as memory loss and confusion. Statin drugs also appeared to increase the risk of developing diabetes.37 In 2013, a study of several thousand breast cancer patients reported that long-term use of statins may as much as double a woman’s risk of invasive breast cancer.38 The primary killer of women is heart disease, not cancer, so the benefits of statins may still outweigh the risks, but why accept any risk at all if you can lower your cholesterol naturally?

Plant-based diets have been shown to lower cholesterol just as effectively as first-line statin drugs, but without the risks.39 In fact, the “side effects” of healthy eating tend to be good—less cancer and diabetes risk and protection of the liver and brain, as we’ll explore throughout the rest of this book.

Heart Disease Is Reversible

It’s never too early to start eating healthfully, but is it ever too late? Such lifestyle medicine pioneers as Nathan Pritikin, Dean Ornish, and Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. took patients with advanced heart disease and put them on the kind of plant-based diet followed by Asian and African populations who didn’t suffer from heart disease. Their hope was that a healthy enough diet would stop the disease process and keep it from progressing further.

But instead, something miraculous happened.

Their patients’ heart disease started to reverse. These patients were getting better. As soon as they stopped eating an artery-clogging diet, their bodies were able to start dissolving away some of the plaque that had built up. Arteries opened up without drugs or surgery, even in some cases of patients with severe triple-vessel heart disease. This suggests their bodies wanted to heal all along but were just never given the chance.40

Let me share with you what has been called the “best kept secret in medicine”:41 Given the right conditions, the body heals itself. If you whack your shin really hard on a coffee table, it can get red, swollen, and painful. But your shin will heal naturally if you just stand back and let your body work its magic. But what if you kept whacking it in the same place three times a day—say, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner? It would never heal.

You could go to your doctor and complain that your shin hurts. “No problem,” he or she might say, whipping out a pad to write you a prescription for painkillers. You’d go back home, still whacking your shin three times a day, but the pain pills would make it feel so much better. Thank heavens for modern medicine! That’s what happens when people take nitroglycerin for chest pain. Medicine can offer tremendous relief, but it’s not doing anything to treat the underlying cause.

Your body wants to regain its health if you let it. But if you keep reinjuring yourself three times a day, you interrupt the healing process. Consider smoking and lung cancer risk: One of the most amazing things I learned in medical school was that within about fifteen years of stopping smoking, your lung-cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong nonsmoker.42 Your lungs can clear out all that tar buildup and, eventually, it’s almost as if you never smoked at all.

Your body wants to be healthy. And every night of your smoking life, as you fall asleep, that healing process is restarted until … bam!—you light up your first cigarette the next morning. Just as you can reinjure your lungs with every puff, you can reinjure your arteries with every bite. You can choose moderation and hit yourself with a smaller hammer, but why beat yourself up at all? You can choose to stop damaging yourself, get out of your own way, and let your body’s natural healing process bring you back toward health.

Endotoxins Crippling Your Arteries

Unhealthy diets don’t just affect the structure of your arteries; an unhealthy diet can also affect their functioning. Your arteries are not merely inert pipes through which blood flows. They are dynamic, living organs. We’ve known for nearly two decades that a single fast-food meal—Sausage and Egg McMuffins were used in the original study—can stiffen your arteries within hours, cutting in half their ability to relax normally.43 And just as this inflammatory state starts to calm down five or six hours later—lunchtime! You may once again whack your arteries with another load of harmful food, leaving many Americans stuck in a danger zone of chronic, low-grade inflammation. Unhealthy meals don’t just cause internal damage decades down the road but right here and now, within hours of going into your mouth.

Originally, researchers blamed the animal fat or animal protein, but attention has recently shifted to bacterial toxins known as “endotoxins.” Certain foods, such as meats, appear to harbor bacteria that can trigger inflammation dead or alive, even when the food is fully cooked. Endotoxins are not destroyed by cooking temperatures, stomach acid, or digestive enzymes, so after a meal of animal products, these endotoxins may end up in your intestines. They are then thought to be ferried by saturated fat across the gut wall into your bloodstream, where they can trigger the inflammatory reaction in your arteries.44

This may help explain the remarkable speed at which cardiac patients can experience relief when placed on a diet composed primarily of plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Dr. Ornish reported a 91 percent reduction in angina attacks within just a few weeks in patients placed on a plant-based diet both with45 or without46 exercise. This rapid resolution in chest pain occurred well before their bodies could have cleared the plaque from their arteries, suggesting plant-based diets don’t just help clean out arteries but also improve their day-to-day function. In contrast, control-group patients who were instead told to follow the advice of their doctors had a 186 percent increase in angina attacks.47 It’s no surprise their conditions worsened, given that they continued to eat the same diet that crippled their arteries in the first place.

We’ve known about the dramatic power of dietary changes for decades. For example, there was a paper entitled “Angina and Vegan Diet” published in the American Heart Journal back in 1977. Vegan diets are exclusively plant based, avoiding meat, dairy, and eggs. Doctors described cases like that of Mr. F. W. (initials are often used to protect patient confidentiality), a sixty-five-year-old man with angina so severe he had to stop every nine or ten steps. He couldn’t even make it to the mailbox. He was started on a vegan diet, and his pain improved within days. Within months, he was reportedly climbing mountains with no pain at all.48

Not ready to start eating healthier? Well, there is a new class of antiangina drugs, such as ranolazine (sold as Ranexa). A drug company executive suggested its product be used for people not “able to comply with the substantial dietary changes required to achieve a vegan diet.”49 The medication costs more than $2,000 a year, but the side effects are relatively minor, and it does work … technically speaking. At the highest dose, Ranexa was able to prolong exercise duration by 33.5 seconds.50 More than half a minute! It doesn’t look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon.

Brazil Nuts for Cholesterol Control?

Can a single serving of Brazil nuts bring down your cholesterol levels faster than statin drugs and keep them down even a month after that single meal?

It was one of the craziest findings I’d ever seen. Researchers from—where else?—Brazil gave ten men and women a single meal containing between one and eight Brazil nuts. Amazingly, compared to the control group who ate no nuts at all, just a single serving of four Brazil nuts almost immediately improved cholesterol levels. LDL—the “bad”—cholesterol levels were a staggering twenty points lower just nine hours after eating the Brazil nuts.51 Even drugs don’t work nearly that fast.52

Here’s the truly insane part: The researchers went back and measured the study participants’ cholesterol thirty days later. Even a month after ingesting a single serving of Brazil nuts, their cholesterol levels stayed down.

Normally, when a study comes out in the medical literature showing some too-good-to-be-true result like this, doctors wait to see the results replicated before they change their clinical practice and begin recommending something new to their patients, particularly when the study is done on only ten subjects, and especially when the findings seem too incredible to believe. But when the intervention is cheap, easy, harmless, and healthy—we’re talking just four Brazil nuts per month—then in my opinion, the burden of proof is somewhat reversed. I think the reasonable default position is to do it until proven otherwise.

More is not better, however. Brazil nuts are so high in the mineral selenium that eating four every day may actually bump you up against the tolerable daily limit for selenium. Nevertheless, this is not something you have to worry about if you’re only eating four Brazil nuts a month.

Follow the Money

Research showing that coronary heart disease can be reversed with a plant-based diet—with or without other healthy lifestyle changes—has been published for decades in some of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Why hasn’t this news translated into public policy yet?

In 1977, the U.S. Senate Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs tried to do just that. Known as the McGovern Committee, they released Dietary Goals for the United States, a report advising Americans to cut down on animal-based foods and increase their consumption of plant-based foods. As a founding member of Harvard University’s nutrition department recalls, “The meat, milk and egg producers were very upset.”53 That’s an understatement. Under industry pressure, not only was the goal to “decrease meat consumption” removed from the report but the entire Senate nutrition committee was disbanded. Several prominent senators reputedly lost their election bids as a result of supporting the report.54

In more recent years, it was uncovered that many members of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee had financial ties to everything from candy bar companies to entities like McDonald’s Council on Healthy Lifestyles and Coca-Cola’s Beverage Institute for Health and Wellness. One committee member even served as “brand girl” for cake-mix maker Duncan Hines and then as the official Crisco “brand girl” before going on to help write the official Dietary Guidelines for Americans.55

As one commentator noted in the Food and Drug Law Journal, historically, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee reports contained:

No discussion at all of the scientific research on the health consequences of eating meat. If the Committee actually discussed this research, it would be unable to justify its recommendation to eat meat, as the research would show that meat increases the risks of chronic diseases, contrary to the purposes of the Guidelines. Thus, by simply ignoring that research, the Committee is able to reach a conclusion that would otherwise look improper.56

What about the medical profession, though? Why haven’t my colleagues fully embraced this research demonstrating the power of good nutrition? Sadly, the history of medicine holds many examples of the medical establishment rejecting sound science when it goes against the prevailing conventional wisdom. There’s even a name for it: the “Tomato Effect.” The term was coined in the Journal of the American Medical Association in reference to the fact that tomatoes were once considered poisonous and were shunned for centuries in North America, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.57

It’s bad enough that most medical schools don’t even require a single course on nutrition,58 but it’s even worse when mainstream medical organizations actively lobby against increased nutrition education for physicians.59 When the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) was called out on their proud new corporate relationship with Coca-Cola to support patient education on healthy eating, an executive vice president of the academy tried to quell protests by explaining that this alliance was not without precedent. After all, they’d had relationships with PepsiCo and McDonald’s for some time.60 Even before that, they had financial ties to cigarette maker Philip Morris.61

This argument didn’t seem to placate the critics, so the AAFP executive quoted them the American Dietetic Association’s policy statement that “[t]here are no good or bad foods, just good or bad diets.” No bad foods? Really? The tobacco industry used to broadcast a similar theme: Smoking per se wasn’t bad, only “excess” smoking.62 Sound familiar? Everything in moderation.

The American Dietetic Association (ADA), which produces a series of nutrition fact sheets with guidelines on maintaining a healthy diet, also has its own corporate ties. Who writes these fact sheets? Food industry sources pay the ADA $20,000 per fact sheet to explicitly take part in the drafting process. So we can learn about eggs from the American Egg Board and about the benefits of chewing gum from the Wrigley Science Institute.63

In 2012, the American Dietetic Association changed its name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics but didn’t appear to change its policies. It continues to take millions of dollars every year from processed junk food, meat, dairy, soda, and candy bar companies. In return, the academy lets them offer official educational seminars to teach dietitians what to say to their clients.64 When you hear the title “registered dietitian,” this is the group they are registered through. Thankfully, a movement within the dietitian community, exemplified by the formation of the organization Dietitians for Professional Integrity, has started to buck this trend.

What about individual doctors, though? Why aren’t all my colleagues telling their patients to lay off the Chick-fil-A? Insufficient time during office visits is a common excuse physicians cite, but the top reason doctors give for not counseling patients with high cholesterol to eat healthier is that they think patients may “fear privations related to dietary advice.”65 In other words, doctors perceive that patients would feel deprived of all the junk they’re eating. Can you imagine a doctor saying, “Yeah, I’d like to tell my patients to stop smoking, but I know how much they love it”?

Neal Barnard, M.D., president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, recently wrote a compelling editorial in the American Medical Association’s journal of ethics, describing how doctors went from being bystanders—or even enablers—of smoking to leading the fight against tobacco. Doctors realized they were more effective at counseling patients to quit smoking if they no longer had tobacco stains on their own fingers.

Today, Dr. Barnard says, “Plant-based diets are the nutritional equivalent of quitting smoking.


//************************* Corporate Propaganda
Those warning labels on cigarette packs are everywhere now, but for a long time, the link between smoking and lung cancer was suppressed by powerful interest groups—much as the relationship between certain foods and other leading killers is suppressed today. For example, in the 1980s, Philip Morris, the nation’s leading cigarette manufacturer, launched the notorious Whitecoat Project. The corporation hired doctors to publish ghostwritten studies purporting to negate links between secondhand smoke and lung disease. These papers cherry-picked various scientific reports to conceal and distort the damning evidence of the dangers of secondhand smoke. This whitewashing, coupled with the tobacco industry’s clever marketing campaigns, including cartoonlike ads, helped hook generations of Americans onto their products.4

If, despite all the evidence and warnings, you’re currently a smoker, the most important step you can take is to stop. Now. Please. The benefits of quitting are immediate. According to the American Cancer Society, just twenty minutes after quitting, your heart rate and blood pressure drop. Within a few weeks, your blood circulation and lung function improve. Within a few months, the sweeper cells that help clean the lungs, remove mucus, and reduce the risk of infection start to regrow. And within a year of quitting, your smoking-related risk of coronary heart disease becomes half that of current smokers.5 As we saw in chapter 1, the human body possesses a miraculous ability to heal itself as long as we don’t keep reinjuring it. Simple dietary changes may help to roll back the damage wrought by the carcinogens in tobacco smoke.


//
Certain compounds in broccoli may have the potential to suppress this metastatic spread. In a 2010 study, scientists laid down a layer of human lung cancer cells in a petri dish and cleared a swath down the middle. Within twenty-four hours, the cancer cells had crept back together, and within thirty hours, the gap had closed completely. But when the scientists dripped some cruciferous-vegetable compounds onto the cancer cells, the cancer creep was stunted.9 Whether or not eating broccoli will help prolong survival in cancer patients has yet to be tested in clinical trials, but the nice thing about healthy dietary interventions is that since they have no downsides, they can be added to whatever other treatments one chooses.

//
Smoking Versus Kale

Researchers have found that kale—that dark-green, leafy vegetable dubbed the “queen of greens”—might help control cholesterol levels. Researchers took thirty men with high cholesterol and had them consume three to four shots of kale juice a day for three months. That’s like eating thirty pounds’ worth of kale, or the amount the average American consumes in about a century. So what happened? Did they turn green and start to photosynthesize?

No. What the kale did do was substantially lower their bad (LDL) cholesterol and boost their good (HDL) cholesterol10 as much as running three hundred miles.11 By the end of the study, the antioxidant activity in the blood of most participants had shot up. But curiously, the antioxidant activity in a minority remained flat. Sure enough, these were the smokers. The free radicals created by the cigarettes were thought to have actively depleted the body of antioxidants. When your smoking habit erases the antioxidant-boosting effects of eight hundred cups of kale, you know it’s time to quit.

Carcinogen-Blocking Effects of Turmeric

The Indian spice turmeric, which gives curry powder its characteristic golden color, may also help prevent some of the DNA damage caused by smoking. Since 1987, the National Cancer Institute has tested more than a thousand different compounds for “chemopreventive” (cancer-preventing) activity. Only a few dozen have made it to clinical trials, but among the most promising is curcumin, the bright-yellow pigment in turmeric.12

Chemopreventive agents can be classified into different subgroups based on which stage of cancer development they help to fight: Carcinogen blockers and antioxidants help prevent the initial triggering DNA mutation, and antiproliferatives work by keeping tumors from growing and spreading. Curcumin is special in that it appears to belong to all three groups, meaning it may potentially help prevent and/or arrest cancer cell growth.13

*************************************************************************8
The anticancer effects of curcumin extend beyond its ability to potentially prevent DNA mutations. It also appears to help regulate programmed cell death. Your cells are preprogrammed to die naturally to make way for fresh cells through a process known as apoptosis (from the Greek ptosis, falling, and apo, away from). In a sense, your body is rebuilding itself every few months with the building materials you provide it through your diet. Some cells, however, overstay their welcome—namely, cancer cells. By somehow disabling their own suicide mechanism, they don’t die when they’re supposed to. Because they continue to thrive and divide, cancer cells can eventually form tumors and potentially spread throughout the body.

So how does curcumin affect this process? It appears to have the ability to reprogram the self-destruct mechanism back into cancer cells. All cells contain so-called death receptors that trigger the self-destruction sequence, but cancer cells can disable their own death receptors. Curcumin, however, appears able to reactivate them.17 Curcumin can also kill cancer cells directly by activating “execution enzymes” called caspases inside cancer cells that destroy them from within by chopping up their proteins.18 Unlike most chemotherapy drugs, against which cancer cells can develop resistance over time, curcumin affects several mechanisms of cell death simultaneously, making it potentially harder for cancer cells to avoid destruction.19

Curcumin has been found to be effective against a variety of other cancer cells in vitro, including those of the breast, brain, blood, colon, kidney, liver, lungs, and skin. For reasons not fully understood, curcumin seems to leave noncancerous cells alone.20 Unfortunately, turmeric has yet to be tested in clinical trials for the prevention or treatment of lung cancer, but with no downsides at culinary doses, I’d suggest trying to find ways to incorporate the spice into your diet. I offer a number of suggestions in part 2

//
Dietary Secondhand Smoke

Though the majority of lung cancer is attributed to smoking, approximately a quarter of all cases occur in people who’ve never smoked.21 Although some of these cases are due to secondhand smoke, another contributing cause may be another potentially carcinogenic plume: fumes from frying.

When fat is heated to frying temperatures, whether it be animal fat, such as lard, or plant fat, such as vegetable oil, toxic volatile chemicals with mutagenic properties (those able to cause genetic mutations) are released into the air.22 This happens even before the “smoke point” temperature is reached.23 If you do fry at home, good ventilation in the kitchen may reduce lung cancer risk.24

Cancer risk may also depend on what’s being fried. A study of women in China found that smokers who stir-fried meat every day had nearly three times the odds of lung cancer compared to smokers who stir-fried foods other than meat on a daily basis.25 This is thought to be because of a group of carcinogens called heterocyclic amines that are formed when muscle tissue is subjected to high temperatures. (We’ll talk more about these in chapter 11.)

The effects of meat fumes can be hard to separate from the effects of eating the meat itself, but a recent study on pregnant women and barbecuing attempted to tease them out. When meat is grilled, 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also produced, one of the probable carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The researchers discovered that not only was the ingestion of grilled meat in the third trimester associated with smaller birth weights, mothers merely exposed to the fumes tended to give birth to babies with a birth weight deficit. Exposure to the fumes was also associated with a smaller head size, an indicator of brain volume.26 Air pollution studies suggest prenatal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may then translate into adverse effects on children’s future cognitive development (as manifested by a significantly lower IQ).27

Even just living next to a restaurant may pose a health hazard. Scientists estimated the lifetime cancer risk among those residing near the exhaust outlets at Chinese restaurants, American restaurants, and barbecue joints. While exposure to fumes from all three types of restaurants resulted in exposure to unsafe levels of PAHs, the Chinese restaurants proved to be the worst. This is thought to be due to the amount of fish being cooked,28 as the fumes from pan-fried fish have been found to contain high levels of PAHs capable of damaging the DNA of human lung cells.29 Given the excess cancer risk, the researchers concluded that it wouldn’t be safe to live near the exhaust of a Chinese restaurant for more than a day or two a month.30

What about that enticing aroma of sizzling bacon? The fumes produced by frying bacon contain a class of carcinogens called nitrosamines.31 Although all meat may release potentially carcinogenic fumes, processed meat like bacon may be the worst: A UC-Davis study found that bacon fumes cause about four times more DNA mutations than the fumes from beef patties fried at similar temperatures.32

What about tempeh bacon? Tempeh is a fermented soybean product used to make a variety of meat substitutes. Researchers compared the DNA-mutating effects of the fumes from frying bacon and beef to tempeh. The bacon and burger fumes were mutagenic, but the tempeh fumes were not. Nevertheless, it’s still not a good idea to eat fried foods. Though no DNA changes were detected after exposure to tempeh smoke, the fried tempeh itself did cause some DNA mutations (though 45 times fewer than the beef and 346 times fewer than the bacon). The researchers proposed that these findings might account for the higher incidence of respiratory diseases and lung cancer among cooks and lower incidence overall among vegetarians.33

If you do need to be around frying bacon or eggs, it would be safer to limit your exposure by using a backyard grill. Studies show that the number of particles deposited into the lungs increases by a factor of ten when frying indoors versus outdoors.

// CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, is a condition that makes it difficult to breathe and gets worse and worse over time. In addition to shortness of breath, COPD can cause severe coughing, excess mucus production, wheezing, and chest tightness. The disease affects more than twenty-four million Americans.35

Smoking is far and away the leading cause of COPD, but other factors can contribute, such as prolonged exposure to air pollution. Unfortunately, there is no cure for COPD, but there is some good news: A healthy diet may help to prevent COPD and help keep it from getting worse.

A twin pair of studies from Columbia and Harvard Universities found that consumption of cured meat—like bacon, bologna, ham, hot dogs, sausage, and salami—may increase the risk of COPD.38,39 It’s thought to be due to the nitrite preservatives in meat, which may mimic the lung-damaging properties of the nitrite by-products of cigarette smoke.

What if you already have the disease? Can the same foods that appear to help prevent COPD be used to treat it? We didn’t know until a landmark study was published in 2010. More than a hundred COPD patients were randomized into two groups—half were instructed to boost their fruit and vegetable consumption, while the others remained on their normal diet. Over the next three years, the standard-diet subjects became progressively worse, as expected. In contrast, the disease progression was halted in the group consuming more fruits and veggies. Not only did their lung function not get worse, it actually improved a little. The researchers suggested this could be due to a combination of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the fruits and vegetables, along with a potential reduction in the consumption of meat, which is thought to act as a pro-oxidant.41

Regardless of the mechanism, a diet with more whole plant foods may help both prevent and arrest the progression of this leading killer.

In general, the prevalence of asthma and respiratory symptoms reportedly appears to be lower among populations eating more foods of plant origin.

Foods of animal origin have been associated with increased asthma risk. A study of more than one hundred thousand adults in India found that those who consumed meat daily, or even occasionally, were significantly more likely to suffer from asthma than those who excluded meat and eggs from their diets altogether.50 Eggs (along with soda) have also been associated with asthma attacks in children, along with respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and exercise-induced coughing.51 Removing eggs and dairy from the diet has been shown to improve asthmatic children’s lung function in as few as eight weeks.52

*******************************************************************
The mechanism by which diet affects airway inflammation may lie with the thin coating of fluid that forms the interface between your respiratory-tract lining and the outside air. Using the antioxidants obtained from the fruits and vegetables you eat, this fluid acts as your first line of defense against the free radicals that contribute to asthmatic airway hypersensitivity, contraction, and mucus production.53 Oxidation by-products can be measured in exhaled breath and are significantly lowered by shifting toward a more plant-based diet.54

So if asthmatics eat fewer fruits and vegetables, does their lung function decline? Researchers out of Australia tried removing fruits and vegetables from asthma patients’ diets to see what would happen. Within two weeks, asthma symptoms grew significantly worse. Interestingly, the low-fruit, low-vegetable diet used in the study—a restriction to no more than one serving of fruit and two servings of vegetables per day—is typical of Western diets. In other words, the diet they used experimentally to impair people’s lung function and worsen their asthma was effectively the standard American diet.

What about improving asthma by adding fruits and vegetables? Researchers repeated the experiment, but this time increased fruit and vegetable consumption to seven servings a day. This simple act of adding a few more fruits and vegetables to their daily diet ended up successfully cutting the study subjects’ exacerbation rate in half.56 That’s the power of eating healthfully.

If it’s the antioxidants, why not just take an antioxidant supplement? After all, popping a pill is easier than eating an apple. The reason is simple: Supplements don’t appear to work. Studies have repeatedly shown that antioxidant supplements have no beneficial effects on respiratory or allergic diseases, underscoring the importance of eating whole foods rather than trying to take isolated components or extracts in pill form.57 For example, the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study found that women who obtained high levels of vitamin E from a nut-rich diet appeared to have nearly half the risk of asthma of those who didn’t, but those who took vitamin E supplements saw no benefit at all.58

Who do you think did better? A group of asthma patients who ate seven servings a day of fruits and vegetables, or a group who ate three servings plus fifteen “serving equivalents” in pill form? Sure enough, the pills didn’t seem to help at all. Improvements in lung function and asthma control were evident only after subjects increased their actual fruit and vegetable intake, strongly suggesting that consuming whole foods is paramount.59

If adding a few daily servings of fruits and vegetables can have such a significant effect, what if asthma sufferers were put on a diet composed entirely of plant foods? Researchers in Sweden decided to test out a strictly plant-based diet on a group of severe asthmatics who weren’t getting better despite the best medical therapies—thirty-five patients with long-established, physician-verified asthma, twenty of whom had been admitted to hospitals for acute attacks during the previous two years. One patient had received emergency intravenous infusions a total of twenty-three times, another reported he’d been hospitalized more than a hundred times, and one subject had even suffered a cardiac arrest after an attack and had to be revived and placed on a ventilator.60 These were some pretty serious cases.

Of the twenty-four patients who stuck with the plant-based diet, 70 percent improved after four months, and 90 percent improved within one year. And these were all people who had experienced no improvement in their conditions at all in the year prior to switching to a plant-based diet.61

Within just one year of eating healthier, all but two patients were able to drop their dose of asthma medication or get off their steroids and other drugs altogether. Objective measures like lung function and physical working capacity improved; meanwhile, subjectively, some patients said their improvement was so considerable that they felt like “they had a new life.”62

*************************************************
There was no control group, so the placebo effect may have accounted for some of the improvement, but the nice thing about a healthier diet is that there are only good side effects. In addition to improvements in their asthma control, the study subjects lost an average of eighteen pounds, and their cholesterol and blood pressures got better. From a risk-benefit standpoint, then, it’s definitely worth giving a plant-based diet a try.

//****************************** brain diseases
In my clinical practice, whenever I’ve felt under too much time pressure to address a patient’s smoking or bad dietary habits, I stop and think back to the hideous death of that man in Boston. No one deserves to die like that. I’d like to think no one has to.

//************************
Later in life, my grandma started to lose her mind. By then, I was in medical school, but my newfound knowledge was useless. She had turned. My previously sweet and stately grandmother? Now she threw things at people. She cursed. Her caretaker showed me the teeth marks on her arm where my once kind, loving grandma had bitten her.

That’s the horror of brain disease. Unlike a problem with your foot or your back or even another vital organ, brain disease can attack your self.

The two most serious brain diseases are stroke, which kills nearly 130,000 Americans each year,1 and Alzheimer’s disease, which kills nearly 85,000.2 Most strokes can be thought of as “brain attacks”—like heart attacks, but the rupturing plaques in your arteries cut off blood flow to parts of the brain rather than to parts of the heart. Alzheimer’s is more like a mind attack.

Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most physically and emotionally burdensome diseases, for both sufferers and caregivers. Unlike stroke, which can kill instantly and without any warning, Alzheimer’s involves a slower, more subtle decline over months or years. Instead of cholesterol-filled plaques in your arteries, plaques made of a substance called amyloid develop in the brain tissue itself, associated with the loss of memory and, eventually, loss of life.

While the pathology of stroke and Alzheimer’s are different, one key factor unites them: Mounting evidence suggests that a healthy diet may help prevent them both.

//*****************************************
Granted, you’d have to eat an extraordinarily healthy diet to attain this level of fiber intake, far beyond what is arbitrarily determined as adequate by most health authorities. Rather than patronizing you with what they think is “achievable” by the masses, though, I wish these authorities would just tell you what the science says and let you make up your own mind.

//
Potassium

Take a plant, any plant, and burn it to ash. Throw that ash in a pot of water, boil it, skim off the ashes, and eventually you’ll be left with a white residue known as potash (“pot ash”). Potash has been used for millennia for making everything from soap and glass to fertilizer and bleach. It wasn’t until 1807 that an English chemist figured out that this “vegetable alkali” contained an undiscovered element, which he called pot-ash-ium—that is, potassium.

I mention this simply to emphasize the primary source of potassium in your diet—namely, plants. Every cell in your body requires potassium to function, and you need to get it from your diet. For much of human history, we ate so many plants that we got upward of 10,000 mg of potassium every day.23 Nowadays, less than 2 percent of Americans even reach the recommended daily intake of 4,700 mg.24

The major reason is simple: We don’t eat enough unprocessed plant foods.25 What does potassium have to do with stroke? A review of all the best studies on the relationship between potassium and our top-two killers, heart disease and stroke, determined that a 1,640 mg increase per day in potassium intake was associated with a 21 percent reduction in stroke risk.26 That isn’t enough to bring the average American’s potassium levels to where they should be, but it’s still enough to substantially reduce the risk of stroke. Imagine how much lower your risk would be if you doubled or tripled your intake of whole plant foods.

Bananas, although they’ve been marketed for their potassium content, aren’t actually particularly rich in the mineral. According to the current U.S. Department of Agriculture database, bananas don’t even make the list of the top-thousand foods with the highest levels of potassium; in fact, they come in at number 1,611, right after Reese’s Pieces.27 You’d have to eat a dozen bananas a day just to get the bare minimum recommended amount of potassium.

What are some of the truly potassium-rich foods? The healthiest common whole-food sources are probably greens, beans, and sweet potatoes.

Citrus

Good news for all you orange lovers: Citrus fruit intake has been associated with reduced stroke risk—even more so than apples.29 Say I can’t compare them? I just did! The key may lie with a citrus phytonutrient called hesperidin, which appears to increase blood flow throughout the body, including the brain. Using a machine known as a doppler fluximeter, scientists can measure blood flow through the skin using a laser beam. If we hook people up to this machine and give them a solution containing the amount of hesperidin found in two cups of orange juice, blood pressure decreases and overall blood flow increases. When subjects drank straight orange juice instead of the hesperidin solution, their blood flow was even better. In other words, the stroke-reducing effects of oranges extend beyond just the hesperidin.30 When it comes to food, the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts.

The positive effects of citrus fruits on blood flow don’t require a machine to measure them. In one study, scientists recruited women who suffered from sensitivity to cold weather due to poor blood flow—women with chronically cold hands, feet, and toes—and placed them in a highly air-conditioned room. The women in the experimental group drank a solution containing actual citrus phytonutrients, while another (control) group drank a placebo (an artificially flavored orange drink). The placebo drinkers got colder and colder. Because of decreased blood flow, the temperature of their fingertips dropped nearly 9 degrees Fahrenheit during the course of the study. The fingertips of the women who drank real citrus, meanwhile, cooled less than half as fast, because their blood flow remained steadier. (The researchers also had both groups of women plunge their hands into icy water and saw the citrus drinkers recover about 50 percent faster than the control group.)31

So eating a few oranges before snowboarding may help keep your fingers and toes from getting as chilly. But while warm digits are nice, the reduced stroke risk associated with higher citrus intake is even nicer.

//
Optimal Sleep Duration and Stroke

Lack of sleep, or even too much of it, is associated with increased stroke risk.32 But how much sleep may be too little? How much too much?

Scientists in Japan were the first to take a major stab at this question. They followed nearly 100,000 middle-aged men and women for fourteen years. Compared with people who slept an average of seven hours per night, subjects who got four hours of sleep or less, or ten hours or more, had roughly a 50 percent greater likelihood of dying from a stroke.33

A recent study of 150,000 Americans was able to examine the issue more thoroughly. Higher stroke rates were found among individuals sleeping six hours or less, or nine hours or more. Those at lowest risk got around seven or eight hours of sleep a night.34 Large studies in Europe,35 China,36 and elsewhere37 have confirmed that seven or eight hours appears to be associated with the lowest risk. We’re not sure if the relationship is cause and effect, but until we know more, why not aim for that range? Sleep well!

//************************************************************************************************
Antioxidants and Stroke

Awarded the National Medal of Science, the highest honor for scientific achievement in this country, revered biochemist Earl Stadtman was quoted as saying, “Aging is a disease. The human lifespan simply reflects the level of free radical damage that accumulates in cells. When enough damage accumulates, cells can’t survive properly anymore and they just give up.”38

First proposed in 1972,39 this concept—now called the mitochondrial theory of aging—suggests that free radical damage to your cells’ power source, known as mitochondria, leads to a loss of cellular energy and function over time. This process may be a little like charging your iPod battery over and over—each time, its capacity gets less and less.

But what exactly are free radicals, and what can we do about them?

Here’s my best attempt to simplify the quantum biology of oxidative phosphorylation: Plants get their energy from the sun. You take a plant and place it in the sun, and through a process called photosynthesis, the chlorophyll in the leaves harnesses the sun’s energy and transfers it to tiny building blocks of matter called electrons.

The plant starts out with low-energy electrons and, using the energy of the sun, charges them up into high-energy electrons. In this way, plants store the sun’s energy. When you then eat the plant (or the animals who ate the plant), these electrons (in the form of carbohydrates, protein, and fat) are delivered to all your cells. Then your mitochondria take the plant’s power-packed electrons and use them as an energy source—that is, as fuel—and slowly release their energy. Mind you, this process has to occur in a precise, tightly controlled manner, because these electrons are packed with energy and are therefore volatile, like gasoline.

In fact, gasoline, petroleum, oil, and charcoal aren’t called fossil fuels for nothing. The tanks of our SUVs are filled with mostly prehistoric plant matter that stored the energy of the sun that shone millions of years ago as high-energy electrons.

And just as it would be dangerous to toss a match into a can of gasoline and release all its energy at once, your body has to be cautious. That’s why your cells take these same high-energy electrons from the plants you eat and release their energy in a controlled manner, like a gas stove—just a little at a time until the energy is used up. Your body then passes these used-up electrons to an all-important molecule you may have heard of: oxygen. In fact, the way poisons like cyanide kill you is by preventing your body from giving up these spent electrons to oxygen.

Fortunately, oxygen loves electrons, although maybe a little too much. While your body is taking its sweet time, slowly releasing the electrons’ energy, the oxygen is waiting impatiently at the end of the line. Oxygen would love to get its grubby little hands on one of those high-energy electrons, but your body says, “Hold on. We’ve got to do this slowly, so wait your turn and let it cool off first. We’ll give you your electron, but only after we’ve removed the energy so it’s safe to play with.”

Then the oxygen molecule gets all huffy and exclaims, “I could handle one of them souped-up electrons any day!” Pouting, it spies a stray high-energy electron sitting out in the open. Oxygen looks left, looks right, and then pounces on it. Your body isn’t perfect; it can’t keep an eye on oxygen all the time. About 1–2 percent40 of all high-energy electrons that pass through your cells leak out where oxygen can grab them.

When oxygen gets its hands on a high-energy electron, it basically turns into the Hulk, changing from lowly oxygen into what’s called superoxide, a type of free radical. A free radical is what it sounds like—a molecule that can be unstable, out of control, and violently reactive. The superoxide is just pumped up with energy and can start smashing around the cell, knocking stuff over and tripping over your DNA.

When superoxide comes in contact with DNA, it can damage your genes, which, if not repaired, can cause mutations in your chromosomes that may lead to cancer.41 Thankfully, the body calls in its defense squad, known as antioxidants. They arrive at the scene and say, “Drop that electron!”

The superoxide fights back. “You want a piece of me, Mr. Vitamin C? Bring it!”

So the antioxidants proceed to jump the superoxide and wrestle the supercharged electron away from it, leaving behind poor little oxygen and its ripped jeans.

In scientific circles, the phenomenon by which oxygen molecules grab stray electrons and go crazy is called oxidant, or oxidative, stress. According to the theory, the resulting cellular damage is what essentially causes aging. Aging and disease have been thought of as the oxidation of the body. Those brown age spots on the back of your hands? They’re just oxidized fat under the skin. Oxidant stress is thought to be why we all get wrinkles, why we lose some of our memory, why our organ systems break down as we get older. Basically, the theory goes, we’re rusting.

You can slow down this oxidant process by eating foods containing lots of antioxidants. You can tell whether a food is rich in antioxidants by slicing it open, exposing it to air (oxygen), and then seeing what happens. If it turns brown, it’s oxidizing. Think about our two most popular fruits: apples and bananas. They turn brown quickly, which means there aren’t a lot of antioxidants inside them. (Most of the antioxidants in apples are in the peels.) Cut open a mango and what happens? Nothing happens, because there are lots of antioxidants in there. How do you keep fruit salad from turning brown? By adding lemon juice, which contains the antioxidant vitamin C. Antioxidants can keep your food from oxidizing, and they may do the same inside your body.

One of the diseases antioxidant-rich foods may help prevent is stroke. Swedish researchers followed more than thirty thousand older women over a period of a dozen years and found that those who ate the most antioxidant-rich foods had the lowest stroke risk.42 Similar findings were reported in a younger cohort of men and women in Italy.43 As with lung disease,44 antioxidant supplements don’t appear to help.45 Mother Nature’s powers cannot be stuffed into a pill.

Knowing this, scientists set out to find the most antioxidant-rich foods. Sixteen researchers spanning the globe published a database of the antioxidant power of more than a whopping three thousand foods, beverages, herbs, spices, and supplements. They tested everything from Cap’n Crunch cereal to the crushed dried leaves of the African baobab tree. They tested dozens of brands of beer to see which has the most antioxidants. (Santa Claus beer from Eggenberg, Austria, tied for first place.)46 Sadly, beer represents Americans’ fourth-largest source of dietary antioxidants.47 You can check out the list to see where your favorite foods and beverages rank at this link: http://bit.ly/antioxidantfoods.

No need to post the 138-page chart on your fridge, though. Here’s the simple rule: On average, plant foods contain sixty-four times more antioxidants than animal foods. As the researchers put it, “[A]ntioxidant rich foods originate from the plant kingdom while meat, fish and other foods from the animal kingdom are low in antioxidants.”48 Even the least healthy plant food I can think of, good old American iceberg lettuce (which is 96 percent water!49), contains 17 units (daμmol using a modified FRAP assay) of antioxidant power. Some berries have more than 1,000 units, to give you some perspective, making iceberg look pretty pathetic. But compare iceberg lettuce’s 17 units to fresh salmon, which has only 3 units. Chicken? As few as 5 units of antioxidant power. Skim milk or a hard-boiled egg? Just 4 units, and Egg Beaters has a big old goose egg—0 units. “Diets comprised mainly of animal-based foods are thus low in antioxidant content,” concluded the research team, “while diets based mainly on a variety of plant-based foods are antioxidant rich, due to the thousands of bioactive antioxidant phytochemicals found in plants which are conserved in many foods and beverages.”50

There is no need to necessarily cherry-pick individual foods to boost your antioxidant intake (though cherries do have up to 714!); you can simply strive to include a variety of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices at every meal. This way, you can continuously flood your body with antioxidants to help ward off stroke and other age-related diseases.

//
Antioxidant-rich diets appear to protect against stroke by preventing the circulation of oxidized fats in the bloodstream that can damage the sensitive walls of small blood vessels in the brain.52 They can also help decrease artery stiffness,53 prevent blood clots from forming,54 and lower blood pressure55 and inflammation. 

******************************************************************************************
Free radicals can disfigure proteins in our bodies to the extent they become unrecognizable by our immune systems. The inflammatory response this triggers can be prevented by saturating our bodies with sufficient antioxidants. Whereas all whole plant foods may have anti-inflammatory effects,57 some plants are better than others. High-antioxidant fruits and vegetables, such as berries and greens, have been found to douse systemic inflammation significantly better than the same number of servings of more common low-antioxidant fruits and veggies, such as bananas and lettuce.

The foods we choose make a difference.

// ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
n my clinical practice, the one diagnosis I dreaded giving more than cancer was Alzheimer’s. It wasn’t just because of the psychological toll to come for the patient but because of the emotional toll that would be placed on loved ones. The Alzheimer’s Foundation estimates that fifteen million friends and family members supply more than fifteen billion unpaid hours annually caring for loved ones who may not even recognize them.59

Despite the billions of dollars spent on research, there is still neither a cure nor an effective treatment for the disease, which invariably progresses to death. In short, Alzheimer’s is reaching a state of crisis—emotionally, economically, and even scientifically. Over the past two decades, more than seventy-three thousand research articles have been published on the disease. That’s about a hundred papers a day. Yet very little clinical progress has been made in treating or even understanding it. And a total cure is likely impossible, given that lost cognitive function in Alzheimer’s patients may never be regained due to fatally damaged neuronal networks. Dead nerve cells cannot be brought back to life. Even if drug companies can figure out how to halt the disease’s progression, for many patients, the damage has already been done, and the individual’s personality may be forever lost.60

The good news, as a senior scientist at the Center for Alzheimer’s Research entitled a review article, is that “Alzheimer’s Disease Is Incurable but Preventable.”61 Diet and lifestyle changes could potentially prevent millions of cases a year.62 How? There is an emerging consensus that “what is good for our hearts is also good for our heads,”63 because clogging of the arteries inside of the brain with atherosclerotic plaque is thought to play a pivotal role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.64 It is not surprising, then, that the dietary centerpiece of the 2014 “Dietary and Lifestyle Guidelines for the Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease,” published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging, was: “Vegetables, legumes (beans, peas, and lentils), fruits, and whole grains should replace meats and dairy products as primary staples of the diet.”

// Amyloid plaques
Amyloid plaques are aggregates of misfolded proteins that form in the spaces between nerve cells. These abnormally configured proteins are thought to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid plaques first develop in the areas of the brain concerned with memory and other cognitive functions.

// Is Alzheimer’s a Vascular Disorder?

We generally think of atherosclerosis as a condition of the heart, but it’s been described as “an omnipresent pathology that involves virtually the entire human organism.”68 You have blood vessels in every one of your organs, including your brain. The concept of “cardiogenic dementia,” first proposed in the 1970s, suggested that because the aging brain is highly sensitive to a lack of oxygen, lack of adequate blood flow may lead to cognitive decline.69 Today, we have a substantial body of evidence strongly associating atherosclerotic arteries with Alzheimer’s disease.70

Autopsies have shown repeatedly that Alzheimer’s patients tend to have significantly more atherosclerotic plaque buildup and narrowing of the arteries within the brain.71,72,73 Normal resting cerebral blood flow—the amount of blood circulating to the brain—is typically about a quart per minute. Starting in adulthood, people appear to naturally lose about half a percent of blood flow per year. By age sixty-five, this circulating capacity could be down by as much as 20 percent.74 While such a drop alone may not be sufficient to impair brain function, it can put you close to the edge. The clogging of the arteries inside, and leading to, the brain with cholesterol-filled plaque can drastically reduce the amount of blood—and therefore oxygen—your brain receives. Supporting this theory, autopsies have demonstrated that Alzheimer’s patients had particularly significant arterial blockage in the arteries leading to the memory centers of their brains.

A study of three hundred Alzheimer’s patients found that treating vascular risk factors, such as high cholesterol and blood pressure, may even slow the progression of the disease but not stop it.78 That’s why prevention is the key. Cholesterol doesn’t just help generate atherosclerotic plaques within your brain arteries; it may help seed the amyloid plaques that riddle the brain tissue of Alzheimer’s victims.79 Cholesterol is a vital component of your cells, which is why your body makes all that you need. Consuming excess cholesterol, and especially trans and saturated fats, can raise your blood cholesterol level.80 Too much cholesterol in your blood is not only considered the primary risk factor for heart disease81 but is also unanimously recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.82

Autopsies have revealed that Alzheimer’s brains have significantly more cholesterol buildup than normal brains.83 We used to think that the pool of cholesterol in the brain was separate from the cholesterol circulating in the blood, but there is growing evidence to the contrary.84 Excess cholesterol in the blood can lead to excess cholesterol in the brain, which may then help trigger the clumping of amyloid seen in Alzheimer’s brains. Under an electron microscope, we can see the clustering of amyloid fibers on and around tiny crystals of cholesterol.85 And indeed, advanced brain imaging techniques, such as PET scans, have shown a direct correlation between the amount of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol in the blood and amyloid buildup in the brain.86 Drug companies have hoped to capitalize on this connection to sell cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to prevent Alzheimer’s, but statins themselves can cause cognitive impairment, including short- and long-term memory loss.87 For people unwilling to change their diets, the benefits of statins outweigh the risks,88 but it’s better to lower your cholesterol levels naturally by eating healthier to help preserve your heart, brain, and mind.

What does the ApoE gene do? It makes the protein that’s the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain.100 The E4 variant may lead to an abnormal accumulation of cholesterol within brain cells, which could trigger Alzheimer’s pathology.101 This mechanism may explain the so-called Nigerian paradox. The highest frequency of the ApoE4 variant occurs in Nigerians,102 who surprisingly also have some of the lowest rates of Alzheimer’s.103 Wait a second. The population with the highest rate of the “Alzheimer’s gene” has one of the lowest rates of Alzheimer’s disease? This contradiction may be explained by Nigerians’ extremely low blood-cholesterol levels, thanks to a diet low in animal fat104 and consisting mainly of grains and vegetables.105 So, it seems, diet can trump genetics.

The first human study to show that blueberries improve memory abilities in older adults exhibiting early cognitive deterioration was published in 2010.119 Then, in 2012, Harvard University researchers actually quantified these findings by using data from the Nurses’ Health Study, in which the diets and health of sixteen thousand women were followed starting in 1980. They found that women who consumed at least one serving of blueberries and two servings of strawberries each week had slower rates of cognitive decline—by as much as two and a half years—compared with those who didn’t eat berries. These results suggest that simply eating a handful of berries every day, one easy and delicious dietary tweak, may slow your brain’s aging by more than two years.120

Beyond their antioxidant activity, polyphenols have been shown to protect nerve cells in vitro by inhibiting the formation of the plaques125and tangles126 that characterize Alzheimer’s brain pathology. In theory, they could also “pull out”127 metals that accumulate in certain brain areas and may play a role in the development of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.128 Polyphenols are one of the reasons I make specific recommendations for berries and green tea

Gerontotoxins
AGE
Advanced Glycation Endproducts

Each of us contains tens of billions of miles of DNA—enough for one hundred thousand round trips to the moon if you uncoiled each strand and placed them end to end.134 How do our bodies keep it from all getting tangled up? Enzymes known as sirtuins keep our DNA wrapped up nice and neat around spool-like proteins.

Although they were only discovered recently, sirtuins represent one of the most promising areas of medicine, as they appear to be involved in promoting healthy aging and longevity.135 Autopsy studies show the loss of sirtuin activity is closely associated with the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease—namely, the accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain.

Suppression of this key host defense is considered a central feature of Alzheimer’s.137 The pharmaceutical industry is trying to come up with drugs to increase sirtuin activity, but why not just prevent its suppression in the first place? You may be able to do this by reducing your dietary exposure to advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.138

AGE is an appropriate acronym, as they are considered “gerontotoxins,”meaning aging toxins (from the Greek geros, meaning “old age,” as in “geriatric”). AGEs are thought to accelerate the aging process by cross-linking proteins together, causing tissue stiffness, oxidative stress, and inflammation. This process may play a role in cataract formation and macular degeneration in the eye, as well as damage to the bones, heart, kidneys, and liver.140 They may also impact the brain, appearing to accelerate the slow shrinkage of your brain as you age141 and suppressing your sirtuin defenses.142

Older adults with high levels of AGEs in their blood143 or urine144 appear to suffer an accelerated loss of cognitive function over time. Elevated levels of AGEs are also found in the brains of Alzheimer’s victims.145 Where are these AGEs coming from? Some are produced and detoxified naturally in your body,146 but other than cigarette smoke,147 major sources are “meat and meat-derived products” exposed to dry-heat cooking methods.148 AGEs are formed primarily when fat- and protein-rich foods are exposed to high temperatures.149

More than five hundred foods have been tested for AGE content, everything from Big Macs and Hot Pockets to coffee and Jell-O. In general, meat, cheese, and highly processed foods had the highest AGE content, and grains, beans, breads, vegetables, fruits, and milk had the least.150

The top-twenty most AGE-contaminated products per serving tested were various brands of:

  1. BBQ chicken

  2. Bacon

  3. Broiled hot dog

  4. Roasted chicken thigh

  5. Roasted chicken leg

  6. Pan-fried steak

  7. Oven-fried chicken breast

  8. Deep-fried chicken breast

  9. Stir-fried steak strips

10. McDonald’s Chicken Selects breast strips

11. Pan-fried turkey burger

12. BBQ chicken

13. Oven-fried fish

14. McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets

15. Broiled chicken

16. Pan-fried turkey burger

17. Baked chicken

18. Pan-fried turkey burger

19. Boiled hot dog

20. Broiled steak

You get the idea.

Yes, cooking methods matter. A baked apple has three times more AGEs than a raw apple, and a broiled hot dog has more than a boiled hot dog. But the source is what matters most: a baked apple has 45 units of AGEs compared to a raw apple’s 13 units, while a broiled hot dog has 10,143 units compared to a boiled hot dog’s 6,736. The researchers recommend cooking meat using moist-heat cooking methods, such as steaming or stewing, but even boiled fish has more than 10 times more AGEs than a sweet potato roasted for an hour. Meat averages about 20 times more AGEs than highly processed foods like breakfast cereals and about 150 times more than fresh fruits and vegetables. Poultry was the worst, containing about 20 percent more AGEs than beef. The researchers concluded that even a modest reduction in meat intake could realistically cut daily AGE intake in half.152

Because sirtuin suppression is both preventable and reversible by AGE reduction, avoiding high-AGE foods is seen as potentially offering a new strategy to combat the Alzheimer’s epidemic.

Avoid dry cooking methods, frying, baking(when it comes to veggies a lot of time is steaming in own water, for ex. when baking whole potatoes, they steam in their own water before they actually start baking, by then they are done), roasting, barbecueing  

That's why roasted peanuts and peanut butter is not recommended. Peanuts are legumes. Legumes, nuts and seeds are high in protein and fat. When dry heating is used to cook them they form a lot of AGE.

Halting Cognitive Decline with Exercise?

There is exciting news for people on the verge of losing their mental faculties. In a 2010 study published in the Archives of Neurology, researchers took a group of people with mild cognitive impairment—those who are starting to forget things, for example, or regularly repeating themselves—and had them engage in aerobic exercise for forty-five to sixty minutes a day, four days a week, for six months. The control group was instructed to simply stretch for the same time periods.154

Memory tests were performed before and after the study. Researchers found that in the control (stretching) group, cognitive function continued to decline. But the exercising group not only didn’t get worse, they got better. The exercisers got more test answers correct after six months, indicating their memory had improved.155

Subsequent studies using MRI scans found that aerobic exercise can actually reverse age-related shrinkage in the memory centers of the brain.156 No such effect was found in the stretching and toning control groups or a nonaerobic strength-training group.157 Aerobic exercise can help improve cerebral blood flow, improve memory performance, and help preserve brain tissue.

// How Not to Die from Digestive Cancers

Three of the most common cancers of the digestive tract kill approximately one hundred thousand Americans each year. Colorectal (colon and rectal) cancer, which claims fifty thousand lives annually,5 ranks among the most commonly diagnosed of all cancers. Thankfully, it is also among the most treatable if caught early enough. Pancreatic cancer, on the other hand, is virtually a death sentence for the approximately forty-six thousand people who develop it every year.6 Few survive beyond a year after diagnosis, which means prevention is paramount. Esophageal cancer, which affects the tube between your mouth and stomach, is also frequently fatal for its eighteen thousand annual victims.7 The foods you eat can indirectly affect cancer risk, for example, by exacerbating acid reflux, a risk factor for esophageal cancer, or through direct contact with the lining of the digestive tract.


//COLORECTAL CANCER
In chapter 2, we saw how curcumin, the yellow pigment in the spice turmeric, may be effective against cancer cells in vitro. Very little of the curcumin you eat gets absorbed into your bloodstream, however, so it may never come in sufficient contact with tumors outside the digestive tract.15 But what doesn’t get absorbed into your blood ends up in your colon, where it could impact the cells lining your large intestine where cancerous polyps develop.

The emergence of colorectal cancer can be broken up into three stages. The first sign may be what are called “aberrant crypt foci,” or abnormal clusters of cells along the lining of the colon. Next come polyps that grow from that inner surface. The final stage is thought to occur when a benign polyp transforms into a cancerous one. The cancer can then eat through the wall of the colon and spread throughout the body. To what degree can curcumin block each stage of colorectal cancer?

Studying smokers, who tend to have a lot of aberrant crypt foci, investigators found that curcumin consumption could reduce the number of those cancer-associated structures in their rectums up to nearly 40 percent, from eighteen down to eleven, within just thirty days. The only reported side effect was a yellow tint to their stools.16

What if polyps have already developed? Six months of curcumin, along with another phytonutrient called quercetin, which is found naturally in such fruits and vegetables as red onions and grapes, were found to decrease the number and size of polyps by more than half in patients with a hereditary form of colorectal cancer. Again, virtually no side effects were reported.17

//*******************************************
What if the polyps have already transformed into cancer? In a last-ditch attempt to save the lives of fifteen patients with advanced colorectal cancer who didn’t respond to any of the standard chemotherapy agents or radiation, oncologists started them on a turmeric extract. In the two to four months of treatment, it appeared to help stall the disease in one-third of the patients, five out of fifteen.18

If we were talking about some new kind of chemotherapy drug that only helped one in three people, you’d have to weigh that against all the serious side effects. But when it’s just some plant extract shown to be remarkably safe, even if it just helped one in a hundred, it would be worth considering. With no serious downsides, a one-in-three potential benefit for end-stage cancer seems like it would spark further research, right? But who’s going to pay for a study of something that can’t be patented?19

The low cancer rate in India may be due in part to the spices they use, but it may also stem from the types of foods they are putting those spices on. India is one of the world’s largest producers of fruits and vegetables, and only about 7 percent of the adult population eats meat on a daily basis. What most of the population does eat every day are dark-green, leafy vegetables and legumes,20 such as beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils, which are packed with another class of cancer-fighting compounds called phytates.

//********************************** Constipation ************************
Stool Size Matters

The bigger and more frequent your bowel movements are, the healthier you may be. Based on a study of twenty-three populations across a dozen countries, the incidence of colon cancer appears to skyrocket as the average daily stool weight drops below about a half a pound. Populations dropping quarter pounders appear to have three times the rate of colon cancer. You can measure the weight of your stools with a simple bathroom scale. No, not that way—by weighing yourself before and after you “go.”

The link between stool size and colon cancer may be related to “intestinal transit time,” the number of hours it takes for food to travel from mouth to toilet. The larger the stool, the quicker the transit time, as it’s easier for your intestines to move things along.21 People don’t realize you can have daily bowel movements and still effectively be constipated; what you’re flushing today you may have eaten last week.

How long it takes food to get from one end to the other can depend on gender and dietary habits. Food goes through men eating plant-based diets in just a day or two, but this transit time takes as long as five or more days among those eating more conventional diets. Women eating plant-based diets also average a day or two, but the average intestinal transit time in most women eating conventional diets may be four days.22 So you can be regular but four days late. You can measure your own oral-anal transit time by eating some beets and noting when your stools turn pink. If that takes less than twenty-four to thirty-six hours, you’re probably meeting the healthy half-pound target.23

Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal complaint in the United States, leading to millions of doctor visits each year.24 But beyond just the discomfort, the straining associated with trying to pass small, firm stools may play a role in a host of health problems, including hiatal hernia, varicose veins, hemorrhoids,25 and painful conditions with names like anal fissure.26

Constipation can be considered a nutrient-deficiency disease, and that nutrient is fiber.27 Just as you can get scurvy if you don’t get enough vitamin C, you can get constipation if you don’t get enough fiber. Since fiber is found only in plant foods, it’s no surprise that the more plants you eat, the less likely you are to be constipated. For example, a study comparing thousands of omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans found that those eating strictly plant-based diets are three times more likely to have daily bowel movements.28 Looks like vegans are just regular people.

//***********************************************************************
Phytates

Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States,29 yet in some parts of the world, it’s practically unheard of. The highest rates have been recorded in Connecticut, and the lowest in Kampala, Uganda.30 Why is colorectal cancer so much more prevalent in Western cultures? Seeking answers to this question, renowned surgeon Denis Burkitt spent twenty-four years in Uganda. Many of the Ugandan hospitals Dr. Burkitt visited had never even seen a case of colon cancer.31 He eventually came to the conclusion that fiber intake was the key,32 as most Ugandans consumed diets centered around whole plant foods.33

Subsequent research has suggested that dietary prevention of cancer may involve something other than just fiber. For instance, colorectal cancer rates are higher in Denmark than in Finland,34 yet Danes consume slightly more dietary fiber than Finns.35 What other protective compounds might explain the low cancer rates among plant-based populations? Well, fiber isn’t the only thing found in whole plant foods that’s missing from processed and animal-based foods.

The answer might lie in natural compounds called phytates, which are found in the seeds of plants—in other words, in all whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. Phytates have been shown to detoxify excess iron in the body, which otherwise can generate a particularly harmful kind of free radical called hydroxyl radicals.36 The standard American diet may therefore be a double whammy when it comes to colorectal cancer: Meat contains the type of iron (heme) particularly associated with colorectal cancer37 but lacks, as do refined plant foods, the phytates to extinguish these iron-forged free radicals.

For many years, phytates were maligned as inhibitors of mineral absorption, which is why you might have heard advice to roast, sprout, or soak your nuts to get rid of the phytates. In theory, this would allow you to absorb more minerals, such as calcium. This belief stemmed from a series of laboratory experiments on puppies from 1949 that suggested that phytates had a bone-softening, anticalcifying effect,38 as well as from subsequent studies with similar findings on rats.39 But more recently, in light of actual human data, phytates’ image has undergone a complete makeover.40 Those who eat more high-phytate foods actually tend to have a greater bone mineral density,41 less bone loss, and fewer hip fractures.42 Phytates appear to protect bone in a manner similar to that of antiosteoporosis drugs like Fosamax,43 but without the risk of osteonecrosis (bone rot) of the jaw, a rare, potentially disfiguring side effect associated with that class of drugs.44

Phytates may also help protect against colorectal cancer. A six-year study of about thirty thousand Californians found that higher meat consumption was associated with higher risk of colon cancer. Unexpectedly, white meat appeared to be worse. Indeed, those who ate red meat at least once each week had about double the risk of developing colon cancer; that risk appeared to triple, however, for those who ate chicken or fish once or more a week.45 Eating beans, an excellent source of phytates, was found to help mediate some of that risk, so your colon cancer risk may be determined by your meat-to-vegetable ratio.

There may be as much as an eightfold difference in colorectal cancer risk between the two extremes—high-vegetable, low-meat diets and low-vegetable, high-meat diets.46 So it may not be enough to just cut down on how much meat is in your diet; you also need to eat more plants. The National Cancer Institute’s Polyp Prevention Trial found that those who increased their bean consumption by even less than one-quarter cup a day appeared to cut their odds of precancerous colorectal polyp recurrence by up to 65 percent.47

Of all the wonderful nutrients in beans, why do we credit the phytates with reduced risk? Petri-dish studies have shown that phytates inhibit the growth of virtually all human cancer cells tested so far—including cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, liver, pancreas, and skin48—while leaving normal cells alone.49 This is the mark of a good anticancer agent, the ability to discriminate between tumor cells and normal tissue. When you eat whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, phytates are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and readily taken up by tumor cells. Tumors concentrate these compounds so efficiently that phytate scans can be used to trace the spread of cancer within the body.50

Phytates target cancer cells through a combination of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-enhancing activities. Besides affecting the cancer cells directly, phytates have been found to boost the activity of natural killer cells, which are white blood cells that form your first line of defense by hunting down and disposing of cancer cells.51 Phytates can also play a role in your last line of defense, which involves starving tumors of their blood supply. There are many phytonutrients in plant foods that can help block the formation of new blood vessels that feed tumors, but phytates also appear able to disrupt existing tumor supply lines.52 Similarly, many plant compounds appear able to help slow down and even stop cancer cell growth,53 but phytates can sometimes also cause cancer cells to apparently revert back to their normal state—in other words, to stop behaving like cancer. This cancer cell “rehabilitation” has been demonstrated in vitro in colon cancer cells,54 as well as in cancer cells of the breast,55 liver,56 and prostate.57

Phytates do have side effects, but they all appear to be good. High phytate intake has been associated with less heart disease, less diabetes, and fewer kidney stones. In fact, some researchers have suggested that phytates be considered an essential nutrient. Like vitamins, phytates participate in important biochemical reactions in the body. Your levels fluctuate with dietary intake, and insufficient consumption is associated with diseases that can be moderated by eating adequate amounts. Maybe phytates should be considered “Vitamin P.

//
Reversing Rectal Polyps with Berries?

There are many ways the healthfulness of different fruits and vegetables can be compared, such as by nutrient content or antioxidant activity. Ideally, we would use a measure involving actual biological activity. One way to do this is by measuring the suppression of cancer cell growth. Eleven common fruits were tested by dripping their extracts on cancer cells growing in a petri dish. The result? Berries came out on top.59 Organically grown berries in particular may suppress cancer cell growth better than those grown conventionally.60 But a laboratory is different from real life. These findings are only applicable if the active components of the food are absorbed into your system and manage to find their way to budding tumors. Colorectal cancer, however, grows out of the inner lining of your intestines, so what you eat may have a direct effect regardless. So researchers decided to give berries a try.

Familial adenomatous polyposis is an inherited form of colorectal cancer caused by a mutation in your tumor-suppression genes. People who are affected develop hundreds of polyps in their colons, some of which inevitably turn cancerous. Treatment can involve prophylactic colectomy, where the colon is removed early in life as a preventive step. There was a drug that appeared able to cause polyps to regress, but it was pulled from the market after it killed tens of thousands of people.61 Could berries also cause polyps to retreat without the fatal side effects? Yes. After nine months of daily treatment with black raspberries, the polyp burden of fourteen patients with familial adenomatous polyposis was cut in half.62

Normally, polyps would have to be surgically removed, but the berries seemed to have made them disappear naturally. The method by which the berries were administered, though, was anything but natural. The researchers used a shortcut, giving the berries as suppositories. Don’t try this at home! After they inserted the equivalent of eight pounds of raspberries into patients’ rectums over those nine months, some of the patients suffered from torn anuses.63 The hope is that research will one day show similar cancer-fighting effects of berries taken the old-fashioned way—through the mouth.

//
Too Much Iron?

In 2012, the results from two major Harvard University studies were published. The first, known as the Nurses’ Health Study, began following the diets of about 120,000 women aged thirty to fifty-five starting back in 1976; the second, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed about 50,000 men aged forty to seventy-five. Every four years, researchers checked in with the study participants to keep track of their diets. By 2008, a total of about 24,000 subjects had died, including approximately 6,000 from heart disease and 9,000 from cancer.64

After the results were analyzed, the researchers found that the consumption of both processed and unprocessed red meat was associated with an increased risk of dying from cancer and heart disease and shortened life spans overall. They reached this conclusion even after controlling for (factoring in) age, weight, alcohol consumption, exercise, smoking, family history, caloric intake, and even the intake of whole plant foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. In other words, the study subjects apparently weren’t dying early because they ate less of some beneficial compound like phytates in plants. The findings suggest there may be something harmful in the meat itself.

Imagine the logistics of following more than 100,000 people for decades. Now imagine a study five times that size. The largest study of diet and health in history is the NIH-AARP study, cosponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the American Association of Retired Persons. Over the course of a decade, researchers followed about 545,000 men and women aged fifty to seventy-one in the largest study of meat and 
mortality ever conducted. The scientists came to the same conclusion as the Harvard researchers: Meat consumption was associated with increased risk of dying from cancer, dying from heart disease, and dying prematurely in general. Again, this was after controlling for other diet and lifestyle factors, effectively excluding the possibility that people who ate meat also smoked more, exercised less, or failed to eat their fruits and veggies.65 The accompanying editorial in the American Medical Association’s Archives of Internal Medicine (titled “Reducing Meat Consumption Has Multiple Benefits for the World’s Health”) called for a “major reduction in total meat intake.”66

*************************************** Heme iron*************************
What does meat contain that may raise the risk of premature death? One of the possibilities is heme iron, the form of iron found predominantly in blood and muscle. Because iron can generate cancer-causing free radicals by acting as a pro-oxidant,67 iron can be considered a double-edged sword—too little of it and you risk anemia, too much and you may increase risk of cancer and heart disease.

The human body has no specific mechanism to rid itself of excess iron.68 Instead, humans have evolved to tightly regulate the amount of iron absorbed. If you don’t have enough iron circulating in your body, your intestines begin boosting iron absorption; if you have too much iron in circulation, your intestines decrease absorption. But this thermostat-like system only works effectively with the primary source of iron in the human diet: the nonheme iron variety found predominantly in plant foods. Once you have a sufficient amount of iron in your blood, your body is about five times more effective at blocking the absorption of excess iron from plant foods than from animal foods.69 This may be why heme iron is associated with cancer70 and heart disease risk.71 Similarly, heme iron is associated with higher risk of diabetes, but nonheme iron is not.72

If we remove iron from people’s bodies, can we decrease cancer rates? Studies have found that people randomized to give regular blood donations to reduce their iron stores appear to cut their risk of getting and dying from new gut cancers by about half over a five-year period.73 The findings were so remarkable that an editorial in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute responded that “these results almost seem too good to be true.”74

Donating blood is great, but we should also try to prevent the excess buildup of iron in the first place. The meat industry is working on coming up with additives that “suppress the toxic effects of heme iron,”75 but a better strategy may be to emphasize plant sources in your diet, which your body can better manage.

Getting Enough Iron on a Plant-Based Diet

Compared with people who eat meat, vegetarians tend to consume more iron (as well as more of most nutrients),76 but the iron in plant foods is not absorbed as efficiently as the heme iron in meat. While this can be an advantage in preventing iron overload, about one in thirty menstruating women in the United States lose more iron than they take in, which can lead to anemia.77 Women who eat plant-based diets do not appear to have higher rates of iron deficiency anemia than women who eat a lot of meat,78 but all women of childbearing age need to ensure adequate iron intake.

Those diagnosed with iron deficiency should talk with their doctors about first trying to treat it with diet, as iron supplements have been shown to increase oxidative stress.79 The healthiest sources of iron are whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and green, leafy vegetables. Avoid drinking tea with meals, as that can inhibit iron absorption. Consuming vitamin C–rich foods can improve iron absorption. The amount of vitamin C in a single orange can enhance iron absorption as much as three- to sixfold, so those trying to boost their iron absorption should reach for some fruit instead of a cup of tea.

//
PANCREATIC CANCER

My grandfather died of pancreatic cancer. By the time the first symptom arose—a dull ache in his gut—it was too late. That’s why we need to prevent it in the first place.

Pancreatic cancer is among the most lethal forms of cancer, with just 6 percent of patients surviving five years after diagnosis. Thankfully, it’s relatively rare, killing only about forty thousand Americans each year.81 As many as 20 percent of pancreatic cancer cases may be a result of tobacco smoking.82 Other modifiable risk factors include obesity and heavy alcohol consumption.83 As we’ll see, specific dietary factors may also play a significant role in the development of this deadly disease.

For instance, how the fat in one’s diet may contribute to pancreatic cancer risk has long been a subject of debate. The inconsistency of research findings on the impact of total fat intake may be partly because different fats affect risk differently. The previously mentioned NIH-AARP study was large enough to be able to tease out what kind of fat was most associated with pancreatic cancer. It was the first to separate out the role of fats from plant sources, such as those found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive and vegetable oils, versus all animal sources, including meats, dairy products, and eggs. The consumption of fat from all animal sources was significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk, but no correlation was found with the consumption of plant fats.84


//
Chicken and Pancreatic Cancer Risk

Starting in the early 1970s, a series of laws have restricted the use of asbestos, yet thousands of Americans continue to die every year from exposure to it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Environmental Protection Agency have estimated that over a period of thirty years, approximately one thousand cases of cancer will occur among people exposed to asbestos in school buildings as children.85

It all started generations ago with the asbestos workers. The first asbestos-related cancers occurred in the 1920s among miners digging up the stuff. Then came a second wave among shipbuilders and construction workers who used asbestos. We are now in the third wave of asbestos-related disease, as buildings constructed with asbestos are beginning to deteriorate.86

As the history of asbestos shows, to see if something causes cancer, scientists first study those who have the greatest exposure to it. That’s how we’re now learning about the potential cancer-causing effects of poultry viruses. There has been long-standing concern about the possibility that wart-causing chicken cancer viruses are being transmitted to the general population through the handling of fresh or frozen chicken.87 These viruses are known to cause cancer in the birds, but their role in human cancers is unknown. This concern arises out of studies that show that people who work in poultry slaughtering and processing plants have increased risk of dying from certain cancers.

The most recent, a study of thirty thousand poultry workers, was designed specifically to test whether “exposure to poultry cancer-causing viruses that widely occurs occupationally in poultry workers—not to mention the general population—may be associated with increased risks of deaths from liver and pancreatic cancers.” The study found that those who slaughter chickens have about nine times the odds of both pancreatic cancer and liver cancer.88 To put this result in context, the most carefully studied risk factor for pancreatic cancer is cigarette smoking. But even if you smoked for fifty years, you’d have “only” doubled your odds of getting pancreatic cancer.89

What about people who eat chicken? The largest study to ever address that question is the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, which followed 477,000 people for about a decade. The researchers found a 72 percent increased risk of pancreatic cancer for every fifty grams of chicken consumed daily.90 And that’s not much meat, under two ounces—just about a quarter of a chicken breast.

The researchers expressed surprise that it was the consumption of poultry—not red meat—that was more closely tied to cancer. When a similar result was found for lymphomas and leukemias, the same EPIC research team acknowledged that while the growth-promoting drugs fed to chickens and turkeys could be playing a role, it might also be cancer viruses found in poultry.91

The reason the connection between asbestos and cancer was comparatively easy to nail down is that asbestos caused a particularly unusual cancer (mesothelioma), which was virtually unknown before widespread asbestos use.92 But because the pancreatic cancer one might get from eating chicken is the same pancreatic cancer one might get from smoking cigarettes, it’s more difficult to tease out a cause-and-effect relationship. There are diseases unique to the meat industry, such as the newly described “salami brusher’s disease” that only affects people whose full-time job is to wire-brush off the white mold that naturally grows on salami.93 But most diseases suffered by meat industry workers are more universal. So despite the compelling evidence linking poultry exposure to pancreatic cancer, don’t expect an asbestos-type ban on Chick-fil-A anytime soon.

Treating Pancreatic Cancer with Curry

Pancreatic cancer is among the most aggressive forms of cancer. Untreated, most patients die two to four months after diagnosis. Unfortunately, only about 10 percent of patients appear to respond to chemotherapy, with the majority suffering severe side effects.94

Curcumin, the colorful component of the spice turmeric, appears able to reverse precancerous changes in colon cancer and has been shown in laboratory studies to be effective against lung cancer cells. Similar results were obtained using pancreatic cancer cells.95 So why not try using curcumin to treat patients with pancreatic cancer? In a study funded by the National Cancer Institute and performed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were given large doses of curcumin. Of the twenty-one patients the researchers were able to evaluate, two responded positively to the treatment. One had a 73 percent reduction in his tumor size, though eventually a curcumin-resistant tumor developed in its place.

The other patient, however, showed steady improvement over the course of eighteen months. The only time cancer markers bumped up was during a brief three-week period when the curcumin therapy was halted.96 Yes, the tumors of only two out of twenty-one participants responded, but that’s about the same as the chemo regimen, and zero adverse effects were reported with the curcumin treatment. As a result, I’d certainly suggest curcumin to pancreatic cancer sufferers regardless of what other treatments they choose. Given the tragic prognosis, though, prevention is critical. Until we know more, your best bet is to avoid tobacco, excess alcohol intake, and obesity and to eat a diet low in animal products, refined grains, and added sugars97 and rich in beans, lentils, split peas, and dried fruit.

//
ESOPHAGEAL CANCER

Esophageal cancer occurs when cancer cells develop in the esophagus, the muscular tube carrying food from your mouth to your stomach. Typically, the cancer arises in the lining of the esophagus and then invades the outer layers before metastasizing (spreading) to other organs. Early on, there may be few symptoms—if any at all. But as the cancer grows, swallowing difficulties can develop.

Every year, there are about eighteen thousand new cases of esophageal cancer and fifteen thousand deaths.99 The primary risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD, also called acid reflux), in which acid from the stomach gurgles up into the esophagus, burning the inner layer and causing inflammation that can eventually lead to cancer. Besides avoiding tobacco and alcohol (even light drinking appears to increase risk),100 the most important thing you can do to prevent esophageal cancer is to eliminate acid reflux disease—and that can often be accomplished through diet.


Acid Reflux and Esophageal Cancer

Acid reflux is one of the most common disorders of the digestive tract. The usual symptoms include heartburn as well as the regurgitation of stomach contents back up toward the throat, which can leave a sour taste in the mouth. GERD causes millions of doctor visits and hospitalizations each year and represents the highest annual cost of all digestive diseases in the United States.101 Chronic inflammation caused by acid reflux can lead to Barrett’s esophagus, a precancerous condition that involves changes in the esophageal lining.102 To prevent adenocarcinoma, the most common type of esophageal cancer in the United States, this sequence of events must be stopped—and that means halting acid reflux in the first place.

That’s a tall order in the United States. Over the past three decades, the incidence of esophageal cancer in Americans has increased sixfold103—an increase greater than that of breast or prostate cancer, and it may be chiefly because acid reflux is on the rise.104 In the United States, about one in four people (28 percent) suffer at least weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation, compared to just 5 percent of the population in Asia.105 This suggests that dietary factors may play a key role.

Over the past two decades, about forty-five studies have examined the link between diet, Barrett’s esophagus, and esophageal cancer. The most consistent association with cancer was the consumption of meat and high-fat meals.106 Interestingly, different meats were associated with cancers in different locations. Red meat is strongly associated with cancer in the esophagus itself, whereas poultry was more strongly associated with cancer down around the stomach-esophagus border.107

How does this happen? Within five minutes of eating fat, your sphincter muscle at the top of your stomach—which acts like a valve to keep down food inside the stomach—relaxes, allowing acids to creep back up into the esophagus.108 For example, in one study, volunteers consuming a high-fat meal (McDonald’s sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich) experienced more acid squirting up into their esophagus than those eating a lower-fat meal (McDonald’s hotcakes).109 Part of this effect may be due to the release of a hormone called cholecystokinin, which is triggered by both meat110 and eggs111 and may also relax the sphincter.112 This helps explain why those who eat meat have been found to have twice the odds of reflux-induced esophageal inflammation compared with vegetarians.113

Even without the cancer risk, GERD itself can cause pain, bleeding, and scar-tissue narrowing of the esophagus that can interfere with swallowing. Billions of dollars are spent on medications to alleviate heartburn and acid reflux by reducing the amount of stomach acid produced, but these drugs can contribute to nutrient deficiencies and increase the risk of pneumonia, intestinal infections, and bone fractures.114 Perhaps the better strategy would be to just keep the acid in its place by minimizing the intake of foods that allow acid to escape.

The protection afforded by plant-based eating may not be based just on the foods that are reduced, though. Centering your diet around antioxidant-rich plant foods may cut in half your odds of esophageal cancer.115 The most protective foods for cancer at the esophagus-stomach border appear to be red, orange, and dark-green leafy vegetables, berries, apples, and citrus fruits,116 but all unprocessed plant foods have the advantage of containing fiber.


//Fiber and Hiatal Hernia

While fat intake is associated with increased risk of reflux, fiber intake appears to decrease that risk.117 High fiber intake may reduce the incidence of esophageal cancer by as much as one-third118 by helping to prevent the root cause of many cases of acid reflux: the herniation of part of the stomach up into the chest cavity.

Hiatal hernia, as this condition is known, occurs when part of the stomach is pushed up through the diaphragm into the chest. More than one in five Americans suffer from hiatal hernias. In contrast, hiatal hernias are almost unheard of among populations whose diets are plant based, with rates closer to one in a thousand.119 This is thought to be because they smoothly pass large, soft stools.120

People who don’t eat an abundance of whole plant foods have smaller, firmer stools that can be difficult to pass. (See box here.) If you regularly strain to push out stool, over time the increased pressure can push part of the stomach up and out of the abdomen, allowing acid to flow up toward the throat.121

This same pressure from straining on the toilet week after week can cause other problems. Similar to the way squeezing a stress ball causes a balloon bubble to pop out, the pressure from straining at the toilet may herniate outpouchings from the wall of the colon, a condition known as diverticulosis. The increased abdominal pressure may also back up blood flow in the veins around the anus, causing hemorrhoids, and even push blood flow back into the legs, resulting in varicose veins.122 But a fiber-rich diet can relieve the pressure in both directions. Those who eat diets that revolve around whole plant foods tend to pass such effortless bowel movements that their stomachs stay where they’re supposed to,123 which can reduce the acid spillover implicated in one of our deadliest cancers.


//
Can Strawberries Reverse the Development of Esophageal Cancer?

Esophageal cancer joins pancreatic cancer as one of the gravest diagnoses imaginable. The five-year survival rate is less than 20 percent,124 with most people dying within the first year after diagnosis.125 This underscores the need to prevent, stop, or reverse the disease process as early as possible.

Researchers decided to put berries to the test. In a randomized clinical trial of powdered strawberries in patients with precancerous lesions in their esophagus, subjects ate one to two ounces of freeze-dried strawberries every day for six months—that’s the daily equivalent of about a pound of fresh strawberries.126

All of the study participants started out with either mild or moderate precancerous disease, but, amazingly, the progression of the disease was reversed in about 80 percent of the patients in the high-dose strawberry group. Most of these precancerous lesions either regressed from moderate to mild or disappeared entirely. Half of those on the high-dose strawberry treatment walked away disease-free.127

*************************************************************
Fiber consumption doesn’t just take off the pressure. Humans evolved eating huge amounts of fiber, likely in excess of one hundred grams daily.128 That’s up to about ten times what the average person eats today.129 Because plants don’t tend to run as fast as animals, the bulk of our diet used to be made up of a lot of bulk. In addition to keeping you regular, fiber binds to toxins, such as lead and mercury, and flushes them away (pun intended!).130 Our bodies were designed to expect an ever-flowing fiber stream, so it dumps such unwanted waste products as excess cholesterol and estrogen into the intestines, assuming they will be swept away. But if you aren’t constantly filling your bowels with plant foods, the only natural source of fiber, unwanted waste products can get reabsorbed and undermine your body’s attempts at detoxifying itself. Only 3 percent of Americans may even reach the recommended minimum daily intake of fiber, making it one of the most widespread nutrient deficiencies in the United States.

How Not to Die from Infections

I was still in medical school when I got a call to help defend Oprah Winfrey, who was being sued by a cattle rancher under a Texas food-disparagement law (thirteen states have so-called food-libel laws that make it illegal to make a comment that unfairly “implies that [a] perishable food product is not safe for consumption by the public”1).

Oprah had been talking on her television show with Howard Lyman, a former fourth-generation cattle rancher who decried the cannibalistic feeding of cow parts to other cows, a risky practice blamed for the emergence and spread of mad cow disease. Repulsed by the thought, Oprah told the viewing audience, “It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger.” The next day, cattle futures tumbled, and the Texas cattleman claimed to have lost millions.

My job was to help establish that Lyman’s comments were “based on reasonable and reliable scientific inquiry, facts, or data.”2 Despite the ease with which we did just that, not to mention the blatant violation of First Amendment protections inherent in the law, the Texas cattleman was able to tie Oprah up in a long and harrowing appeals process. Finally, five years later, a federal judge dismissed the case with prejudice, ending Oprah’s ordeal.

************************************ If Oprah was tied for years in a lawsuit, what can you do in a similar situation ? ************
In a narrow legal sense, she won. But if the meat industry is able to drag one of the country’s richest and most powerful people through the courts for years and cost her a small fortune in legal fees, what kind of chilling effect does that have on others who want to speak out? Now the meat industry is trying to pass so-called ag-gag laws, which make it illegal to take pictures inside their operations. Presumably, they fear people might be less inclined to buy their products if they knew how these products are made.3

Thankfully, humanity dodged a bullet with mad cow disease. Nearly an entire generation in Britain was exposed to infected beef, but only a few hundred people died. We weren’t as lucky with swine flu, which the CDC estimates killed twelve thousand Americans.4 Nearly three-quarters of all emerging and reemerging human diseases arise from the animal kingdom.5

Humanity’s dominion over animals has unleashed a veritable Pandora’s ark of infectious diseases. Most modern human infectious diseases were unknown before domestication led to a mass spillover of animal disease into human populations.6 For example, tuberculosis appears to have been originally acquired through the domestication of goats7 but now infects nearly one-third of humanity.8 Meanwhile, measles9 and smallpox10 may have arisen from mutant cattle viruses. We domesticated pigs and got whooping cough, we domesticated chickens and got typhoid fever, and we domesticated ducks and got influenza.11 Leprosy may have come from water buffalo and the cold virus from horses.12 How often did wild horses have the opportunity to sneeze into humans’ faces until they were broken and bridled? Before then, the common cold was presumably common only to them.

Once pathogens jump the species barrier, they can then transmit person-to-person. HIV, a virus thought to have originated from the butchering of primates in Africa for the bush-meat trade,13 causes AIDS by weakening the immune system. The opportunistic fungal, viral, and bacterial infections AIDS patients contract—but to which healthy people are resistant—demonstrate the importance of baseline immune function. Your immune system is not just active when you’re lying in bed sick spiking a fever—it’s involved in a daily life-or-death struggle to save your life from the pathogens that surround and live inside you.

With every breath you take, you inhale thousands of bacteria,14 and with every bite you eat, you can ingest millions more.15 Most of these tiny germs are completely harmless, but some can cause serious infectious diseases, occasionally making headlines with sinister-sounding names like SARS or Ebola. Although many of these exotic pathogens receive a lot of press coverage, more lives are lost to some of our most common infections. For example, such respiratory infections as influenza and pneumonia kill nearly fifty-seven thousand Americans each year.

Bear in mind that you don’t need to come in contact with a sick person to fall ill with an infection. There are latent infections that may exist within you, waiting to strike should your immune function falter. That is why it’s not enough to just wash your hands; you have to keep your immune system healthy.


//
Protecting Others

To protect others when you’re sick, you need to practice good respiratory etiquette by coughing or sneezing into the crook of your arm (into your bent elbow). This practice limits the dispersal of respiratory droplets and also avoids contaminating your hands. The Mayo Clinic has a slogan worth remembering: “The ten worst sources of contagion are our fingers.” When you cough into your hand, you can transfer contagion to everything from elevator buttons and light switches to gas pumps and toilet handles.17 It’s no surprise that during flu season, the influenza virus can be found on more than 50 percent of common household and day-care-center surfaces.18

Ideally, you should sanitize your hands after every bathroom visit and handshake, before all food preparation, and before touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after coming in contact with public surfaces. The latest recommendations from the World Health Organization favor the use of alcohol-based sanitizing rubs or gels over hand washing for routine disinfection of your hands throughout the day. (Products containing between 60 and 80 percent alcohol were found to be more effective than soap in every scientific study available for review.) The only time hand washing is preferable is when they are dirty or visibly contaminated with bodily fluids. For routine decontamination—that is, for all other times—alcohol-based products are the preferred method for hand sanitation.19

Still, some germs will always get past your first line of defense of practicing good hand hygiene. This is why you need to keep your immune system functioning at peak performance with a healthy diet and lifestyle.

//
PREVENTING INFECTIOUS DISEASES WITH A HEALTHY IMMUNE SYSTEM

The term “immune system” is derived from the Latin word immunis, meaning untaxed or untouched, which is fitting, given that the immune system protects the body from foreign invaders. Composed of various organs, white blood cells, and proteins called antibodies that form alliances against trespassing pathogens threatening the body, the immune system, apart from the nervous system, is the most complex organ system humans possess.20

Your first layer of protection against intruders are physical surface barriers like your skin. Beneath that are white blood cells, such as neutrophils that attack and engulf pathogens directly, and natural killer cells that put your cells out of their misery if they become cancerous or infected with a virus. How do natural killer cells recognize pathogens and infected cells? They are often marked for destruction by antibodies, which are special proteins made by another type of white blood cell, known as B cells, that home in like smart bombs and stick to invaders.

Each B cell makes one type of antibody that’s specific for one foreign molecular signature. You don’t have one B cell that covers grass pollen and another that covers bacteria; instead, you have a B cell whose only job is to make antibodies against the pollen of purple Siberian onion grass and another whose only job is to make antibodies against the tail proteins of bacteria that live in the thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. If each of your B cells produces only one type of antibody, then you’d need to have a billion different types of B cells given the incredible variety of potential pathogens on our planet. And you do!

Let’s suppose one day you’re walking along and suddenly get attacked by a platypus (they have poisonous spurs on their heels, you know). For your whole life up until that point, the B cell in your body that produces antibodies against duck-billed platypus venom was just hanging around, twiddling its thumbs, until that very moment. As soon as the venom is detected, this specific B cell begins dividing like crazy, and soon you have a whole swarm of clones each producing millions of antibodies against platypus poison. You fend off the toxin and live happily ever after. That is how the immune system works—aren’t our bodies spectacular?

As you get older, though, your immune function declines. Is this just an inevitable consequence of aging? Or could it be because dietary quality also tends to go down in older populations? To test the theory that inadequate nutrition could help explain the loss in immune function as you age, researchers split eighty-three volunteers between sixty-five and eighty-five years old into two groups. The control group ate fewer than three daily servings of fruits and vegetables, while the experimental group consumed at least five servings a day. They were all then vaccinated against pneumonia, a practice recommended for all adults over the age of sixty-five.21 The goal of vaccination is to prime your immune system to produce antibodies against a specific pneumonia pathogen should you ever become exposed. Compared with the control group, people eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables had an 82 percent greater protective antibody response to the vaccine—and this was after only a few months of eating just a few extra servings of fruits and vegetables a day.22 That is how much control the fork may exert over immune function.

Certain fruits and vegetables may give the immune function an extra boost.

Kale

Americans eat far too little kale. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average American may consume about 0.05 pounds of kale each year.23 That’s about one and a half cups per person … per decade.

As a dark-green, leafy vegetable, kale is not only one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet—it may also help fight off infection. Japanese researchers tried dripping a minute quantity of kale on human white blood cells in a petri dish, about one-millionth of a gram of kale protein. Even that miniscule quantity triggered a quintupling of antibody production in the cells.24

The researchers used raw kale, but the scant amounts of kale Americans consume are often cooked. Does cooking kale destroy its immune-boosting effects? It turned out that even boiling the veggies nonstop for thirty minutes did not affect antibody production. In fact, the cooked kale appeared to work even better.25

However, this property was discovered in a test-tube study. Even kale aficionados don’t mainline it like heroin, which is presumably the only way intact kale proteins would ever come in direct contact with our blood cells. No clinical studies (that is, studies on real people) on kale have been performed to date. Big Kale, it seems, has yet to muster the research dollars. Currently, we have stronger evidence for the immune 
benefits of kale’s less pretentious cousin, broccoli.

Broccoli

As I’ve mentioned, your body’s greatest exposure to the outside world is through the lining of your intestines, which may cover more than two thousand square feet,26 which is about the floor area of an average house.27 But the lining is extremely thin—just fifty-millionths of a meter. In other words, the barrier separating your bloodstream from the world is many times thinner than a single sheet of tissue paper. This is because the body needs to absorb nutrients from food: If the gut lining were any thicker, nutrients would have trouble passing through. It’s a good idea for your skin to be waterproof so you don’t start leaking, but the lining of the gut has to allow for the absorption of both fluids and nutrition. With such a fragile layer between your sterile core and the chaos outside, you need to have a good defense mechanism in place to keep out the bad.

This is where the immune system comes in, specifically a special type of white blood cell called intraepithelial lymphocytes. These cells serve two functions: They condition and repair the thin intestinal lining, and they also serve as its first line of gut defense against pathogens.28 These lymphocytes are covered with “Ah receptors” that activate the cells.29 For years, scientists couldn’t find the key that fit into the Ah receptor lock. If we could figure out how to activate these cells, we might be able to boost our immunity.30

It turns out that key is contained in broccoli.

You may have been taught as a kid to eat your veggies, including cruciferous ones like broccoli, kale, cauliflower, cabbage, and brussels sprouts. But your parents probably didn’t tell you why you should eat them. Now we know that this family of vegetables contains compounds necessary for the maintenance of the body’s intestinal defenses. In short, broccoli is able to rally your immune system foot soldiers.31

****************************************************************************
Why did our immune systems evolve to depend on certain vegetables? Well, when do we need to boost our intestinal defenses? When we eat. The body uses up a lot of energy to maintain its immune system, so why remain on high alert 24-7 when we only eat a few times a day? Why would our bodies specifically use vegetables as the bat signal to assemble the troops? We evolved over millions of years eating mostly weeds—wild plants, including dark-green, leafy vegetables (or, as they were known back then, leaves)—so our bodies may have evolved to equate vegetables with mealtime. Vegetables’ presence in the gut works as a signal to 
upkeep our immune systems.32 So if we don’t eat plants with each meal, we may be undermining our bodies’ strategy to protect us.

Interestingly, the immune boost provided by cruciferous vegetables like broccoli not only protects us against the pathogens found in food but also against pollutants in the environment. We’re all constantly being exposed to a wide range of toxic substances—from cigarette smoke, car exhaust, furnaces, cooked meat, fish, dairy, and even from mother’s milk33 (as a consequence of what the mother was exposed to). Because some of these pollutants, such as dioxins, exert their toxic effects through the Ah receptor system, cruciferous compounds may block them.34

Other plants may also defend against toxic invaders. Researchers in Japan found that phytonutrients in such plant foods as fruits, vegetables, tea leaves, and beans can block the effects of dioxins in vitro. For instance, the researchers found that having phytonutrient levels in the bloodstream achieved by eating three apples a day or a tablespoon of red onion appeared to cut dioxin toxicity in half. The only catch was that these phytonutrient effects lasted only a few hours, meaning you may have to keep eating healthy foods, meal after meal, if you want to maintain your defenses against pathogens as well as pollutants.35

The ability to block toxins isn’t limited to plant foods, however. There is one animal product that has also been shown to potentially block the cancer-causing effects of dioxins—camel urine.36 So next time your kids don’t want to eat their fruits and veggies, you can just say, “Hey, it’s either the broccoli or camel pee. Your choice.”

//
Boosting Natural Killer Cell Activity with Berries

For disease prevention, berries of all colors have “emerged as champions,” according to the head of the Bioactive Botanical Research Laboratory.39 The purported anticancer properties of berry compounds have been attributed to their apparent ability to counteract, reduce, and repair damage resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation.40 But it wasn’t known until recently that berries may also boost your levels of natural killer cells.

They may sound sinister, but natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell that’s a vital member of the immune system’s rapid-response team against virus-infected and cancerous cells. They’re called natural killers because they don’t require prior exposure to a disease to be activated, unlike some other parts of the immune system that can only respond effectively after a history of exposure, as in the case of, say, chicken pox.41 After all, you don’t want to wait until your second tumor appears before your immune system starts fighting.

There are about two billion of these elite, special-ops fighters patrolling the bloodstream at any one time, but research suggests that you can bolster their ranks by eating blueberries. In one study, researchers asked athletes to eat about a cup and a half of blueberries every day for six weeks to see if the berries could reduce the oxidative stress caused by long-distance running.42 The blueberries succeeded, unsurprisingly, but a more important finding was their effect on natural killer cells. Normally, these cells decrease in number after a bout of prolonged endurance exercise, dropping by half to about one billion. But the athletes consuming blueberries actually doubled their killer cell counts, to more than four billion.

Blueberries can boost the number of natural killer cells, but are there any foods that can boost killer cell activity—that is, how effectively they fight cancer cells? Yes, it seems an aromatic spice called cardamom may be one. Researchers put some lymphoma cells in a petri dish and added natural killer cells, which were able to wipe out about 5 percent of the cancer cells. But after researchers effectively sprinkled on some cardamom, the natural killer cells became supercharged and eradicated even more cancer cells—up to about ten times more than without cardamom.43 No clinical trials have yet been done to try this out in cancer patients.

In theory, though, cardamom-infused blueberry muffins may increase the number of circulating natural killer cells in the body, as well as boost their cancer-killing instincts.


//
Unless you’ve suffered a major disruption in gut flora due to a course of antibiotics or an intestinal infection, it may be best to focus on feeding the good bacteria already living in your gut.49 What do your friendly flora eat? Fiber and a certain type of starch concentrated in beans. These substances are called prebiotics. Probiotics are the good bacteria themselves, whereas prebiotics are what your good bacteria eat. So the best way to keep your good bacteria happy and well fed is to eat lots of whole plant foods.

When you eat fresh produce, you can get both pre- and probiotics into your gut. Fruits and veggies are covered with millions of lactic acid bacteria, some of which are the same types used in probiotic supplements. When you make sauerkraut, for example, you don’t need to add a starter culture, because the bacteria are already naturally present on cabbage leaves. Including raw fruits and vegetables in your daily diet may therefore offer the best of both worlds.50

//
Boosting the Immune System with Exercise

What if there were a drug or supplement that could halve the number of sick days you take due to such upper-respiratory infections as the common cold? It would make some pharmaceutical company billions of dollars. But there is already something that can boost your immune system for free and by so much that you can achieve a 25–50 percent reduction in sick days. And it has only good side effects. What is it?

Exercise.

What’s more, it doesn’t take much of a workout to get results. Studies find that if you let kids run around for just six minutes, the levels of immune cells circulating in their blood increases by nearly 50 percent.52 At the other end of the life cycle, regular exercise can also help prevent age-related immune decline. One study found that while elderly, sedentary women have a 50 percent chance of getting an upper-respiratory illness during the fall season, those randomized to begin a half-hour-a-day walking program dropped their risk down to 20 percent. Among conditioned runners, though, the risk was just 8 percent.53 Exercising appeared to make their immune systems more than five times better at fighting infection.

While regular physical activity improves immune function and lowers respiratory infection risk, sustained and intense exertion may have the opposite effect. As you go from inactive to active, infection risk declines, but at a certain point, overtraining and excessive stress can increase the risk of infection by impairing immune function.57 In the weeks following marathons or ultramarathons, runners report a two- to sixfold increase in upper-respiratory-tract infections.58 Within a day of starting an international competition, elite soccer players were found to suffer a significant drop in their IgA production.59 This drop has been tied to upper-respiratory-tract infections during training. Other studies have found that IgA levels can drop after even just single bouts of overstrenuous exercise.

What can you do, then, if you’re a hard-core athlete? How can you reduce your chance of infection? Traditional sports medicine recommendations don’t appear to have much to offer: They’ll tell you to get a flu shot, avoid touching your eyes or picking your nose, and stay away from sick people.61 Gee, thanks. The reason these steps may be insufficient is that respiratory infections are often triggered by reactivations of latent viruses already inside the body, such as Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of mononucleosis. So even if you never came in contact with anyone else, as soon as your immune function dips, these dormant viruses can return and make you sick.


Thankfully, a number of foods may help maintain your immunity to keep the germs at bay.

First up is chlorella, a single-celled, freshwater, green algae typically sold as a powder or compressed into tablets. Researchers in Japan were the first to show that mothers given chlorella saw increased IgA concentrations in their breast milk.62 Although chlorella extract supplements failed to boost overall immune function,63 there is evidence that whole algae may be effective. In a study out of Japan in 2012, researchers rounded up athletes ripe for infection during the middle of training camp. Among the control group, who received no supplements, IgA levels dropped significantly during intense exercise. But among those who were given chlorella, IgA levels remained steady.64

One note of caution: A disturbing case report from Omaha, Nebraska, was published recently, entitled “Chlorella-Induced Psychosis.”65 A forty-eight-year-old woman suffered a psychotic break two months after starting to take chlorella. Her physicians told her to stop it and put her on an antipsychotic drug. One week later, she was fine. Chlorella had never before been linked to psychosis, so they initially presumed it was just a fluke. In other words, the psychosis may have just coincidentally begun after the woman started taking chlorella, and the reason she felt better after stopping it may have just been due to the drug kicking in. But seven weeks later, she was still on the drug and had restarted taking chlorella—and she became psychotic again. The chlorella was stopped, and her psychosis resolved again.66 Perhaps it wasn’t the chlorella itself that triggered the episode but some toxic impurity or adulteration. We don’t know. Given the scandalously ill-regulated supplement market, it’s hard to know what you’re getting when you try to buy “food” in supplement bottles.

***************************************************************
Another option for athletes who want to sustain their immune function is nutritional yeast. A 2013 study reported that you may more effectively maintain your levels of white blood cells after exercise by consuming a special type of fiber found in baker’s, brewer’s, and nutritional yeast.67 Brewer’s yeast is bitter, but nutritional yeast has a pleasant, cheese-like flavor. It tastes particularly good on popcorn.

The study found that after two hours of intense cycling, the number of monocytes (another type of immune system white blood cell) in subjects’ bloodstreams took a dip. But those who were given the equivalent of about three-quarters of a teaspoon of nutritional yeast before they exercised ended up with even higher levels of monocytes than when they started working out.68

That’s all well and good on a lab report, but does consuming yeast fiber actually translate to fewer illnesses? Researchers put that question to the test at the Carlsbad Marathon in California.

Runners who were given the daily equivalent of about a spoonful of nutritional yeast in the four weeks after the race appeared to have just half the rates of upper-respiratory infection compared to runners consuming a placebo. Remarkably, the runners on yeast reported feeling better too. When asked how they felt on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the best, the people taking the placebo reported about a four or five. On the other hand, the subjects on the nutritional yeast consistently reported feeling better, around a six or seven. Elite athletes normally experience mood deterioration before and after a marathon, but this study revealed that a little nutritional yeast may improve a wide range of emotional states, reducing feelings of tenseness, fatigue, confusion, and anger, while at the same time increasing perceived “vigor.”69 Pass the popcorn!

Do you suffer from seasonal allergies? Runny nose, itchy eyes, sneezing? While your allergies may make you feel lousy because your immune system is busily attacking things left and right, that same heightened state of alertness may have benefits for your overall health.

Individuals suffering from allergies appear to have a decreased risk for certain cancers.70 Yes, your immune system might be in overdrive striking out at harmless things like pollen or dust, but that same overvigilance may also take down budding tumors in the body. It would be nice if there were a way to boost the part of the immune system that fights infections while down-regulating the part that results in chronic inflammation (and all those annoying symptoms).

Mushrooms may just do the trick.

Just as algae can be thought of as single-celled plants, yeast can be thought of as single-celled mushrooms. Thousands of edible mushrooms grow naturally, with worldwide annual commercial production in the millions of tons.71 But check the nutrition label on a carton of mushrooms and you won’t see much beyond some B vitamins and minerals. Is that all mushrooms have? No. What you don’t see listed is the array of unique myconutrients that may boost our immune function.72

Researchers in Australia split people into two groups. One group ate its regular diet, while the other ate its regular diet plus a cup of cooked white button mushrooms every day. After just a week, the mushroom eaters showed a 50 percent boost in the IgA levels in their saliva. These antibody levels remained elevated for about a week before dropping.73 So, for sustained benefits, try to make mushrooms a steady part of your diet.

But wait. If mushrooms trigger such a dramatic rise in antibody production, shouldn’t we be concerned they may worsen the symptoms of allergic or autoimmune diseases? On the contrary, it seems mushrooms may have an anti-inflammatory effect. In vitro studies have shown that a variety of mushrooms, including plain white button mushrooms, appear to blunt the inflammatory response, potentially offering a boost in immune and anticancer function without aggravating diseases of inflammation.74 The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of its kind, published in 2014, confirmed an apparent antiallergy effect in children with a history of recurrent upper-respiratory-tract infections.75

//
Food Poisoning

Pathogens (from the Greek pathos, for “suffering,” and genes, meaning “producer of”) can also be found in what you eat. Foodborne illness, or food poisoning, is an infection caused by eating contaminated food. According to the CDC, about one in six Americans develops food poisoning every year. Roughly forty-eight million people are sickened annually—larger than the combined populations of California and Massachusetts. More than one hundred thousand of them are hospitalized, and thousands die, just because of something they ate.76

In terms of healthy years of life lost, the top five most devastating pathogen-food combinations are Campylobacter and Salmonella bacteria in poultry, Toxoplasma parasites in pork, and Listeria bacteria in deli meats and dairy products.77 One of the reasons animal foods are the leading culprits is that most foodborne pathogens are fecal pathogens. Because plants don’t poop, the E. coli you may get from spinach didn’t actually originate in the spinach; E. coli is an intestinal pathogen, and spinach doesn’t have intestines. The application of manure to crops has been found to increase the odds of E. coli contamination by more than fiftyfold.7


*******************************************************************
Eggs and Salmonella

The single greatest public health burden in the United States in terms of food poisoning is Salmonella. It’s the leading cause of food poisoning–related hospitalizations, as well as the number-one cause of food poisoning–related death.79 And it’s on the rise. Over the past decade, the number of cases has increased by 44 percent, particularly among children and the elderly.80 Within twelve to seventy-two hours after infection, the most common symptoms appear—fever, diarrhea, and severe abdominal cramps.81 The illness typically lasts between four and seven days, but among children and the elderly, the disease can be severe enough to require hospitalization—or funeral arrangements.

Many people associate Salmonella with eggs—and for good reason. In 2010, for instance, more than half a billion eggs were recalled due to Salmonella outbreaks.82 However, the egg industry mantra remained: Stop whining; eggs are safe. Responding to cries for a recall in an op-ed published in USA Today, the chairman of the industry trade group United Egg Producers insisted that “completely cooked eggs are completely safe eggs.”83 But what exactly does “completely cooked” mean?

The egg industry itself funded research on Salmonella and the various ways to cook eggs. What did they find? Salmonella in eggs can survive scrambled, over-easy, and sunny-side-up cooking methods. Sunny side up was found to be the riskiest. The industry-funded researchers bluntly concluded: “The sunny-side-up method should be considered unsafe.”84 In other words, even the egg industry itself knows that its product, prepared in a manner that millions of Americans eat on any given day all across the country, is unsafe. Actually, we’ve known this for some time. Twenty years ago, Purdue University researchers determined that Salmonella can survive in cooked omelets and french toast.85 Salmonella may even survive in eggs boiled up to eight minutes.86

Given all of this, it should come as no surprise that, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an estimated 142,000 Americans are sickened each year by Salmonella-tainted eggs.87 That’s an egg-borne epidemic each year in the United States. But eggs are “only” number ten on the worst pathogen-food combination list.

//*****************************************************
Poultry and Salmonella

Eating chickens, not their eggs, is actually the most common source of Salmonella poisoning.88 A nationwide outbreak of a particularly virulent strain of the bacteria was linked to our sixth-largest poultry producer, Foster Farms. It lasted from March 2013 until July 2014.89 Why did the outbreak last so long? It was largely because the company continued to churn out contaminated chicken despite repeated warnings from the CDC.90 Though the official tally of cases numbered only in the hundreds, the CDC estimates that for every confirmed case of Salmonella, another thirty-eight slip through the cracks.91 This means Foster Farms’ chicken may have sickened more than ten thousand people. When U.S. Department of Agriculture officials went in to investigate, they found that 25 percent of the chickens they sampled were contaminated with the same strain of Salmonella, likely the result of fecal matter found on the chicken carcasses.92

Mexico banned the importation of Foster Farms’ chicken, but in the United States, it remained available throughout the country.93 When a car manufacturer’s brakes malfunction, it announces a recall due to safety concerns. Why hasn’t Salmonella-tainted chicken been recalled? The U.S. Department of Agriculture once tried to shut down a company found to be repeatedly violating Salmonella standards. The company sued and won. “Because normal cooking practices for meat and poultry destroy the Salmonella organism,” the judges in the case concluded, “the presence of Salmonella in meat products does not render them ‘injurious to health.’”94

If proper cooking kills the bug, then why do hundreds of thousands of Americans continue to be sickened by Salmonella-contaminated poultry every year? It’s not like E. coli and medium-rare hamburgers—who undercooks chicken? The problem here is cross-contamination. Between the time the fresh or frozen bird is picked up from the store and when it’s slid into the oven, the germs on the chicken can contaminate hands, utensils, and kitchen surfaces. Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of the time, placing fresh chicken on a cutting board for a few minutes can transfer disease-causing bacteria.95 Then, if you put cooked chicken back on the same cutting board, there’s about a 30 percent chance that the meat will become recontaminated.96

Foster Farms’ tone-deaf response to the outbreak may actually prove the most foresighted: “It is not unusual for raw poultry from any producer to have Salmonella bacteria,” they quoted in a press release. “Consumers must use proper preparation, handling and cooking practices.”97 In other words, it should be considered normal for chicken to be contaminated with Salmonella. Eat at your own risk.

Why are American consumers placed at such high risk? Some European countries have gotten Salmonella contamination in poultry down as low as 2 percent. How? Because it’s illegal to sell chicken tainted with Salmonella. What a concept! They don’t allow the sale of fowl fouled with a pathogen that sickens more than a million Americans a year.98 In a meat industry trade publication, an Alabama poultry science professor explained why we don’t have such a “heavy-handed” policy: “The American consumer is not going to pay that much. It’s as simple as that.” If the industry had to pay to make it safer, the price would go up. “The fact,” he said, “is that it’s too expensive not to sell salmonella-positive chicken.”99


************************************************************
Fecal Bacteria on Meat

The contamination problem extends far beyond a single poultry producer. In a 2014 issue of Consumer Reports, researchers published a study on the true cost of cheap chicken. They discovered that 97 percent of chicken breasts found in retail stores were contaminated with bacteria that could make people sick.100 Thirty-eight percent of the Salmonella they found was resistant to multiple antibiotics; the CDC considers such pathogens to be a serious public health threat.101

As the Mayo Clinic rather indelicately put it, “Most people are infected with Salmonella by eating foods that have been contaminated by feces.”102 How does it get there? In slaughter plants, birds are typically gutted by a metal hook, which too often punctures their intestines and can expel feces onto the flesh itself. According to the latest national FDA retail-meat survey, about 90 percent of retail chicken showed evidence of contamination with fecal matter.103

Using the presence of bugs like E. faecalis and E. faecium as markers of fecal contamination, 90 percent of chicken parts, 91 percent of ground turkey, 88 percent of ground beef, and 80 percent of pork chops are tainted on the retail level nationally.104

While outbreaks of Salmonella infection have increased, E. coli infection from fecal matter in beef has decreased.105 Why is beef getting safer but chicken getting riskier?106 One likely factor is that the government was able to enact a ban on the sale of beef contaminated with a particularly dangerous strain of E. coli. But why is it illegal to sell beef known to be contaminated with a potentially deadly pathogen but perfectly legal to sell contaminated chicken? After all, Salmonella in chicken kills far more people than E. coli in beef.107

The problem dates back to a famous case in 1974 when the American Public Health Association sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for putting its stamp of approval on meat contaminated with Salmonella. Defending the meat industry, the USDA pointed out that because “there are numerous sources of contamination which might contribute to the overall problem,” it would be “unjustified to single out the meat industry and ask that the [USDA] require it to identify its raw products as being hazardous to health.”108 In other words, because Salmonella has also been linked to dairy and eggs, it wouldn’t be fair to force only the meat industry to make their products safer. That’s like the tuna industry arguing there’s no need to label cans of tuna with mercury warnings because you could also get exposed by eating a thermometer.

The Washington, D.C., Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the meat industry’s position, asserting that the USDA can allow potentially deadly Salmonella in meat because “American housewives and cooks normally are not ignorant or stupid and their methods of preparing and cooking of food do not ordinarily result in salmonellosis.”109 That’s like saying minivans don’t need airbags or seat belts, and kids don’t need car seats, because soccer moms don’t ordinarily crash into things.

//
Avoiding Chicken to Avoid Urinary Tract Infections

Where do bladder infections come from? Back in the 1970s, studies of women over time found that movement of bacteria from the rectum into the vaginal area preceded the appearance of bladder infections.110 It took another twenty-five years, though, before DNA fingerprinting techniques proved that E. coli strains residing in the gut serve as the reservoir for urinary tract infections (UTIs).111

Another fifteen years passed before scientists tracked down the ultimate culprit, the original source of some of the UTI-associated bacteria in the rectum: chicken. McGill University researchers were able to capture UTI-causing E. coli at the slaughter plants, tracing them to the meat supply and, eventually, to urinary specimens obtained from infected women.112 As a result, we now have direct proof that bladder infections can be a zoonosis—an animal-to-human disease.113 This is a critical discovery, since UTIs affect more than ten million women each year in the United States at the cost of more than $1 billion.114 Even worse, it turns out that many of the strains of E. coli in chicken that cause UTIs are now resistant to some of our most powerful antibiotics.115

Can’t we solve this crisis by simply distributing meat thermometers and making sure people cook chicken thoroughly? No—because of the cross-contamination issue. Studies have shown that handling raw chicken can lead to intestinal colonization even if you don’t eat any of it.116 In that case, it doesn’t matter how well you cook your chicken. You could incinerate it to ash and still walk away infected. After infection, the drug-resistant chicken bacteria was then found to multiply to the point of becoming a major part of the research subject’s gut flora.117

The reason most people have more fecal bacteria in their kitchen sinks than their toilet seats118 is likely because they prepare their chickens in the kitchen, not the bathroom. But what if you’re really careful? A landmark study, published as “The Effectiveness of Hygiene Procedures for Prevention of Cross-Contamination from Chicken Carcasses in the Domestic Kitchen,” put this question to the test. Researchers visited five dozen homes, gave each family a raw chicken, and asked them to cook it. After the bird was cooked, researchers returned to find bacteria from chicken feces—Salmonella and Campylobacter, both serious human pathogens—all over the families’ kitchens: on the cutting board, utensils, cupboard, the refrigerator handle, the oven handle, the doorknob, and so on.119

Obviously, people didn’t know what they were doing, so the researchers then repeated the experiment, but this time gave the families specific instructions. After they cooked the chicken, the subjects were told to wash these surfaces with hot water and detergent, specifically the cutting board, utensils, cupboard, handles, and knobs. Yet the researchers still found pathogenic fecal bacteria all over.120

Reading the study, you could tell the researchers were getting a bit exasperated. Finally, they insisted the subjects use bleach. The dishcloth used to clean up was to first be immersed in bleach disinfectant, and then the subjects were to spray a bleach solution on all surfaces and let it sit for five minutes. However, the researchers returned to still find Salmonella and Campylobacter on some utensils, a dishcloth, the counter around the sink, and the cupboards.121 The extent of the kitchen contamination was much less, but still, it appears that unless you treat your kitchen like a biohazard laboratory, the only way to guarantee you’re not going to leave fecal pathogens around the kitchen is to not bring them into your house in the first place.

There is some good news: It’s not as if you eat chicken once and your gut is colonized for life. In the study in which volunteers became infected after just handling the meat, the chicken bacteria that tried to take over their gut only seemed to last about ten days.122 The good bacteria in their guts seemed able to muscle the bad guys out of the way. The problem, unfortunately, is that people tend to eat chicken more than once every ten days, so they may be constantly reintroducing these chicken bugs into their systems.

//
Yersinia in Pork

Nearly one hundred thousand Americans are sickened each year by Yersinia bacteria.123 In every outbreak for which a source has been found, the culprit was contaminated pork.124

In most cases, Yersinia food poisoning leads to little more than acute gastroenteritis, but the symptoms can become severe and mirror appendicitis, resulting in unnecessary emergency surgeries.125 Long-term consequences of Yersinia infection include chronic inflammation of the eyes, kidneys, heart, and joints.126 Studies have found that within a year of contracting Yersinia food poisoning, victims appear forty-seven times more likely to come down with autoimmune arthritis,127 and the bacteria may also play a role in triggering an autoimmune thyroid condition known as Graves’ disease.128

How contaminated are U.S. pork products? Consumer Reports magazine tested nearly two hundred samples from cities across the country and found that more than two-thirds of the pork was contaminated with Yersinia.129 This may be because of the intensification and overcrowding that characterizes most of today’s industrial pig operations.130 As noted in an article in National Hog Farmer entitled “Crowding Pigs Pays,” pork producers can maximize their profits by confining each pig to a six-square-foot space. This basically means cramming a two-hundred-pound animal into an area equivalent to about two feet by three feet. The authors acknowledged that overcrowding presents problems, including inadequate ventilation and increased health risks, but they concluded that sometimes, “crowding pigs a little tighter will make you more money.”131

Unfortunately, this situation is not expected to change anytime soon. Why? Yersinia bacteria do not cause clinical disease in pigs.132 In other words, it’s a public health problem, not an animal production problem. It doesn’t affect the industry’s bottom line. So instead of giving these animals a little more breathing room, the pork industry just largely passes along to society the estimated $250 million cost of sickening tens of thousands of Americans every year.

//
C. Difficile Superbugs in Meat

There’s a new superbug in town: Clostridium difficile. C. diff, as it’s commonly known, is one of our most urgent bacterial threats, infecting an estimated quarter-million Americans annually and killing thousands at a cost of $1 billion a year.134 It causes a condition called pseudomembranous colitis, which manifests as painful, crampy diarrhea. C. diff has traditionally been considered a hospital-acquired infection—something you pick up in health care settings—but it was recently discovered that only about one-third of C. diff cases can be linked to contact with an infected patient.135 What’s going on?

Well, another source of infection may be meat. The CDC found that 42 percent of packaged meat products sold at three national chain grocery stores sampled contained toxin-producing C. diff bacteria.136 The United States, it turns out, has the highest reported levels of C. diff meat contamination in the world.137

C. diff has also been found in chicken, turkey, and beef, but pork contamination has received the greatest attention from health officials, as it most closely matches the same strain found in non-hospital-related human infections.138 Since 2000, C. diff has increasingly been reported as one of the leading causes of intestinal infections among baby piglets.139 Carcass contamination with this diarrheal pathogen at the time of slaughter is considered the most likely source of the contamination of retail pork.140

Normally, C. diff won’t do anything to you. Even if it gets into your gut, your good bacteria can usually muscle it into submission. It can lie in wait, though, until the good guys are out of the way. The next time you have to take an antibiotic that disrupts your normal gut flora, C. diff can rear its ugly head and cause a range of inflammatory bowel conditions, including a life-threatening condition that’s as bad as it sounds: toxic megacolon.141 (It carries a mortality rate as high as a flip of a coin.)142

Doesn’t cooking wipe out most bugs? Well, C. diff isn’t like most bugs. For most meat, 71 degrees Celsius is the recommended internal cooking temperature. But C. diff can survive two hours of cooking at that temperature.143 In other words, you could grill chicken at the recommended cooking thermometer temperature for two hours straight and still not kill the bug.

You’ve probably seen advertisements for those alcohol-based hand sanitizers that advertise they kill 99.99 percent of all germs. Well, C. diff falls into that 0.01 percent. They don’t call it a superbug for nothing. Residual spores of the pathogen have been shown to be readily transmitted with a handshake even after using hand sanitizer.144 As one of the lead researchers who discovered another superbug in the U.S. meat supply, MRSA,145 has advised,146 people who handle raw meat may want to wear gloves.

//
Antibiotic residues can then end up in the meat you eat. Studies have revealed that traces of such antibiotics as Bactrim, Cipro, and Enrofloxacin have been found in the urine of people eating meat—even though none of them was taking those drugs. The researchers concluded: “Consumption amounts of beef, pork, chicken, and dairy products could explain the daily excretion amount of several antibiotics in urine.”149 These antibiotic levels can be lowered, however, after merely five days of removing meat from the diet.150

Nearly every major medical and public health institution has come out against the dangerous practice of feeding antibiotics to farm animals by the ton just to fatten them faster.151 Yet the combined political might of agribusiness and the pharmaceutical industries that profit from the sales of these drugs has effectively thwarted any effective legislative or regulatory action, all to save the industry less than a penny per pound of meat.

Healthy living may help protect you against both airborne and foodborne illnesses. Eating more fruits and vegetables and exercising more frequently can boost your immune system to help you fight off respiratory infections like the common cold. And sticking to mostly plant foods can help prevent you from becoming another food poisoning statistic by reducing your exposure to some of the deadliest fecal pathogens.

How Not to Die from Diabetes

A few years ago, Millan, a member of the NutritionFacts.org community, was kind enough to share her story with me. When she was thirty years old, she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Millan had struggled with obesity all her life and suffered through the highs and lows of years of yo-yo dieting. She had tried nearly every fad diet she could find but, not surprisingly, would quickly gain back whatever weight she’d lost. Diabetes wasn’t a stranger to her. Millan’s parents, brothers, and aunt were all diabetic, so she figured that her own diagnosis was inevitable. It’s age related. It’s genetic. There was nothing she could do. Or so she thought.

Millan’s initial diagnosis was back in 1970, and she lived as a diabetic for two decades. Then, in the 1990s, she switched to an entirely plant-based diet and completely turned her life around. Today, her energy levels are better than ever, she looks and feels younger, and she’s finally been able to maintain a healthy weight. More than four decades after being diagnosed as a diabetic, Millan, now in her seventies, is fit as a fiddle. She even teaches high-intensity Zumba classes! She didn’t find some wonder drug or trademarked diet. She simply decided to eat healthier food.

********************************************
The disease called diabetes mellitus comes from two words: diabetes (Greek for “to pass through or siphon”) and mellitus (Latin for “honey sweet”). Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronically elevated levels of sugar in your blood. This is because either your pancreas gland isn’t making enough insulin (the hormone that keeps your blood sugar in check) or because your body becomes resistant to insulin’s effects. The insulin-deficiency disease is called type 1 diabetes, and the insulin-resistance disease is called type 2 diabetes. If too much sugar builds up in your blood, it can overwhelm the kidneys and spill into your urine.

How did people test urine before they had modern laboratory techniques? They tasted it. Diabetic urine can evidently taste as sweet as honey. Hence the name.

Type 2 diabetes has been called the “Black Death of the twenty-first century” in terms of its exponential spread around the world and its devastating health impacts. Instead of the bubonic plague, though, the pathological agents in obesity and type 2 diabetes are identified as “high-fat and high-calorie diets,” and instead of fleas and rodents, the causes are “advertisements and inducements to poor lifestyle.”1 More than twenty million Americans are currently diagnosed with diabetes, a tripling of cases since 1990.2 At this rate, the CDC predicts that one in three Americans will be diabetic by midcentury.3 Currently in the United States, diabetes causes about 50,000 cases of kidney failure, 75,000 lower extremity amputations, 650,000 cases of vision loss,4 and about 75,000 deaths every year.5

Your digestive system breaks down the carbohydrates you eat into a simple sugar called glucose, which is the primary fuel powering all the cells in your body. To get from the bloodstream into your cells, glucose requires insulin. Think of insulin as the key that unlocks the doors to your cells to allow glucose to enter. Every time you eat a meal, insulin is released by your pancreas to help shuttle the glucose into your cells. Without insulin, your cells can’t accept glucose, and, as a result, the glucose builds up in your blood. Over time, this extra sugar can damage the blood vessels throughout the body. That’s why diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, and stroke. High blood sugar can also damage your nerves, creating a condition known as neuropathy that can cause numbness, tingling, and pain. Because of the damage to their blood vessels and nerves, diabetics may also suffer from poor circulation and lack of feeling in the legs and feet, which can lead to poorly healing injuries that can, in turn, end as amputations.

Type 1 diabetes, previously called juvenile-onset diabetes, represents approximately 5 percent of all diagnosed diabetes cases.6 In most people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Without insulin, blood sugar rises to unsafe levels. Type 1 diabetes is therefore treated with injections of insulin, a type of hormone-replacement therapy, to make up for the lack of production. The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, though a genetic predisposition combined with exposure to such environmental triggers as viral infection and/or cow’s milk may play a role.7

Type 2 diabetes, previously known as adult-onset diabetes, accounts for 90–95 percent of diabetes cases.8 In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas can make insulin, but it doesn’t work as well. The accumulation of fat inside the cells of your muscles and liver interferes with the action of insulin.9 If insulin is the key that unlocks the doors to your cells, saturated fat is what appears to gum up the locks. With glucose denied entry into your muscles, the primary consumer of such fuel, sugar levels can rise to damaging levels in your blood. The fat inside these muscle cells can come from the fat you eat or the fat you wear (i.e., your body fat). The prevention, treatment, and reversal of type 2 diabetes therefore depends on diet and lifestyle.

The CDC estimates that more than twenty-nine million Americans are living with diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes—that’s about 9 percent of the U.S. population. Out of one hundred people you know, chances are six of them already know they are diabetic and about three have diabetes but haven’t yet been diagnosed. More than one million new cases of type 2 diabetes are diagnosed each year.10

The good news: Type 2 diabetes is almost always preventable, often treatable, and sometimes even reversible through diet and lifestyle changes. Like other leading killers—especially heart disease and high blood pressure—type 2 diabetes is an unfortunate consequence of your dietary choices. But even if you already have diabetes and its complications, there is hope. Through lifestyle changes, you may be able to achieve a complete remission of type 2 diabetes, even if you’ve been suffering with the disease for decades. In fact, by switching to a healthy diet, you can start improving your health within a matter of hours.

******************************************
What Causes Insulin Resistance?

The hallmark of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance in your muscles. As we’ve learned, insulin normally enables blood sugar to enter the cells, but when the cells are resistant and don’t respond to insulin as they should, it can lead to dangerous levels of sugar remaining in the bloodstream.

What causes insulin resistance in the first place?

Studies dating back nearly a century note a striking finding. In 1927, researchers divided healthy young medical students into multiple groups to test out the effects of different diets. Some were given a fat-rich diet composed of olive oil, butter, egg yolks, and cream; others were given a carbohydrate-rich diet of sugar, candy, pastry, white bread, baked potatoes, syrup, bananas, rice, and oatmeal. Surprisingly, insulin resistance skyrocketed in the fat-rich diet group; within a matter of days, their blood sugar levels doubled in response to a sugar challenge, far more than those on the sugar and starch diet.11 It took scientists another seven decades to unravel the mystery of why this happened, but the answer would provide the key to what causes type 2 diabetes.

To understand the role of diet, we must first understand how the body stores fuel. When athletes talk about “carb loading” before a competition, they’re referring to the need to build a fuel supply in their muscles. Carb loading is a more extreme version of what you do every day: Your digestive system breaks down the starch you eat into glucose, which enters your circulatory system as blood sugar and is then stored in your muscles to be used for energy as needed.

Blood sugar, though, is a little like a vampire: It needs an invitation to come into your cells. And that invitation is insulin, the key that unlocks the front door of your muscle cells so glucose can enter. When insulin attaches to insulin receptors on a cell, it activates a series of enzymes that escort in the glucose. Without insulin, blood glucose is stuck out in the bloodstream, banging on your cells’ front door, unable to enter. Blood sugar levels then rise, damaging vital organs in the process. In type 1 diabetes, the body destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, so very little insulin is present to let blood sugar enter your cells. But with type 2 diabetes, insulin production isn’t the problem. The key is there, but something has gummed up the lock. This is called insulin resistance. Your muscle cells become resistant to the effect of insulin.

So what’s jamming up the door locks on your muscle cells, preventing insulin from letting glucose enter? Fat—more specifically, intramyocellular lipid, the fat inside your muscle cells.

Fat in your bloodstream, either from your own fat stores or from your diet, can build up inside your muscle cells, where it can create toxic breakdown products and free radicals that block the insulin-signaling process.12 No matter how much insulin you produce, your fat-compromised muscle cells can’t effectively use it.

This mechanism by which fat interferes with insulin function has been demonstrated by either infusing fat into people’s bloodstreams and watching insulin resistance shoot up13 or by removing fat from people’s blood and seeing insulin resistance drop.14 We can now even visualize the amount of fat in the muscles using MRI technology.15 Researchers are now able to track the fat going from the blood into the muscles and watch insulin resistance rise.16 One hit of fat, and within 160 minutes, the absorption of glucose into your cells becomes compromised.17

Researchers don’t have to give their study subjects fat through an IV, though. All they have to do is feed them.

Even among healthy individuals, a high-fat diet can impair the body’s ability to handle sugar. But you can lower your insulin resistance by lowering your fat intake. Research has clearly shown that as the amount of fat in your diet becomes increasingly lower, insulin works increasingly better.18 Unfortunately, given the current diets of American children, we’re seeing both obesity and type 2 diabetes occur earlier and earlier in life.

Prediabetes in Children

Prediabetes is defined by elevated blood sugar levels that are not yet high enough to reach the official diabetes threshold. Commonly found among those who are overweight and obese, in the past, prediabetes was regarded as a high-risk state that presaged diabetes, but it was not thought to be a disease in itself. However, we now know that prediabetic individuals may already be experiencing organ damage.

Prediabetics may already have sugar damage to their kidneys, eyes, blood vessels, and nerves even before diabetes is diagnosed.19 Evidence from numerous studies suggests that chronic complications of type 2 diabetes begin occurring during the prediabetic state.20 To prevent diabetic damage, therefore, we need to prevent prediabetes—and the earlier, the better.

Thirty years ago, virtually all diabetes in children was assumed to be type 1. But since the mid-1990s, we’ve started to see an increase in type 2 diabetes among kids.21 What was once called “adult-onset diabetes” is now known as type 2 diabetes because children as young as eight are developing the disease.22 This trend can have devastating consequences: A fifteen-year follow-up study of children who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes found an alarming prevalence of blindness, amputation, kidney failure, and death by the time these kids had reached young adulthood.23

Why the dramatic rise in childhood diabetes? It’s likely due to the dramatic rise in childhood obesity.24 Over recent decades, the number of American children considered to be overweight has increased by more than 100 percent.25 Children who are obese at age six are more likely than not to stay that way, and 75–80 percent of obese adolescents will remain obese as adults.26

Childhood obesity is a powerful predictor of adult disease and death. For example, being overweight as a teenager was found to predict disease risk fifty-five years later. Such individuals may end up with twice the risk of dying from heart disease and a higher incidence of other diseases, including colorectal cancer, gout, and arthritis. Researchers have found that being overweight as a teen could be an even more powerful predictor of disease risk than being overweight as an adult.27

To prevent childhood diabetes, we need to prevent childhood obesity. How do we do that?

In 2010, the chair of the nutrition department at Loma Linda University published a paper suggesting that giving up meat entirely is an effective way to combat childhood obesity, pointing to population studies demonstrating that people eating plant-based diets are consistently thinner than those who eat meat.28

To study body weight, we usually rely on body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of weight that also takes height into account. For adults, a BMI over 30 is considered obese. Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight, and a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered “ideal weight.” In the medical profession, we used to call a BMI of under 25 “normal weight.” Sadly, that’s no longer normal.

What’s your BMI? Visit one of the scores of online BMI calculators or grab a calculator and multiply your weight in pounds by 703. Then divide that twice by your height in inches. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds and are 71 inches tall (five foot eleven), that would be (200 × 703) ÷ 71 ÷ 71 = 27.9, a BMI indicating that you would be, unfortunately, significantly overweight.

The largest study ever to compare the obesity rates of those eating plant-based diets was published in North America. Meat eaters topped the charts with an average BMI of 28.8—close to being obese. Flexitarians (people who ate meat more on a weekly basis rather than daily) did better at a BMI of 27.3, but were still overweight. With a BMI of 26.3, pesco-vegetarians (people who avoid all meat except fish) did better still. Even U.S. vegetarians tend to be marginally overweight, coming in at 25.7. The only dietary group found to be of ideal weight were the vegans, whose BMI averaged 23.6.29

**********************************************************************
So why aren’t more parents feeding their kids plant-based diets? There’s a common misconception in America that their growth will be stunted. However, the opposite may be true. Loma Linda University researchers found that children who eat vegetarian diets not only grow up leaner than kids who eat meat but taller, too, by about an inch.30 In contrast, meat intake is associated more with horizontal growth: The same researchers found a strong link between consumption of animal foods and increased risk of being overweight.31

Developing diabetes in childhood appears to cut life expectancy by about twenty years.32 Who among us wouldn’t go to the ends of the earth to enable our kids to live two decades longer?

//********************************
Saturated Fat and Diabetes

Not all fats affect our muscle cells in the same way. For example, palmitate, the kind of saturated fat found mostly in meat, dairy, and eggs, causes insulin resistance. On the other hand, oleate, the monounsaturated fat found mostly in nuts, olives, and avocados, may actually protect against the detrimental effects of the saturated fat.38 Saturated fats can wreak all sorts of havoc in muscle cells and may result in the accumulation of more toxic breakdown products (such as ceramide and diacylglycerol)39 and free radicals and can cause inflammation and even mitochondrial dysfunction—that is, interference with the little power plants (mitochondria) within our cells.40 This phenomenon is known as lipotoxicity (lipo meaning fat, as in liposuction).41 If we take muscle biopsies from people, saturated fat buildup in the membranes of their muscle cells correlates with insulin resistance.42 Monounsaturated fats, however, are more likely to be detoxified by the body or safely stored away.43

This discrepancy may explain why individuals eating plant-based diets are better protected from diabetes. Researchers have compared the insulin resistance and muscle-fat content of vegans versus omnivores. Because people eating plant-based diets have the advantage of being so much slimmer on average, the researchers recruited omnivores who weighed the same as the vegans they were studying so that they could see whether plant-based diets had a direct effect beyond the indirect benefit of pulling fat out of the muscles by helping people to lose weight.

The result? There was significantly less fat trapped in the deep calf muscles of vegans than in those of comparably slim omnivores.44 Those eating plant-based diets have been found to have better insulin sensitivity, better blood sugar levels, better insulin levels,45 and even significantly improved function of their beta cells—the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin in the first place.46

In other words, people eating plant-based diets appear to be better at both producing and using insulin.


//*******************************************************************
Preventing Diabetes by Eating More

Many population studies have shown that people who eat significant amounts of legumes (e.g., beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils) tend to weigh less. They also have slimmer waists, less obesity, and lower blood pressure compared to people who don’t eat many legumes.47 But couldn’t these benefits be due not to the legumes themselves but to the fact that people who eat more legumes may eat a healthier diet in general? To tease out the connection, researchers used the most powerful tool in nutrition research: the interventional trial. Instead of just observing what people eat, you change their diets to see what happens. In this case, they put legumes to the test by comparing extra legume consumption head-to-head against calorie restriction.

**************************************************************************
Reducing belly fat may be the best way to prevent prediabetes from turning into full-blown diabetes. Though calorie cutting has been the cornerstone of most weight-loss strategies, evidence suggests that the majority of individuals who lose weight by portion control eventually regain it. Starving ourselves almost never works long term. So wouldn’t it be great if instead we could find a way to eat more food to get the same weight-loss benefit?

The researchers divided overweight subjects into two groups. The first group was asked to eat five cups a week of lentils, chickpeas, split peas, or navy beans—but not to change their diets in any other way. The second group was asked to simply cut out five hundred calories a day from their diets. Guess who got healthier? The group directed to eat more food. Eating legumes was shown to be just as effective at slimming waistlines and improving blood sugar control as calorie cutting. The legume group also gained additional benefits in the form of improved cholesterol and insulin regulation.48 This is encouraging news for overweight individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes. Instead of just eating smaller portions and reducing the quantity of the food they eat, they can also improve the quality of their food by eating legume-rich meals.

Saturated fats may also be toxic to the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. At around age twenty, the body stops making new insulin-producing beta cells. After that, if they are lost, they may be lost for good.49 Autopsy studies have shown that by the time type 2 diabetes is diagnosed later in life, you may have already killed off half your beta cells.50

The toxicity of saturated fats can be demonstrated directly. If we expose beta cells to saturated fat51 or to LDL (“bad”) cholesterol in a petri dish, the beta cells begin to die.52 The same effect is not observed with the monounsaturated fats concentrated in fatty plant foods, such as nuts.53 When you eat saturated fat, both insulin action and insulin secretion are impaired within hours.54 The more saturated fat you have in your blood, the higher your risk may be for developing type 2 diabetes.55

Of course, just as everyone who smokes doesn’t develop lung cancer, everyone who eats excessive saturated fat doesn’t develop diabetes. There is a genetic component. But for those who already have a genetic predisposition, a diet with too many calories and rich in saturated fat is considered a cause of type 2 diabetes.

//*********************************************************************
Losing Weight with a Plant-Based Diet

As noted earlier, even if you don’t eat extra fat, the extra fat you wear may cause the spillover effect—the tendency for overstretched fat cells to spill fat into the bloodstream. The advantage of a whole-food, plant-based approach to weight loss is that there may be no need for portion control, skipping meals, or counting calories, because most plant foods are naturally nutrient dense and low in calories.

*********************Amount of food in a 100 calorie serving***********************

Steamed Broccoli 285 gr 		Tomatoes 555 gr 		Strawberries 310 gr


Grilled chicken breast 70 gr 	Cheddar Cheese 25 gr 	Baked white fish 105 gr

Fruits and vegetables, on average, contain about 80–90 percent water. Just as fiber can bulk up the volume of foods without adding calories, so can water. Experiments have shown that people tend to eat the same amount of food at a meal, regardless of calorie count—probably because stretch receptors in the stomach send signals to the brain after a certain volume of food has been ingested. When much of that volume is a zero-calorie component like fiber or water, that means you can eat more food but gain less weight.57

Figure 2 shows the amounts of broccoli, tomatoes, and strawberries that contain one hundred calories, compared with the quantities of one hundred calories of chicken, cheese, and fish. You’ll notice that even though the calorie content is the same, the volume of these foods is different. So it makes sense that one hundred calories of the plants would be more likely to fill you up, while the same one hundred calories from animal or processed foods may leave you half-empty.

That’s why whole-food, plant-based diets are great for people who like to eat, since you can basically eat as much as you want without worrying about counting calories.

A head-to-head randomized clinical trial found that a plant-based diet beat out the American Diabetes Association’s recommended diet for weight loss. This occurred without restricting portions the subjects ate and without requiring calorie or carb counting.58 Moreover, a review of similar studies found that, in addition to weight loss, individuals consuming plant-based meals experienced improved blood sugar control as well as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease compared with people who followed diets that included more animal products.59 Such are the benefits of a plant-based diet.

Diabetics are more likely to suffer from strokes and heart failure.60 In fact, diabetic patients without a history of coronary heart disease may have the same risk of heart attack as nondiabetic individuals with confirmed heart disease.61 In addition to improving insulin sensitivity better than conventional diabetic diets, the plant-based approach can also lead to a significant drop in LDL cholesterol, thereby reducing risk of the number-one killer of diabetics, heart disease.62 But how do people feel about making such a major shift in their diets? As Dr. Dean Ornish has quipped, are we all going to live longer, or is it just going to seem longer?63

Apparently, most people who switch to a plant-based diet are happy they did. One of the reasons there’s been such great compliance with plant-based dietary interventions is that people not only tend to get measurably better, they also tend to feel much better. In a recent randomized, clinical weight-loss trial, diabetics were split into two groups. Half were put on the conventional diabetic diet as recommended by diabetes organizations; the other half were prescribed a plant-based diet consisting mostly of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and nuts. At the end of six months, the plant-based group reported both a significantly better quality of life and significantly higher mood scores than those assigned to the conventional diet. Patients consuming the plant-based diet also felt less constrained than those consuming the conventional diet. Moreover, disinhibition decreased, meaning patients eating vegetarian food were less likely to binge, and the plant-based folks tended to feel less hungry as well—both of which could help these subjects sustain this way of eating in the long run.64 So not only do plant-based diets appear to work better but they may be easier to adopt long term. And with the improvement in mood they seem to bring, there may be benefits for both physical and mental health. (See chapter 12 for more on this topic.)

When it comes to maximally lowering diabetes risk, does it matter if you eat just a little meat? Researchers in Taiwan sought to answer that question. Traditionally, Asian populations have enjoyed very low rates of diabetes. In recent years, however, diabetes has emerged on a near-epidemic scale, coinciding with the Westernization of Asian diets. Rather than compare vegetarians to modern-day omnivores, these researchers compared vegetarians to those eating a traditional Asian diet, which customarily included very little fish and other meat. The women ate the equivalent of just a single serving of meat each week, while the men had a serving every few days.65

Both the vegetarian and traditional Asian diet groups were following healthy diets, avoiding soda, for example. Despite the similarities in diet among the four thousand study subjects and after accounting for weight, family history, exercise, and smoking, the researchers found that the vegetarian men had only half the odds of diabetes as the occasional meat eaters. The vegetarian women had 75 percent lower odds of diabetes. Those who avoided meat altogether appeared to have significantly lower risk of both prediabetes and diabetes than those who ate plant-based diets with an occasional serving of meat, including fish. The researchers were unable to compare the diabetes rates of the more than one thousand vegetarians in the study to the sixty-nine vegans in the group, however, because the prevalence of diabetes among those eating strictly plant-based was zero.

//****************************************************************
Diabetes-Promoting Pollutants

The dramatic rise in obesity has been blamed squarely on overeating and inactivity. But could there be something else about the food we’re eating that’s plumping us up? Scientists have begun identifying “obesogenic” chemical pollutants released into the environment that may disrupt your metabolism and predispose you to obesity. Contaminated food is the main source of exposure to these chemicals, and 95 percent of that exposure may come through the consumption of animal fat.67 What’s the big deal? A nationwide study found that people with the highest levels of pollutants in their bloodstreams had an astounding thirty-eight times the odds of diabetes.68 Harvard University researchers identified one chemical in particular, hexachlorobenzene, as a potent risk factor for the disease.69

Where is this toxin found? Apparently, at the grocery store. In a supermarket survey of a variety of foods, canned sardines were found to be the most heavily tainted with hexachlorobenzene, though salmon was found to be the most contaminated food overall. Two dozen pesticides were detected in the salmon fillets.70 Farmed salmon may be the worst, containing ten times more of a class of toxic chemicals called PCBs than wild-caught salmon.71

Industrial toxins like hexachlorobenzene and PCBs were largely banned decades ago. So how could they account for any of our increasing rates of diabetes? The answer to this paradox may be our obesity epidemic. The association between these toxic chemicals and diabetes was much stronger among obese subjects than in lean subjects studied, raising the possibility that your own fat stores are acting as reservoirs for these pollutants.72 Overweight individuals may be effectively carrying around a personal toxic waste dump on their hips. Without significant weight loss, people whose bodies contain salmon pollutants may take between fifty to seventy-five years to clear the chemicals from their bodies.

Do those who avoid meat completely get enough nutrients? To find out, researchers looked at a day in the life of thirteen thousand people all across America. They compared the nutrient intake of those who ate meat to those who didn’t. The study found that, calorie for calorie, those eating vegetarian diets were getting higher intakes of nearly every nutrient: more fiber, more vitamin A, more vitamin C, more vitamin E, more of the B vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, and folate, as well as more calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium. Furthermore, many of the nutrients that are so rich in plant-based diets are among the very ones that most Americans normally don’t get enough of—namely, vitamins A, C, E, not to mention fiber, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. At the same time, people who avoided meat also ingested fewer harmful substances, such as sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol.74

In terms of weight management, those eating meat-free diets consumed an average of 364 fewer calories daily.75 That’s about what most people on traditional weight-loss programs strive to cut out, meaning a meatless diet could be considered an all-you-care-to-eat version of a calorie-restricted weight-loss diet, without having to count calories or restrict portion intake.

Those who eat plant-based diets may even have an 11 percent higher resting metabolic rate.76 That means vegetarians could be burning more calories even in their sleep. Why? This could be because vegetarians have a higher gene expression of a fat-burning enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase, which effectively shovels fat into the mitochondrial furnaces in your cells.77

So a calorie may not be a calorie when it comes to meat. A massive study with an equally massive name, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer–Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of Smoking, Eating Out of Home, and Obesity—commonly known as EPIC-PANACEA—was comprised of hundreds of thousands of men and women who were followed for years. It’s the largest study ever to investigate eating meat and body weight, and it found that meat consumption was associated with significant weight gain even after adjusting for calories. This means that if you had two people eating the same number of calories, it appears the person eating more meat would, on average, gain significantly more weight.


//*******************************************************************
REVERSING DIABETES

What About Drugs and Surgery?

As noted earlier, those with type 2 diabetes are at elevated risk for such serious health problems as heart disease, premature death, blindness, kidney failure, and amputations, as well as fractures, depression, and dementia. And the higher people’s blood sugar levels, the more heart attacks and strokes they tend to have, the shorter their life spans are, and the higher their risk of complications are. To see if these outcomes could be averted, a study was performed in which ten thousand diabetics were randomized into one of two groups, the standard therapy group (in which the goal was just to lower blood sugar levels) and an intensive blood-sugar-lowering group (in which the researchers put the diabetics on up to five different classes of oral drugs at the same time) with or without insulin injections. The goal was not just to drive down blood sugars, as is the case with standard therapy, but to drive them down consistently into the normal range.79

Considering that type 2 diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance, high blood sugar is just a symptom of that disease, not the disease itself. So even by artificially forcing down blood sugars by any means necessary, we aren’t actually treating the cause—just like blood pressure–lowering drugs aren’t actually treating the cause. By lowering one of the disease’s effects, however, scientists hoped they could prevent some of its devastating complications.

The results of this study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, sent shock waves through the medical community. The intensive blood-sugar-lowering therapy actually increased subjects’ mortality, requiring the researchers to halt the study prematurely for safety reasons.80 The drug combinations may have been more dangerous than the high blood sugars they were trying to treat.81

Insulin treatments themselves may accelerate aging, worsen diabetic vision loss, and promote cancer, obesity, and atherosclerosis.82 Insulin can promote inflammation in the arteries, which may help explain the increased death rate in the intensively treated group.83 So rather than trying to overcome insulin resistance by brute force—just pumping in more and more insulin—isn’t it better to treat the disease itself by eliminating the unhealthy diet that caused it? That reminds me of people who undergo bypass surgery for clogged arteries. If they keep eating unhealthfully, their bypasses will eventually get clogged too. It’s better to treat the cause than the symptoms.

How about surgery for diabetes? Gastric bypass surgery—which effectively reduces the size of the stomach by 90 percent or more—is one of the most successful treatment methods for type 2 diabetes, with reported long-term remission rates of up to 83 percent. These results had led to the suggestion that gastric bypass surgery improves diabetes by somehow altering digestive hormones, but this interpretation ignores the fact that patients are placed on a severely limited diet for up to two weeks following the procedure to recover from the surgery. Extreme calorie restriction alone can reverse diabetes. So is the success of surgery the result of the operation itself or due to the restrictive diet?

Once again, researchers designed a study to uncover the answer.84 They compared diabetics placed on the same postoperative diet before and after they actually had the surgery. Amazingly, they found that the diet alone worked better than the surgery even in the same group of patients: The subjects’ blood sugar control was better in the absence of the operation. This means the benefits of major surgery may be obtained without you ever having to go under the knife and getting your internal organs rearranged.85

The bottom line: Blood sugar levels can normalize within a week of eating six hundred calories daily, because fat is pulled out of the muscles, liver, and pancreas, allowing them to function normally again.86

This reversal of diabetes can be accomplished either by voluntary calorie restriction87 or involuntarily, by having most of your stomach removed, a form of compulsory food restriction. Undergoing surgery may be easier than starving yourself, but major surgery carries major risks, both during the operation and afterward. These risks include bleeding, leakage, infections, erosions, herniation, and severe nutritional deficiencies.88

Surgery or starvation? There’s got to be a better way, and, in fact, there is. Instead of changing the quantity of food you eat, it’s possible to reverse diabetes by changing the quality of that food.


//****************************** The food we eat today is definitely not the food we used to eat in our hunter-gatherer period*************************

Does Eating Obesity Cause Obesity?

The EPIC-PANACEA study, which found that meat consumption is associated with weight gain even independent of calories, identified poultry as potentially the most fattening meat,89 a finding that has since been confirmed in another study. Men and women eating even a single ounce of chicken a day (think two chicken nuggets) had a significantly greater gain in body mass index over the fourteen-year follow-up period than those who consumed no chicken at all.90 Perhaps this news shouldn’t be surprising, considering how fat chickens themselves are now genetically manipulated to become.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about one hundred years ago, a single serving of chicken may have contained only sixteen fat calories. Nowadays, one serving of chicken may have more than two hundred calories of fat. The fat content in poultry has ballooned from less than two grams per serving a century ago to up to twenty-three grams today. That’s ten times more fat. Chicken now contains two to three times more calories from fat than from protein, leading nutrition researchers to ask, “Does eating obesity cause obesity in the consumer?”91 As the beef industry is proud of pointing out, even skinless chicken can have more fat, and more artery-clogging saturated fat, than a dozen different cuts of steak.


//********************************************
Reversing Diabetes with Food

We’ve known since the siege of Paris in 1870 that type 2 diabetes can be reversed by an extreme reduction in food intake. Parisian doctors documented how glucose disappeared from their patients’ urine after people went weeks without food.93 Diabetes specialists have long known that iron-willed patients who are able to lose up to one-fifth of their body weight can reverse their diabetes and bring their metabolic function back to normal.94

Instead of starving by eating less food, though, what if diabetics just ate better food, as in a 90 percent or more plant-based diet of all-you-can-eat greens, lots of other vegetables and beans, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and seeds? In a pilot study, thirteen diabetic men and women were told to eat at least one big salad every day, as well as veggie-bean soup, a handful of nuts and seeds, fruit at every meal, a pound of cooked greens, and some whole grains; to restrict their animal product consumption; and to eliminate refined grains, junk food, and oil. Then, the researchers measured their hemoglobin A1c levels, considered the best measure of how poorly blood sugars have been controlled over time.

At the onset of the study, the diabetics had A1c levels averaging 8.2. An A1c level under 5.7 is considered normal, between 5.7 and 6.4 is considered prediabetic, and above 6.5 is considered diabetic. However, the American Diabetes Association’s target is just to get most diabetics down below 7.0.95 (Recall that intensive blood-sugar-lowering trials using drugs, which tried to push A1c levels under 6.0, unfortunately ended up pushing many diabetics six feet under.)

After about seven months of eating a diet centered on whole plant foods, the subjects’ A1c levels dropped to a nondiabetic 5.8—and this was after they were able to stop taking most of their medications.96 We’ve known diabetes can be reversed with an extremely low-calorie diet.97 Now we know that it can also be reversed with an extremely healthy diet, but is that because it was also low in calories? The study subjects lost about as much weight on the vegetable-packed, plant-based diet as people who went on semistarvation diets based on liquid meal replacements.98 But even if this type of diabetes reversal was just about calorie restriction, which would be healthier? Subsisting on mostly diet shakes made out of sugar, powdered milk, corn syrup, and oil, or eating a plant-based diet where you can enjoy real food and lots of it?

Surprisingly, even participants who temporarily didn’t lose weight on the plant-based diet, or who actually gained weight, still appeared to improve their diabetes. In other words, the beneficial effects of plant-based diets may extend beyond weight loss.99 However, the study described just a handful of people, had no control group, and included only those who could stick to the eating plan. To prove plant-based diets could actually improve diabetes independent of weight loss, researchers would need to design a study in which they switched people to a healthy diet but forced them to eat so much that they didn’t lose any weight.

Just such a study was published more than thirty-five years ago. Type 2 diabetics were placed on a plant-based diet and weighed every day. If they started losing any weight, they were made to eat more food—so much that some of the participants actually had trouble eating it all! The result: Even with no weight loss, subjects on the plant-based diet saw their insulin requirements cut by about 60 percent, meaning the amount of insulin these diabetics had to inject dropped by more than half. Furthermore, half of the diabetics were able to get off insulin altogether, despite no change in body weight—just by eating a healthier diet.100

This wasn’t over the course of months or years, either. This was after eating a plant-based diet for an average of only sixteen days. Some of the subjects had been diabetic for two decades and had been injecting twenty units of insulin a day. Yet within two weeks of eating a plant-based diet, they were off insulin altogether. One patient was on thirty-two units of insulin per day at the onset of the study. After eighteen days, his blood sugar levels plummeted so low that insulin injections were no longer necessary. Even at approximately the same body weight, he had lower blood sugars on a plant-based diet using no insulin than when he had been on a regular diet using thirty-two units of insulin daily.101 That’s the power of plants.

//*********************************************************************8
Curing Diabetic Neuropathy

Up to 50 percent of diabetics eventually develop neuropathy, or damage to their nerves.102 Neuropathy can be very painful, and that pain is frequently resistant to conventional treatments. No medical treatment is considered effective for the condition.103 We doctors are left with only steroids, opiates, and antidepressants to try to ease our patients’ suffering. But then a remarkable study was published, entitled “Regression of Diabetic Neuropathy with Total Vegetarian (Vegan) Diet.” Twenty-one diabetics who had been suffering from painful neuropathy for up to ten years were placed on a whole-food, plant-based diet. After years and years of suffering, seventeen out of the twenty-one patients reported that they felt complete relief from their pain—within days. Their numbness noticeably improved too. And the side effects were all good: The diabetics lost an average of ten pounds, their blood sugar levels dropped, their insulin needs dropped in half, and, in five of the patients, not only was their painful neuropathy cured, so was, apparently, their diabetes. After having been diabetic for up to twenty years, they were off all blood sugar drugs in less than a month.104

********************************** Make sure you are monitored. If your doctor discourages you from a plant based diet, go to another. Try to get rid of you diabetes and get off your medicine, but you have to be monitored. ***************************************************
	
	On top of that, the diabetics’ triglyceride and cholesterol levels improved on average as well. High blood pressures dropped by so much that half of the subjects also appeared cured of their hypertension. Within three weeks, the subjects’ need for high blood pressure medications dropped by 80 percent.105 (This is why it is critically important to work with your doctor when radically improving your diet, because if they don’t reduce or eliminate your medications accordingly, your blood sugar levels or blood pressure may drop too low.)

We’ve long known that plant-based diets can reverse diabetes106 and hypertension,107 but reversing nerve damage pain with diet was new.

This study involved a live-in program in which patients were provided meals. What happened after they were sent home, back into the real world? These seventeen subjects were followed for years, and in all cases but one, the relief from their painful neuropathy continued—or improved even further. How were the researchers able to achieve such a high degree of dietary compliance even in an uncontrolled setting? “Pain and ill health,” the researchers wrote, “are strong motivating factors.”108 In other words: Because plant-based diets work.

Think about it. Patients walk in with one of the most painful, frustrating, and hard-to-treat conditions in all of medicine, and three-quarters of them were cured in a handful of days using a natural, nontoxic treatment—namely, a diet composed of whole plant foods. This should have been front-page news.

How could nerve damage pain be reversed so suddenly? It didn’t appear to involve the improvement in blood sugar control. It took approximately ten days for the diet to control the diabetes itself, but the pain was gone in as few as four days.109

The most interesting speculation was that trans fats naturally found in meat and dairy could be causing an inflammatory response in the patients’ bodies. The researchers found that a significant percentage of the fat under the skin of those who ate meat, or even just dairy and eggs, was composed of trans fats, whereas those who had been on a strictly whole-food, plant-based diet had no detectable trans fat in their tissues.110

The researchers stuck needles into the buttocks of subjects who had been eating different diets and discovered that people who had been on a whole-food, plant-based diet for nine months or more appeared to have removed all the trans fat from their bodies (or at least from their butts!).111 But their neuropathy pain didn’t take nine months to get better. It improved in closer to nine days. It’s more likely that this amazing reversal was due to an improvement in blood flow.112

Nerves contain tiny blood vessels that may become clogged, depriving the nerves of oxygen. Indeed, biopsies of leg nerves in diabetics with severe progressive neuropathy have shown arterial disease within the sural nerve in the leg.113 However, within days of eating healthier meals, blood flow may improve to the extent that neuropathy disappears.114 Within an average of two years of eating a plant-based diet composed mostly of rice and fruits, even diabetic vision loss can be reversed in as many as 30 percent of patients.115

So why didn’t I learn about any of this in medical school? There’s little money to be made from prescribing plants instead of pills. The neuropathy pain reversal study was published more than twenty years ago, and the blindness reversal studies more than fifty years ago. As one commentator wrote, “The neglect of this important work by the broader medical community is little short of unconscionable.”

//*********************************************************** Waist-to-Height Ratio
WHtR Versus BMI 

The body mass index (BMI) is a better predictor of disease than body weight alone, as BMI takes height into account. But BMI has long been criticized for not considering the location or the nature of your weight. Bodybuilders, for instance, have extremely low body fat but can have off-the-chart BMIs, because muscle is heavier than fat.

Today, it’s generally accepted that health risks can be determined as much by the relative distribution of body fat as by its total amount.117 What’s the worst kind? Abdominal fat—the kind that builds up around your internal organs. Having a potbelly may be a strong predictor of premature death.118

￼

Figure 3

Both the men in figure 3 have the same BMI, but the distribution of weight is different. People with the so-called apple shape, with body fat concentrated in the abdominal region, may have the lowest life expectancy.119

Fortunately, there may be an even better tool than BMI that we can use to gauge the health risks of body fat. It’s called Waist-to-Height Ratio, or WHtR.120 Instead of a scale, grab a simple measuring tape. Stand up straight and take a deep breath, exhale, and let it all hang out. The circumference of your belly (halfway between the top of your hip bones and the bottom of your rib cage) should be half your height—ideally, less. If that measurement is more than half your height, it’s time to start eating healthier and exercising more regardless of your weight.

Type 2 diabetes in the United States is reaching epidemic proportions. The CDC estimates that 37 percent of U.S. adults—and 51 percent of adults over sixty-five—have prediabetes. That’s eighty-six million people,122 most of whom will become full-blown diabetics.123 But type 2 diabetes can be prevented, arrested, and even reversed with a healthy-enough diet. Unfortunately, doctors don’t tend to educate their patients about diabetes prevention. Only about one in three prediabetic patients reports ever being told by their doctors to exercise or to improve their diets.124 Possible reasons for not counseling patients include a lack of insurance reimbursement for the extra time spent, a lack of resources, a lack of time, and a lack of knowledge.125 We’re just not training doctors how to empower the people they serve.

The current medical education system has yet to adapt to the great transformation of disease from acute to chronic. Medicine is no longer about just setting broken bones or curing strep throat. Such chronic diseases as diabetes are now the principal cause of death and disability in America, consuming three-quarters of the nation’s health care budget. Medical education has yet to recognize and respond to the changing nature of disease patterns, which now requires a focus on prevention and lifestyle change.126 How far behind the times is the medical profession? A report by the Institute of Medicine on medical training concluded that the fundamental approach to medical education has not changed since 1910.

Not long ago, I received an e-mail that helps sum up where we are. Tonah, a sixty-five-year-old Native American, had been on insulin for type 2 diabetes for the last twenty-seven years. He was told by his doctor that Native Americans were “genetically predisposed” to the disease. He just had to live with it, including the excruciating nerve pain, three heart stents, and erectile dysfunction. After watching my “Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death” video on NutritionFacts.org, his granddaughter convinced him to try a plant-based diet.

It wasn’t easy, since the nearest store with fresh food was fifty miles away. Nevertheless, in less than two weeks, he turned his life around. His nerve pain diminished dramatically, to the point where it no longer kept him up at night. He lost thirty pounds in a matter of months and no longer needed insulin. His own doctor couldn’t believe this was possible and ordered a CT scan to check for tumors. There weren’t any. Now he feels better than he has in years.

“I’m grateful that my granddaughter has stopped seeing me as a sick old man,” Tonah concluded his note. “I feel young again, Doc.”

How Not to Die from High Blood Pressure

The most comprehensive and systematic analysis of the causes of death ever undertaken was published recently in the Lancet, one of the world’s leading medical journals.1 Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Burden of Disease Study involved nearly five hundred researchers from more than three hundred institutions in fifty countries and examined nearly one hundred thousand data sources.2 The results allow us to answer such questions as “How many lives could we save if people around the world cut back on soda?” The best answer? 299,521.3 So soft drinks and their empty calories don’t just fail to promote health—they actually seem to promote death. But apparently soda isn’t nearly as deadly as bacon, bologna, ham, and hot dogs. Processed meat is blamed for the deaths of more than eight hundred thousand people every year. Worldwide, that’s four times more people than who die from illicit drug use.4

The study also noted which foods, if added to the diet, might save lives. Eating more whole grains could potentially save 1.7 million lives a year. More vegetables? 1.8 million lives. How about nuts and seeds? 2.5 million lives. The researchers didn’t look at beans, but of the foods they considered, which does the world need most? Fruit. Worldwide, if humanity ate more fruit, we might save 4.9 million lives. That’s nearly 5 million lives hanging in the balance, and their salvation isn’t medication or a new vaccine—it may be just more fruit.5

The number-one risk factor for death in the world they identified is high blood pressure.6 Also known as hypertension, high blood pressure lays waste to nine million people worldwide every year.7 It kills so many people because it contributes to deaths from a variety of causes, including aneurysms, heart attacks, heart failure, kidney failure, and stroke.

You’ve probably had your blood pressure taken at the doctor’s office. The nurse reads off two numbers, say, for example, “115 over 75.” The first number (“systolic”) represents the pressure in your arteries as your blood pumps from the heart; the second number (“diastolic”) is the pressure in your arteries while the heart is resting between beats. The American Heart Association defines “normal” blood pressure as a systolic pressure under 120 and a diastolic pressure under 80—or 120/80. Anything above 140/90 is considered hypertensive. Values in between are considered prehypertensive.8

Increased blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and can damage the sensitive blood vessels in your eyes and kidneys, cause bleeding in the brain, and even lead certain arteries to balloon and rupture. The fact that hypertension can damage so many organ systems and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, two of our leading killers, explains why it is the number-one killer risk factor worldwide.

In the United States, nearly seventy-eight million people have high blood pressure—that’s about one in three American adults.9 As you age, your blood pressure tends to get higher and higher. In fact, after age sixty, 65 percent of Americans can expect to be diagnosed with the condition.10 This has led many people, including doctors, to assume that high blood pressure, like wrinkles or gray hair, is just an inevitable consequence of getting older. However, we’ve known for nearly a century that this isn’t true.

In the 1920s, researchers measured the blood pressure of a thousand native Kenyans who ate a low-sodium diet centered around whole plant foods—whole grains, beans, fruits, and dark, leafy greens, and other vegetables.11 Up until age forty, the blood pressure of the rural Africans was similar to that of Europeans and Americans, about 125/80. However, as Westerners aged, their blood pressure began to surge past the Kenyans. By age sixty, the average Westerner was hypertensive, with blood pressure exceeding 140/90. What about the Kenyans? By age sixty, their average blood pressure had actually improved to an average of about 110/70.12

The 140/90 threshold for hypertension is considered an arbitrary cutoff.13 Just like having too much cholesterol or body fat, there are benefits to having a blood pressure that is even lower than the “normal” range. So even people who start out with a so-called normal blood pressure of 120/80 appear to benefit from going down to 110/70.14 But is it possible to do that? Look at the Kenyans—not only is it possible, it appears typical for people who live healthy, plant-based lifestyles.

Over a two-year period, 1,800 patients were admitted into a rural Kenyan hospital. How many cases of high blood pressure did they find? Zero. There also wasn’t a single case found of America’s number-one killer, atherosclerosis.15

High blood pressure, then, appears to be a choice. You can continue eating the artery-bursting Western diet, or you can choose to take off the pressure. The truth is that eliminating humanity’s primary risk factor for death may be simple. No drugs, no scalpels. Just forks.


***************************************** This is important ****************************
Sodium

The two most prominent dietary risks for death and disability in the world may be not eating enough fruit and eating too much salt. Nearly five million people appear to die every year as a result of not eating enough fruit,16 while eating too much salt may kill up to four million.17

Salt is a compound made up of about 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride. Sodium is an essential nutrient, but vegetables and other natural foods provide the small amounts of sodium you need in your diet. If you consume too much, it can cause water retention, and your body may respond by raising your blood pressure to push the excess fluid and salt out of your system.18

For the first 90 percent of human evolution, we likely ate diets containing less than the equivalent of a quarter teaspoon of salt’s worth of sodium a day.19 Why? Because we likely ate mostly plants.20 We went millions of years without saltshakers, so our bodies evolved into sodium-conserving machines. That served us well until we discovered that salt could be used to preserve foods.21 Without refrigeration, this was a boon to human civilization. It didn’t matter that the addition of salt to our food resulted in a general rise in blood pressure—the alternative was starving to death because all our food rotted away.

But where does that leave us now? After all, we no longer have to live off pickles and jerky. Humans are genetically programmed to eat ten times less sodium than we do now.22 Many so-called low-salt diets can actually be considered high-salt diets. That’s why it’s critical to understand what the concept of “normal” is when it comes to sodium. Having a “normal” salt intake can lead to a “normal” blood pressure, which can contribute to us dying from all the “normal” causes, like heart attacks and strokes.23

The American Heart Association recommends everyone consume less than 1,500 mg of sodium daily24—that’s about three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. The average American adult consumes more than double that amount, about 3,500 mg daily.25 Reducing sodium consumption by just 15 percent worldwide could save millions of lives every year.26

If we could cut our salt intake by about a half teaspoon a day, which is achievable by avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to our food, we might prevent 22 percent of stroke deaths and 16 percent of fatal heart attacks. That’s potentially more lives saved than if we were able to successfully treat people with blood pressure pills.27 Simply put, reducing salt is an easy at-home intervention that may be more powerful than filling a prescription from the pharmacy. Up to ninety-two thousand American lives could be saved each year simply by eating less salt.28

The evidence that sodium raises blood pressure is clear, including double-blind, randomized trials dating back decades.29 If we take subjects with high blood pressure and put them on a sodium-restricted diet, their blood pressure drops. If we keep them on the low-salt diet and add a placebo, nothing happens. However, if we instead give subjects salt in the form of a time-release sodium pill, their blood pressure goes back up again.30 The more sodium we give them secretly, the higher their blood pressure climbs.31

Even just a single meal can do it. If we take people with normal blood pressure and give them a bowl of soup containing the amount of salt that may be found in an average American meal,32 their blood pressure climbs over the next three hours compared to eating the same soup without any added salt.33 Dozens of similar studies demonstrate that if you reduce your salt intake, you reduce your blood pressure. And the greater the reduction, the greater the benefit. But if you don’t cut down, chronic high salt intake can lead to a gradual increase in blood pressure throughout life.34

Doctors used to be taught that a “normal” systolic blood pressure is approximately 100 plus age. Indeed that’s about what you’re born with. Babies start out with a blood pressure around 95/60. But, as you age, that 95 can go up to 120 by your twenties. By the time you’re in your forties, it can be up to 140—the official cutoff for high blood pressure—and then keep climbing as you get older.35

What would happen if, instead of consuming ten times more sodium than what your bodies were designed to handle, you just ate the natural amount found in whole foods? Is it possible your blood pressure would stay low your whole life? To test that theory, we’d have to find a population in modern times that doesn’t use salt, eat processed food, or go out to eat. To find a no-salt culture, scientists had to go deep into the Amazon rainforest.36

Strangers to saltshakers, Cheetos, and KFC, the Yanomamo Indians were found to have the lowest sodium intake ever recorded—which is to say the sodium intake we evolved eating.37 Lo and behold, researchers found that the blood pressures among older Yanomamo were the same as those of adolescents.38 In other words, they start out with an average blood pressure of about 100/60 and stay that way for life. The researchers couldn’t find a single case of high blood pressure.39

Why do we suspect it was the sodium? After all, the Yanomamos studied didn’t drink alcohol, ate a high-fiber, plant-based diet, had lots of exercise, and were not obese.40 An interventional trial could prove that sodium was the culprit. Imagine if we took people literally dying from out-of-control high blood pressure (known as malignant hypertension), a condition from which you go blind from bleeding into your eyes, your kidneys shut down, and your heart eventually fails. What if you put these patients on a Yanomamo-level salt intake—in other words, a normal-for-the-human-species salt intake?

Enter Dr. Walter Kempner and his rice-and-fruit diet. Without drugs, he brought patients with eye-popping blood pressures like 240/150 down to 105/80 with dietary changes alone. How could he ethically withhold medication from such seriously ill patients? Modern high-blood-pressure pills hadn’t been invented yet—Dr. Kempner conducted his work back in the 1940s.41 Back then, malignant hypertension was a death sentence, with a life expectancy of about six months.42 Nevertheless, he was able to reverse the course of disease with diet in more than 70 percent of cases.43 Though the diet wasn’t merely extremely low sodium—it was also strictly plant-based and low in fat and protein—Dr. Kempner is now recognized as the person who established, beyond any shadow of doubt, that high blood pressure can often be lowered by a low-sodium diet.

In addition to high blood pressure, salty meals can significantly impair artery function,45 even among people whose blood pressure tends to be unresponsive to salt intake.46 In other words, salt itself can injure our arteries independent of its impact on blood pressure. And that harm begins within thirty minutes.47

Using a technique called laser Doppler flowmetry, researchers are able to measure blood flow in the tiny vessels in the skin. After a high-sodium meal, there is significantly less blood flow—unless vitamin C is injected into the skin, which appears to reverse much of the sodium-induced suppression of blood vessel function. So, if an antioxidant helps block the sodium effect, then the mechanism by which salt impairs arterial function may be oxidative stress, the formation of free radicals in your bloodstream.48 It turns out that sodium intake appears to suppress the activity of a key antioxidant enzyme in the body called superoxide dismutase,49 which has the ability to detoxify a million free radicals per second.50 With the action of this workhorse of an enzyme stifled by sodium, artery-crippling levels of oxidative stress can build up.

After one salty meal, not only does blood pressure increase but the arteries actually begin to stiffen.51 This may be how we figured out thousands of years ago that too much salt was bad for us. Quoting from a translation of The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine, an ancient Chinese medical text, “If too much salt is used in food, the pulse hardens…”52 It turns out that we may not need a double-blind trial; maybe we just have to feed someone a bag of potato chips and take his or her pulse.

Unsurprisingly, the salt industry isn’t thrilled about the idea of us cutting back on salt. Back in 2009, the American Heart Association quoted the chair of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee as saying that Americans should reduce their sodium intake. The Salt Institute, a salt industry trade organization, accused her of having an “unhealthy prejudice” against salt, arguing that she had “pre-judged the salt issue.”53 This is like the tobacco industry complaining that people at the American Lung Association are biased against smoking. Of course, the Salt Institute wasn’t the only aggrieved party. Cheese, it turns out, ranks as a leading contributor of sodium in the American diet,54 and the National Dairy Council stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Big Salt in its condemnation of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommendations.

The salt industry has its own PR and lobbying firms to play tobacco-industry-style tactics to downplay the dangers of its product.56 But the real villains aren’t necessarily the salt-mine barons—it’s the processed food industry. The trillion-dollar processed food industry uses dirt-cheap added salt and sugar to sell us their junk.57 That’s why it’s not easy avoiding sodium on the typical American diet, since three-quarters of salt comes from processed foods rather than a saltshaker.58 By hooking you on hypersweet and hypersalty foods, your taste buds get so dampened that natural foods can taste like cardboard. Indeed, the ripest fruit may not be as sweet as Froot Loops.

But there are two other major reasons the food industry adds salt to foods. If you add salt to meat, it draws in water. This way, a company can increase the weight of its product by nearly 20 percent. Since meat is sold by the pound, that’s 20 percent more profits for very little added cost. Second, as everyone knows, eating salt makes us thirsty. There’s a reason bars put out free baskets of salted nuts and pretzels, and it’s the same reason soda conglomerates own snack-food companies. A cold drink and a salty snack go hand in hand. It may be no coincidence that Pepsi and Frito-Lay are part of the same corporation.59

Pop quiz! Which has been reported to contain the most sodium: a serving of beef, a serving of baked all-natural chicken, a large McDonald’s french fries, or a serving of salted pretzels?

The answer? Chicken. The poultry industry commonly injects chicken carcasses with salt water to artificially inflate their weight, yet they can still be labelled “100 percent natural.” Consumer Reports found that some supermarket chickens were pumped so full of salt that they registered a whopping 840 mg of sodium per serving—that could mean more than a full day’s worth of sodium in just one chicken breast.60

The number-one source of sodium for American kids and teens is pizza.61 A single slice of Pizza Hut pepperoni pizza can contain half your recommended sodium intake limit for the entire day.62 For adults over fifty, it’s bread, but between the ages of twenty and fifty, the greatest contributor of sodium to the diet is chicken—not the canned soups, pretzels, or potato chips one might expect.63

How can you overcome your built-in craving for salt, sugar, and fat? Just give it a few weeks, and your taste buds will start to change. When researchers put people on a low-salt diet, over time, the research subjects increasingly enjoyed the taste of salt-free soup and became turned off by the salt-heavy soup they had previously craved. As the study progressed, when the participants were allowed to salt their own soup to taste, they preferred less and less salt as their taste buds became acclimated to healthier levels.64

The same may be true for sugar and fat. It’s likely that humans actually taste fat, just like they taste sweet, sour, and salty flavors.65 People placed on low-fat diets start preferring low-fat foods over fatty options.66 Your tongue may actually become more sensitive to fat, and the more sensitive your tongue becomes, the less butter, meat, dairy, and eggs you eat. On the flip side, if you eat too much of these foods, you may blunt your taste for fat, which can cause you to eat more calories and more fat, dairy, meat, and eggs and ultimately gain weight.67 This can all happen in just a matter of weeks.68

There are three things you can do to shake the salt habit.69 First, don’t add salt at the table. (One out of three people may add salt to their food before even tasting it!)70 Second, stop adding salt when cooking. The food may taste bland at first, but within two to four weeks, the salt-taste receptors in your mouth become more sensitive, and food tastes better. Believe it or not, after two weeks, you may actually prefer the taste of food with less salt.71 Try any combination of such fantastic flavorings as pepper, onions, garlic, tomatoes, sweet peppers, basil, parsley, thyme, celery, lime, chili powder, rosemary, smoked paprika, curry, coriander, and lemon instead.72 Also, it’s probably a good idea to avoid eating out as much as possible. Even non-fast-food restaurants tend to pile on the salt.73 Finally, do what you can to avoid processed foods.

In most countries studied, processed foods provide only about half of people’s sodium intake, but in the United States, we consume so much sodium from processed foods that even if we completely stopped adding salt in the kitchen and dining room, we’d still only reduce our salt intake by a small fraction.74 Try to buy foods with fewer milligrams of sodium on the label than there are grams in the serving size. For example, if it’s a 100 g serving size, the product should have less than 100 mg of sodium.75 Alternatively, you can shoot for fewer milligrams of sodium per serving than there are calories. That’s a trick I learned from one of my favorite dietitians, Jeff Novick. Most people get around 2,200 calories a day, so if everything you ate had more calories than sodium, you would probably make it at least under the Dietary Guidelines for Americans’ upper limit of 2,300 mg of sodium a day.76

Ideally, though, you’d buy mostly food without any labels at all. It is considered almost impossible to come up with a diet consisting of unprocessed natural foods that exceeds the strict 1,500 mg a day American Heart Association guidelines for sodium reduction.

//****************************************************
Whole Grains

On average, high blood pressure medications reduce the risk of heart attack by 15 percent and the risk of stroke by 25 percent.78 But in a randomized, controlled trial, three portions of whole grains a day were able to help people achieve this blood-pressure-lowering benefit too.79 The study revealed that a diet rich in whole grains yields the same benefits without the adverse side effects commonly associated with antihypertensive drugs, such as electrolyte disturbances in those taking diuretics (also known as water pills);80 increased breast cancer risk for those taking calcium-channel blockers (like Norvasc or Cardizem);81 lethargy and impotence for those on beta blockers (like Lopressor and Corgard);82 sudden, potentially life-threatening swelling for those taking ACE inhibitors (like Vasotec and Altace);83 and an increased risk of serious fall injuries for apparently any class of these blood pressure drugs.84

Whole grains do have side effects, though. Good ones! Whole-grain intake is associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, weight gain,85 and colon cancer.86 Take note of the whole, however. While whole grains, such as oats, whole wheat, and brown rice, have been shown to reduce your risk of developing chronic disease,87 refined grains may actually increase your risk. Harvard University researchers, for example, found that while regular consumption of brown rice was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, consuming white rice was associated with higher risk. Daily servings of white rice were associated with a 17 percent greater risk of diabetes, whereas replacing one-third of a serving a day of white rice for brown rice might lead to a 16 percent drop in risk. And it looks like replacing white rice with oats and barley may be an even more powerful step, associated with a 36 percent drop in diabetes risk.88

Given the improvements in cardiac risk factors seen in interventional trials of whole grains,89 it’s not surprising to see a reduction in the progression of arterial disease among those who regularly eat them. In studies of two of the most important arteries in the body, the coronary arteries that feed the heart and the carotid arteries that feed the brain, people who ate the most whole grains had significantly slower narrowing of their arteries.90,91 Since atherosclerotic plaque in the arteries is our leading killer, ideally, you should not just slow down the process but actually stop or even reverse it altogether. As we saw in chapter 1, this appears to require more than just whole grains; whole vegetables, whole fruits, whole beans, and other whole plant foods are needed, along with a significant reduction in your intake of trans fats, saturated fats, and cholesterol, the food components that contribute to clogging your arteries shut.


//******************************************************
What About the DASH Diet?

What if you are among the seventy-eight million Americans who already have high blood pressure? How can you bring it down?

The American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) all recommend that patients first try lifestyle modifications, such as reducing body weight, limiting sodium and alcohol intake, getting more exercise, and eating a healthier diet.92

However, if their recommended lifestyle changes don’t work, then it’s off to the pharmacy. First up is a diuretic (water pill), and before you can spell “pharmaceutical cocktail,” the medications begin piling up until your blood pressure comes down. High blood pressure patients commonly end up on three different antihypertensive drugs at a time,93 yet only about half tend to stick to even the first-line drugs.94 (This is due in part to all their side effects, which can include erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and leg cramps.)95 At the end of all of this, the drugs still haven’t gotten to the root cause of the problem. The cause of high blood pressure isn’t medication deficiency. The underlying cause is what you eat and how you live.

As we discussed earlier, the ideal blood pressure, defined as the level at which lowering it further yields no additional benefit, is probably around 110/70.96 Can you really get it that low without medication? Remember, this was the average blood pressure of men more than sixty years old in rural Africa on no treatment other than their traditional, plant-based diets and lifestyles.97 In rural China, we find similar results: 110/70 throughout life without any increase with age.98 The reason we suspect that the plant-based nature of their diets is responsible is because, in the Western world, the only group able to routinely achieve these blood pressure readings is vegetarians.99

So do the AHA/ACC/CDC guidelines recommend that people with high blood pressure eat a meat-free diet? No. They recommend the DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, an eating plan specifically designed to lower blood pressure.100 Although it’s been described as a lactovegetarian diet101 (dairy, but no meat or eggs), that isn’t accurate. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, but meat is still present—you’re just supposed to eat less of it.102

Why not recommend an even more plant-based diet? We’ve known for decades that “food of animal origin was highly significantly associated with systolic and diastolic B[lood] P[ressure] after the age and weight effects were removed.”103 That’s a quote from a series of studies performed by renowned physician Frank Sacks and colleagues back in the 1970s, but there are studies going all the way back to the 1920s demonstrating that adding meat to a plant-based diet can significantly elevate blood pressure in a matter of days.104

Why isn’t the DASH diet meatless? Based on the work of Dr. Sacks at Harvard University, the American Heart Association acknowledged that “[s]ome of the lowest B[lood]P[ressure]s observed in industrialized countries have been documented in strict vegetarians.…”105 Were the designers of the DASH diet just not aware of Dr. Sacks’s work? No, the chair of the committee that designed the diet was Dr. Sacks.106

The reason that the DASH diet was modeled explicitly after vegetarian diets but was not meat-free itself might surprise you. The primary design goal of the DASH diet was to explicitly create eating patterns “that would have the blood pressure lowering benefits of a vegetarian diet yet contain enough animal products to make them palatable to nonvegetarians.…”107 Dr. Sacks had even shown that the more dairy vegetarians consumed, the higher their blood pressure appeared to rise.108 But he figured there was no point in calling for a diet he believed few would follow. This is a recurring theme in official dietary recommendations. Instead of simply telling you what the science shows and then letting you make up your own mind, experts patronize the population by advocating what they think is practical rather than ideal. By making the decision for you, they undermine those willing to make even greater changes for optimal health.

The DASH diet does help to bring down blood pressure, but the primary effect seems to arise not from the switch to low-fat dairy and white meat or the reduction in sweets and added fats but from the added fruits and vegetables.109 If the benefits are due to the added plant foods, why not strive to center people’s diets more around these healthiest of foods in the first place?

This question is even more pointed given a 2014 meta-analysis (a compilation of many similar studies) showing that vegetarian diets may be particularly good at lowering blood pressure.110 And the more plants, perhaps, the better. Meat-free diets in general “confer protection against cardiovascular diseases … some cancers and total mortality,” but completely plant-based diets “seem to offer additional protection for obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and cardiovascular mortality.”111

There appears to be a stepwise drop in hypertension rates the more plant-based foods you eat. Based on the same study of eighty-nine thousand Californians featured in chapter 6, compared with people who eat meat more than once a week, flexitarians (those who eat less meat, perhaps a few times a month) had 23 percent lower rates of high blood pressure. Those who cut out all meat except for fish had a 38 percent lower risk of high blood pressure, and those who cut out all meat had a 55 percent lower rate. People who cut out all meat, eggs, and dairy did the best, with a 75 percent reduced risk of high blood pressure. Those eating completely plant-based diets appeared to have thrown three-quarters of their risk for developing this major killer out the window.112

When scientists looked at diabetes and body weight, they found the same apparent progressive improvements as consumption of animal products decreased and plant foods increased. Those eating plant-based diets had just a fraction of the diabetes risk even after factoring out the weight benefits,113 but what about hypertension? On average, those who eat completely plant-based foods are about thirty pounds lighter than those eating conventional diets.114 Maybe they have such great blood pressure just because they’re so much thinner? In other words, do omnivores who are as slim as vegans enjoy the same blood pressure?

To answer this question, researchers would have to find a group of individuals who eat the standard American diet but are also as thin as people eating plant-based diets. To find an omnivorous group that fit and trim, researchers recruited long-distance endurance athletes who had run, on average, forty-eight miles per week for twenty-one years. Running almost two marathons a week for twenty years, pretty much anyone can become as slim as a plant eater no matter what they eat! The researchers then compared these hard-core athletes to two groups: sedentary meat eaters who exercised less than an hour per week and sedentary vegans who ate mostly unprocessed, uncooked plant foods.

How did the numbers come out? Not surprisingly, the endurance runners on a standard American diet had a better blood pressure average than their sedentary, meat-eating counterparts: 122/72 compared with 132/79, which fits the definition of prehypertensive. But the sedentary vegans? They averaged an extraordinary 104/62.115 Apparently, eating standard American fare even when running two thousand miles a year may not bring down your blood pressure as low as a being a couch-potato vegan.

//**********
Foods for Additional Hypertension Protection

A low-sodium diet centered around whole plant foods appears to be the best way to bring down high blood pressure. What if you’re already eating this way but that 110/70 still eludes you? There are a few foods in particular you can try that may offer additional protection.

I’ve already touched on whole grains and will go into detail about flaxseeds, hibiscus tea, and nitrate-rich vegetables. Ground flaxseeds alone “induced one of the most potent blood-pressure-lowering effects ever achieved by a dietary intervention.”116 Eating just a few tablespoons a day appears to be two to three times more powerful than adopting an aerobic endurance exercise program117 (not that you shouldn’t do both—incorporate flaxseeds into your diet and exercise).

Consumption of both raw and cooked vegetables is associated with lower blood pressure, but raw veggies may be slightly more protective.118 Studies have also found that loading up on beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils may help a little,119 so add those to your shopping list. Red wine may help, but only nonalcoholic brands. Only wine that has had the alcohol removed appears to lower blood pressure.120

Watermelon appears to offer protection, which is great (and delicious) news, but you may have to eat about two pounds of it per day to achieve an effect.121 Kiwifruits flopped, though. In a study funded by a kiwifruit company, kiwi failed to offer any protection.122 Perhaps the kiwi industry should take a cue from the California Raisin Marketing Board, which funded a study designed to show that raisins can reduce blood pressure. To inflate the benefits of raisins, they used junk food as the control group. So the study found raisins may lower blood pressure, but only, apparently, compared to fudge cookies, Cheez-Its, and Chips Ahoy!

//***************************************************************
Flaxseed

In chapters 11 and 13, we will see how effective flaxseeds can be against breast and prostate cancers, but you have to be a little skeptical when scientists throw around words like “miraculous” to describe them. (One medical journal published a review titled “Flaxseed: A Miraculous Defense Against Some Critical Maladies.”)124 But a remarkable intervention trial published in the journal Hypertension suggests that in this case, the term “miraculous” may not be too far off.

Rarely does one see a dietary study of this caliber: It was a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. That’s hard to pull off with food. With a drug trial, a blinded study is easy: Researchers give someone a sugar pill that looks identical to the drug, so that neither the study subject nor the person giving the pill knows which one is which (hence, double-blind). But how do you do that with food? People tend to notice if you try to sneak a quarter cup of ground flaxseed into their lunch.

The researchers tried a clever tactic to overcome this problem. They created a number of recipes for common foods including muffins and pasta in which they could disguise placebo ingredients like bran and molasses to match the texture and color of the flax-laden foods. This way, they could randomize people into two groups and secretly introduce tablespoons of daily ground flaxseeds into the diets of half the participants to see if it made any difference.

After six months, those who ate the placebo foods started out hypertensive and stayed hypertensive, despite the fact that many of them were on a variety of blood pressure pills. On average, they started the study at 155/81 and ended it at 158/81. What about the hypertensives who were unknowingly eating flaxseeds every day? Their blood pressure dropped from 158/82 down to 143/75. A seven-point drop in diastolic blood pressure may not sound like a lot, but that would be expected to result in 46 percent fewer strokes and 29 percent less heart disease over time.125

How does that result compare with taking drugs? The flaxseeds managed to drop subjects’ systolic and diastolic blood pressure by up to fifteen and seven points, respectively. Compare that result to the effect of powerful antihypertensive drugs, such as calcium-channel blockers (for example, Norvasc, Cardizem, Procardia), which have been found to reduce blood pressure by only eight and three points, respectively, or to ACE inhibitors (such as Vasotec, Lotensin, Zestril, Altace), which drop patients’ blood pressure by only five and two points, respectively.126 Ground flaxseeds may work two to three times better than these medicines, and they have only good side effects. In addition to their anticancer properties, flaxseeds have been demonstrated in clinical studies to help control cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood sugar levels; reduce inflammation, and successfully treat constipation.


//*********************************
The Power of NO

Nitric oxide (NO) is a key biological messenger within the body, and its message is: “Open Sesame!” When released by your endothelium (the cells lining your arteries), it signals the muscle fibers within the walls of your arteries to relax, allowing them to open up and for more blood to flow. That’s how nitroglycerin pills work: The nitroglycerin people take when they’re experiencing chest pain is converted into NO, which dilates the coronary arteries, allowing more blood to flow to the heart muscle. Erectile dysfunction (ED) pills like Viagra work the same way; they boost nitric oxide signaling, which relaxes penile arteries and improves blood flow to the penis.

The ED you really need to be concerned about, though, is endothelial dysfunction, the failure of the linings of your arteries to produce enough NO to properly dilate them. Nitric oxide is produced by an enzyme called NO synthase. Its enemy is free radicals, which not only gobble up nitric oxide but can hijack NO synthase and force it to start pumping out additional free radicals.142 Without enough NO, your arteries can then stiffen, become dysfunctional, and raise your blood pressure and your risk for heart attack.

So you need to flood your body with antioxidant-rich plant foods throughout the day to extinguish the free radicals and let NO synthase get back to its job of keeping your arteries fully functional. There’s an ultrasound device researchers use to measure the NO-induced dilation of your arteries. One study using this device found that if you take people following a standard Western diet and have them eat even fewer antioxidants, their artery dilation only gets a little bit worse. It seems we’re already near the bottom of the barrel arterial-function-wise, so there’s not much room for further decline. But put people on a high-antioxidant diet by, among many other things, switching their bananas for berries and their white chocolate for dark, and within just two weeks, they experience a significant boost in their arteries’ ability to relax and dilate normally.143

In addition to eating antioxidant-rich foods that can boost your body’s ability to produce NO, you can also eat certain vegetables, such as beets and greens, that are rich in natural nitrates, which your body can convert into nitric oxide. (For the difference between nitrates and nitrites, see chapter 10.) This process explains why researchers have been able to show a ten-point systolic blood pressure drop in volunteers within hours of their consuming beet juice—an effect that lasted throughout the day.144

That study was performed on a group of healthy subjects, though. Obviously, we need to test the power of beets where it counts most—in people with high blood pressure. If nitrate-rich vegetables can so powerfully modulate humanity’s leading risk factor for dying, why did it take until 2015 before such a study was published? Well, who was going to fund it? Big Beet? Drug companies rake in more than $10 billion a year from blood pressure medications.145 You can’t make billions on beets. That’s why we are fortunate to have charities like the British Heart Foundation, which finally funded a beet juice study involving people with high blood pressure.

Half the subjects were provided a cup of beet juice daily for four weeks, while the other half was given an indistinguishable, nitrate-free placebo drink. The researchers found that not only was systolic blood pressure reduced by about eight points in the beet-juice drinkers but the benefits grew week by week, suggesting their blood pressure might have continued to improve even further. The scientists concluded that “nitrate-rich vegetables may prove to be both cost-effective, affordable, and favorable for a public health approach to hypertension.”146

The optimal dose appears to be one-half cup,147 but beet juice is perishable, processed, and hard to find. A typical fifteen-ounce can of beets would provide the same dose of nitrate, but the most concentrated sources of the compound are dark-green, leafy vegetables. The following is a top-ten list of nitrate-rich foods, in ascending order. As you’ll see, eight out of the top ten are greens.

TOP-TEN FOOD SOURCES OF NITRATES

10. Beets

  9. Swiss chard

  8. Oak leaf lettuce

  7. Beet greens

  6. Basil

  5. Mesclun greens

  4. Butter leaf lettuce

  3. Cilantro

  2. Rhubarb

  1. Arugula

Arugula comes out on top with a whopping 480 mg of nitrate per hundred-gram serving, which is more than four times the content of beets.148

The healthiest way to get your nitrate fix is to eat a big salad every day. You could take nitrate- and nitric-oxide-boosting supplements, but they have questionable safety149 and efficacy150 records and should be avoided. What about V8 juice, which boasts both beet and spinach juice? It must not have much, because you’d have to drink nineteen quarts of it a day to reach your daily nitrate intake target.151

The benefits of nitrates may explain why eating your greens is associated with reduced rates of heart disease152 and a longer life span,153 not to mention the “veggie Viagra” effect. You read that right. There’s a link between vegetable consumption and improved sexual function,154 as well as improved blood flow to the most important organ of the body, the brain.155 And the only side effect of beeting your brains out may be a little extra color in your life—namely, red stools and urine that is pretty in pee-nk.

Doping with Beet Juice

A Lamborghini goes faster than a lemon not because the chemistry of gasoline combustion is somehow different in a sports car from that in a beater. It’s because the Lambo has a more powerful engine. Similarly, athletes may have bigger muscles and be able to get more oxygen to those muscles faster. But fundamentally, the amount of energy a body can extract from oxygen remains the same … or so we thought.

About five years ago, one of the gospels of sports physiology got turned on its head—all because of beet juice.

Nitrates, concentrated in green, leafy vegetables and beets, not only help deliver oxygenated blood to your muscles by helping dilate your arteries but also enable your body to extract more energy from that oxygen—something never before thought possible. For example, one little shot of beet juice has been found to allow free divers to hold their breath for a half minute longer than usual.156 After sipping beet juice, cyclists were able to perform at the same level of intensity while consuming 19 percent less oxygen than the placebo group. Then, when they ramped up their bike resistance for an intense bout of what they called “severe cycling,” the time to exhaustion was extended from 9:43 minutes to 11:15 minutes. The beet-juice-drinking group exhibited greater endurance while using less oxygen. In short, the beet juice made the bikers’ bodies’ energy production significantly more efficient. No drug, steroid, supplement, or intervention had ever before been shown to do what beet juice could do.157

This effect works with whole beets too. In another study, men and women eating one and a half cups of baked beets seventy-five minutes before running a 5K race improved their running performance while maintaining the same heart rate and even reported less exertion.158 Faster time with less effort? Them’s some block-rockin’ beets!

To maximize athletic performance, the ideal dose and timing appears to be a half cup of beet juice (or three three-inch beets, or a cup of cooked spinach159) two to three hours before a competition.160

It seems sports news programs are always talking about steroids and other illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Why hasn’t anyone mentioned these mighty and perfectly legit performance-enhancing vegetables? Beets me.

A blood pressure checkup is easy to ignore or postpone. Unlike the case with many of our other leading killers, the insidious consequences of hypertension may not be apparent until you’re lifted into an ambulance or lowered into a grave. So go to your local pharmacy, fire station, or doctor’s office and get your blood pressure checked. If it’s too high, the bad news is that you’ll join the one billion people living with this condition. The good news is that you don’t have to join the millions who die from it every year. Try eating and living healthfully for even just a few weeks, and you may be amazed by the results. Here are just a few stories about people who did just that.

How Not to Die from Liver Diseases

There are some patients you never forget. On the first day of my GI rotation (GI stands for gastrointestinal, which means I was about to come face-to-face with any issues in the digestive tract from mouth to tush), I reported in and was told to go observe my team of senior doctors in one of the endoscopy rooms, where physicians use a scope to look into the GI tract for all manner of routine procedures. I expected to walk into a colonoscopy looking at a rectal polyp or maybe an upper endoscopy looking at a stomach ulcer. But I’ll never forget what I saw. It fuels me to this day in my mission to help people understand the connection between lifestyle and health (or lack of it).

A sedated patient was lying on a gurney, surrounded by a team of doctors using a scope with a camera. I looked at the monitor, trying to find anatomical landmarks to understand where the scope was. It was definitely down the throat, but the esophagus was snaked with what looked like throbbing varicose veins. They were everywhere. They looked like worms trying to emerge from under the smooth surface of the esophagus. Several had eroded through the lining and were spurting blood. I watched as more blood surged out with every one of the patient’s heartbeats. She was basically bleeding to death into her stomach. The doctors tried desperately to cauterize and tie off these fountains of fresh red blood, but it was like a game of Whack-A-Mole. Every time one was cut off, another sprang up.

These were known as esophageal varices—veins swollen with backed-up blood due to a cirrhotic liver. Watching this nightmare unfold, I wondered how the patient first came down with cirrhosis. Was she an alcoholic? Did she contract hepatitis? I remember thinking how devastated she must have felt when she found out she had end-stage liver disease. How was her family coping? I was jerked back from my thoughts by screeching monitor alarms. She was bleeding out.

The doctors couldn’t transfuse blood faster than the patient was losing it internally. Her blood pressure fell, and her heart stopped. The staff jumped into action with chest compressions, paddles delivering shocks, and injections of adrenaline, but within minutes, she was gone.

It was my job to talk to the patient’s family. I learned that her cirrhosis was not due to drinking too much or from being an IV drug user. Her liver had scarred over because she was obese and had developed a fatty liver. Everything I had just witnessed was preventable, a direct result of lifestyle choices. When people are overweight, they can suffer from social stigma, knee problems, and increased risk for metabolic disorders like diabetes, but this was the first person I saw bleed to death before my eyes.

The family cried. I cried. I swore to myself I’d do whatever was necessary to help prevent this from ever happening to anyone under my care.

You can make do with only one kidney. You can survive without a spleen or a gallbladder. You can even get by without a stomach. But you can’t live without a liver, the body’s largest internal organ.

What exactly does the liver do? Up to five hundred different functions have been attributed to this vital organ.1 First and foremost, it plays the role of bouncer, keeping unwanted guests out of your bloodstream. Whatever you absorb through your digestive tract isn’t immediately circulated throughout your body. The blood from your intestines first goes straight to the liver, where nutrients are metabolized and toxins are neutralized. It’s no surprise, then, that what you eat can and does play a critical role in liver health and disease.

About sixty thousand Americans die of liver disease every year, and the death rates have risen each of the last five years.2 The incidence of liver cancer alone has been rising about 4 percent every year over the last decade.3 Liver dysfunction can run in families, like the iron-overload disease hemochromatosis. It can be caused by infections that can lead to liver cancer, or it can stem from drugs—most often inadvertent or intentional overdoses of Tylenol.4 The most common causes, however, are drink and food: alcoholic liver disease and fatty liver disease.

//************************************************************
ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE

According to a famous series of papers in the Journal of the American Medical Association called the “Actual Causes of Death in the United States” [emphasis added], the leading killer of Americans in the year 2000 was tobacco, followed by diet and inactivity. The third-leading killer? Alcohol.5 About half of alcohol-related deaths were due to sudden causes like motor vehicle accidents; the other half were slower, and the leading cause was alcoholic liver disease.6

Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to an accumulation of fat in the liver (what’s known as fatty liver), which can cause inflammation and result in liver scarring and, eventually, liver failure. The CDC defines excessive drinking as the regular consumption of more than one drink a day for women and more than two a day for men. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 8 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces (a “shot”) of hard liquor.7 Progression of the disease can usually be halted by stopping drinking, but sometimes it’s too late.8

Heavy alcohol consumption can cause a fatty liver in less than three weeks,9 but it usually resolves within four to six weeks after stopping drinking.10 But in 5–15 percent of cases, the disease continues to progress, and the liver starts to scar despite alcohol cessation.11

Similarly, once alcohol-induced hepatitis (liver inflammation) is diagnosed, three-year survival rates can be as high as 90 percent among people who stop drinking after diagnosis.12 But as many as 18 percent of them go on to develop cirrhosis, an irreparable scarring of the liver.13

The best strategy to avoid alcoholic liver disease is to not drink so much in the first place. But if you do drink excessively, help is available. Though most people who drink may not be alcoholics,14 there is convincing evidence that twelve-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous can be effective for those who do suffer from alcohol dependence.

Isn’t Moderate Drinking Beneficial?

Everyone agrees that heavy drinking, drinking during pregnancy, and binge drinking are bad ideas, but what about “moderate” drinking? Yes, excessive drinkers appear to significantly shorten their lives, but so can teetotalers.16 While smoking is bad for you and smoking a lot is worse, that logic may not hold for alcohol consumption. There actually appears to be a beneficial effect on overall mortality by drinking some alcohol—but only, it seems, for those who are not taking good care of themselves already.17

Moderate drinking does appear to protect against heart disease, perhaps because of a blood-thinning effect,18 but even light drinking (less than one drink a day) has been found to increase cancer risk, as you’ll see in chapter 11. How could something that increases cancer risk still prolong life? Cancer is “only” our second-leading killer disease. Because heart disease is the leading cause of death, it explains why people who drink moderately may live longer lives than those who abstain. But this advantage may be restricted only to those who fail to practice a bare modicum of healthy behaviors.19

To find out who might benefit from moderate alcohol consumption, researchers recruited close to ten thousand men and women and followed them for seventeen years after assessing their drinking and lifestyle habits. The results were published in a paper entitled “Who Benefits Most from the Cardioprotective Properties of Alcohol Consumption—Health Freaks or Couch Potatoes?” What constituted a “health freak”? According to the researchers’ definition, anyone who exercises thirty minutes a day, doesn’t smoke, and eats at least one serving of fruits or vegetables daily.20 (What does that say about our current diets if eating a single apple means you’re a “health freak”?)

One to two drinks a day did lower the risk of heart disease for the “couch potatoes,” those living unhealthy lifestyles. But people who practiced even the bare minimum of healthy behaviors showed no benefit from alcohol. The lesson: Grapes, barley, and potatoes are best eaten in their nondistilled form, and Johnnie Walker is no substitute for actual walking.

//***************************************************************************
NONALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE

The most common cause of a fatty liver is not alcohol but nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). You may remember the blockbuster documentary Super Size Me, in which the film’s director, Morgan Spurlock, ate exclusively at McDonald’s for a month. Predictably, Spurlock’s weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol all went up—but so did his liver enzymes. That was a sign that his liver cells were dying and spilling their contents into his bloodstream. How was his diet causing liver damage? Let’s put it this way: He was beginning to turn his liver into human foie gras (fatty liver pâté).

Some critics wrote off the film as overly sensational, but researchers in Sweden took it seriously enough to formally replicate Spurlock’s one-man experiment. In their study, a group of men and women agreed to eat two fast-food meals a day. At the start, their liver enzyme levels were normal, but after just one week of this diet, more than 75 percent of the volunteers’ liver function test results became pathological.21 If an unhealthy diet can cause liver damage within just seven days, it should be no surprise that NAFLD has quietly become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, afflicting an estimated seventy million people.22 That’s about one in three adults. Nearly 100 percent of those with severe obesity may be affected.23

Like alcoholic fatty liver, NAFLD starts with a buildup of fat deposits in the liver that cause no symptoms. In rare cases, this can progress to inflammation and, over years, end up scarring the liver into a state of cirrhosis, resulting in liver cancer, liver failure, and even death—as I saw in that endoscopy suite.24

Fast food is so effective at instigating the disease because NAFLD is associated with the intake of soft drinks and meat. Drinking just one can of soda a day appears to raise the odds of getting fatty liver disease by 45 percent.25 Meanwhile, those who eat the meat equivalent of fourteen chicken nuggets or more daily have nearly triple the rate of fatty liver disease compared to people who eat seven nuggets’ worth or less.26

NAFLD has been characterized as a “tale of fat and sugar,”27 but not all fat affects the liver similarly. People suffering from fatty liver inflammation were found to be consuming more animal fat (and cholesterol) but less plant fat (and fiber and antioxidants).28 This may explain why adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans has been associated with less severe fatty liver disease even though it is not typically a low-fat diet.29

NAFLD may also be caused by cholesterol overload.30 The dietary cholesterol found in eggs, meat, and dairy can become oxidized and then set off a chain reaction that results in excess fat in the liver.31 When the concentration of cholesterol in your liver cells gets too high, it can crystallize like rock candy and result in inflammation. This process is similar to the way uric acid crystals cause gout (as we’ll see in chapter 10).32 Your white blood cells try to engulf the cholesterol crystals but then die in the process, spilling out inflammatory compounds. This may explain how benign fatty liver cases can turn into serious hepatitis.33

To explore the relationship between diet and serious liver disease, about nine thousand American adults were studied for thirteen years. The researchers noted that their most important finding may be that cholesterol consumption was a strong predictor of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Those consuming the amount of cholesterol found in two Egg McMuffins34 or more each day appeared to double their risk of hospitalization or death.35

Your best bet for avoiding NAFLD, the most common cause of liver disease, may be to avoid excess calories, cholesterol, saturated fat, and sugar.


//
VIRAL HEPATITIS

Another common cause of liver disease is viral hepatitis, which is triggered by one or more of five different viruses: hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E. The mode of transmission and prognosis differs for each of these viruses. Hepatitis A is spread primarily through food or water that is tainted with contaminated feces. It can be prevented through vaccination, avoiding raw and undercooked shellfish, and trying to ensure that everyone who handles your food washes their hands after changing diapers or using the toilet.

While hepatitis A virus is foodborne, hepatitis B virus is bloodborne and is transmitted sexually. As with hepatitis A, an effective vaccine is available against hepatitis B that every child should get. Hepatitis D virus infection can only occur in someone who is already infected with hepatitis B and so can be prevented by preventing hepatitis B. So get vaccinated and refrain from intravenous drug use and unsafe sex.

Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine for the hepatitis C virus, the most dreaded of liver viruses. Exposure can lead to a chronic infection that, over decades, can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Hepatitis C is now the leading cause of liver transplants.36

Chlorella and Hepatitis C

The green algae chlorella looks promising for the treatment of hepatitis C. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that about two teaspoons a day of chlorella boosted the activity of natural killer cells in participants’ bodies, which can naturally kill hepatitis C-infected cells.37 A clinical study of hepatitis-C patients found that chlorella supplementation may lower the level of liver inflammation, but the study was small and uncontrolled.38

There is a desperate need for alternative treatments for hepatitis C, as older, less expensive therapies frequently fail due to their unbearable side effects, whereas newer, more tolerable drugs cost as much as $1,000 per pill.39 Chlorella may help as an adjunct (additional) therapy or for those who can’t tolerate or afford conventional antiviral therapy but may not be without risk (see here).

Hepatitis C is transmitted via blood, usually through sharing needles rather than via blood transfusions, now that the blood supply is screened for the virus. However, sharing personal-care items that can be contaminated with trace amounts of blood, such as toothbrushes and razors, may also present a risk.40

Although a case was once reported involving a woman who contracted hepatitis C from sharing a supermarket meat slicer with an infected coworker,41 the virus would not naturally be present in the meat itself, as humans and chimpanzees are the only animals who appear susceptible to it.

The same cannot be said for hepatitis E virus.

Preventing Hepatitis E Through Diet

As one of the CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis laboratory chiefs explained in a paper entitled “Much Meat, Much Malady: Changing Perceptions of the Epidemiology of Hepatitis E,” hepatitis E virus is now considered a zoonotic disease, able to spread from animals to humans, and pigs may be the primary viral reservoir.42

The shift in thinking began in 2003, when researchers in Japan linked the hepatitis E virus (HEV) with the consumption of grilled pork liver. After testing pig livers from Japanese grocery stores, the researchers determined that nearly 2 percent of the meat tested positive for HEV.43 In the United States, it was even worse: 11 percent of commercial pig livers purchased from grocery stores were contaminated with HEV.44

That’s alarming, but how many people really eat pig livers? What about plain old pork?

Unfortunately, pork may harbor HEV as well. Experts suspect that much of the American population has been exposed to this virus, as there is known to be a relatively high prevalence of HEV antibodies among U.S. blood donors. This exposure may be a result of individuals consuming HEV-contaminated pork.45

So do more people die of liver disease in countries where pork is more popular? It appears so. The relationship between national per capita pork consumption and deaths from liver disease correlates as tightly as per capita alcohol consumption and liver fatalities. Each pork chop consumed per capita may be associated with about two beers’ worth of increased liver mortality risk on a countrywide scale.46

Aren’t viruses deactivated by cooking? Usually, but there’s always the problem of cross-contaminating your hands or kitchen surfaces while handling raw meat. Once meat is in the oven, most foodborne pathogens can be destroyed by cooking the meat to proper internal cooking temperatures, with an emphasis on proper. Researchers at the National Institute of Health subjected the hepatitis E virus to various levels of heat and found that HEV can survive the internal temperature of meat cooked rare.47 So if you cook pork, invest in a meat thermometer and make sure to follow proper handling techniques, including washing kitchen surfaces with a bleach solution.48

Though most people who develop hepatitis E recover completely, it can be deadly for pregnant women: The risk of death during the third trimester can reach as high as 30 percent.49 If you are pregnant, please be especially careful about pork preparation. And if there are people in the household who like their pork pink in the middle, they should be sure to wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom.

//****************************** Stick to real food **********************************************
Weight-Loss Supplements and Liver Disease

We’ve all seen those marketing schemes involving products espousing all sorts of health claims. And given the pyramid-like multilevel structure of those types of distribution programs—you earn money by selling products and also for recruiting others to sell—word can spread pretty fast, which is particularly troubling when PR outruns the truth.

Indeed, while the vast majority of drug-induced liver injuries are caused by conventional medications, liver damage caused by certain classes of dietary supplements can be even more serious and may lead to higher rates of liver transplants and death.50 Multilevel marketers of products later linked to toxic reactions (such as noni juice51 and Herbalife52) have pointed to scientific studies to support their health claims. However, a public health review found that such studies often seemed “deliberately created for marketing purposes” and were presented in such a way as to appear “designed to mislead potential consumers.” Often, multilevel marketing study researchers didn’t disclose their funding sources, but a little detective work can expose a web of financial conflicts of interest.53

These suspect studies were the same ones cited to provide proof of safety for their products. For example, a multilevel marketing company that sells mangosteen juice cited a study they paid for to support its assertion that their product is “safe for everyone.” The study involved exposing just thirty people to their product with another ten people given a placebo. With so few people tested, the stuff could literally kill 1 or 2 percent of users and you wouldn’t know.54

A study that the multilevel marketing company behind a supplement called Metabolife cited for safety placed thirty-five people on the stuff.55 Metabolife has since been withdrawn from the market after being linked to heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and deaths.56 Hydroxycitric acid, a component of such products as Hydroxycut, was studied on forty people.57 No serious adverse effects were found, but the story ended the same way: Hydroxycut was withdrawn after dozens of verified cases of organ damage were brought to light—including massive liver failure requiring transplantation and even death.58 Until the multibillion-dollar herbal supplement industry is better regulated, you’re better off saving your money—and your health—by sticking to real food.


//***************************
PROTECTING THE LIVER AT BREAKFAST

Specific plant foods have been found to be protective of the liver. For instance, starting out the day with a bowl of oatmeal and (surprisingly) coffee may help safeguard our liver function.

Oatmeal

In numerous population studies, consumption of whole grains has been associated with reduced risk for a range of chronic diseases,59 but it’s hard to tease out whether eating whole grains may just be a marker for a healthier lifestyle in general. For example, people who eat whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat, and brown rice, also tend to be more physically active, smoke less, and eat more fruits, vegetables, and dietary fiber60 than those who might prefer a breakfast of Froot Loops, for example. No wonder the former group may have lower disease risk. Fortunately, researchers can control for these factors, effectively comparing nonsmokers only to nonsmokers with similar diet and exercise habits. When that’s done, whole grains still appear to be protective.61

In other words, the evidence seems clear that oatmeal eaters may have lower rates of disease, but that’s not the same as showing that if you start eating more oatmeal, your risk will drop. To prove cause and effect, we need to put it to the test by performing an interventional trial: Change people’s diets and see what happens. Ideally, researchers would randomly split people into two groups and give half of them oatmeal and the other half a placebo—a fake, similar-tasting and -looking oatmeal. Neither the study subjects nor the researchers themselves can know who’s in which group until the end. This robust, double-blind method is easy to use when studying drugs, as you just give people a sugar pill that looks like the drug in question. As we’ve discussed, it’s not as easy to make placebo food.

But in 2013, a group of researchers published the first double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oatmeal in overweight men and women.62 They found a significant reduction in liver inflammation in the real oatmeal group, but that may have been because they lost so much more weight than the controls (that is, the placebo-oatmeal eaters). Nearly 90 percent of the real-oatmeal-treated subjects had lost weight, compared with no weight loss, on average, among the control group. So it may be that the benefits of whole grains on liver function are indirect.63 A follow-up study in 2014 helped confirm the findings of a protective role for whole grains in nonalcoholic fatty liver patients in reducing the risk of liver inflammation. In this study, refined grain consumption was associated with increased risk of the disease.64 So lay off the Wonder Bread and stick to truly wonderful whole-grain foods, including oatmeal.

Making Your Own Whole-Cranberry Cocktail

A specific class of plant compounds called anthocyanins—the purple, red, and blue pigments in such plants as berries, grapes, plums, red cabbage, and red onions—have been found to prevent fat accumulation in human liver cells in in vitro studies.65 A single confirmatory clinical (human) trial has been published in which a purple sweet potato concoction successfully dampened liver inflammation better than a placebo.66

When it came to suppressing the growth of human liver cancer cells in a petri dish,67 cranberries beat out the other most common fruits in the United States: apples, bananas, grapefruits, grapes, lemons, oranges, peaches, pears, pineapples, and strawberries. Other studies have found that cranberries are also effective in vitro against additional cancers, including those of the brain,68 breast,69 colon,70 lung,71 mouth,72 ovary,73 prostate,74 and stomach.75 Unfortunately, there have yet to be clinical studies of the effects of cranberries on cancer patients that confirm these findings.

Moreover, to the drug industry’s chagrin, scientists have been unable to pin down the active ingredients involved in cranberries’ special effects. Extracts concentrating individual components fail to match the anticancer effects of the cranberry as a whole,76 which of course can’t be patented. More proof that it’s nearly always best to give preference to whole foods.

How do you do that with cranberries, though, since they’re so tart?

It’s not easy at the grocery store. Ninety-five percent of cranberries are sold in the form of processed products, such as juices and sauces.77 In fact, to get the same amount of anthocyanins found in a single cup of fresh or frozen cranberries, you’d have to drink sixteen cups of cranberry juice cocktail, eat seven cups of dried cranberries, or make your way through twenty-six cans of cranberry sauce.78 The ruby-red phytonutrient found in cranberries is a powerful antioxidant, but the high-fructose corn syrup added to cranberry cocktail acts as a pro-oxidant, canceling out some of the benefit.79

Here’s a simple recipe for a whole-food version of a tasty cranberry beverage, what I call my Pink Juice:

 

1 handful fresh or frozen cranberries

2 cups water

8 teaspoons erythritol (a naturally derived low-calorie sweetener; read more about erythritol and other sweeteners in part 2)

Place all the ingredients in a blender and blend at high speed. Pour over ice and serve.

 

At just twelve calories, this recipe has twenty-five times fewer calories and at least eight times more phytonutrients than typical cranberry juice drinks.80

For an extra boost, blend in some fresh mint leaves. You’ll get a weird-looking green foam on top, but not only will it taste good, you’ll be happy to know that you’re chugging down berries and dark, leafy greens, two of the healthiest foods on the planet. Bottoms up!

Liver cancers are among the most avoidable cancers, through hepatitis B vaccination, control of hepatitis C transmission, and reduction of alcohol consumption. These three measures could, in principle, wipe out 90 percent of liver cancers worldwide. It remains unclear whether coffee drinking has an additional role to play, but such a role would be limited compared with preventing liver damage in the first place.

With liver disease, as always, prevention is the key. All the most serious liver conditions—liver cancer, liver failure, and cirrhosis—can start with an inflamed liver. That inflammation can be caused by an infection or the buildup of fatty deposits. Liver viruses can be prevented by common-sense measures. Don’t inject drugs, do get vaccinated, and do practice safe sex. Liver fat can also be prevented by common sense measures: Avoid excess consumption of alcohol, calories, cholesterol, saturated fat, and sugar.

FOODS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED RISK OF BLOOD CANCERS

After following more than sixty thousand people for more than a dozen years, University of Oxford researchers found that those who consume a plant-based diet are less likely to develop all forms of cancer combined. The greatest protection appeared to be against blood cancers. The incidence of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma among those eating vegetarian diets is nearly half that of those eating meat.6 Why is this greatly reduced risk of blood cancers associated with a more plant-based diet? The British Journal of Cancer concluded, “More research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this.”7 While they are figuring out the reasons, why not get a head start and try adding more healthy plant foods to your plates today?

Greens and Cancer

The key to cancer prevention and treatment is to keep tumor cells from multiplying out of control while allowing healthy cells to grow normally. Chemotherapy and radiation can do a great job of wiping out cancer cells, but healthy cells can get caught in the crossfire. Some compounds in plants, though, may be more discriminating.

For instance, sulforaphane, considered one of the more active components in cruciferous vegetables, kills human leukemia cells in a petri dish while having little impact on the growth of normal cells.8 As we’ve discussed, cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, but there are many others in this family, such as collard greens, watercress, bok choy, kohlrabi, rutabaga, turnips, arugula, radishes (including horseradish), wasabi, and all types of cabbage.

It’s intriguing that dripping cabbage compounds on cancer cells affects them in a laboratory, but what really matters is whether people with blood cancers who eat lots of vegetables actually live longer than those who don’t. For about eight years, Yale University researchers followed more than five hundred women with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Those who started out eating three or more servings of vegetables daily had a 42 percent improved survival rate over those who ate less. Green, leafy vegetables, including salad and cooked greens, and citrus fruits appeared most protective.9 It’s not clear, though, whether the survival benefit arose from helping to keep the cancer at bay or from improving patients’ tolerance to the chemotherapy and radiation treatments they were receiving. The accompanying editorial in the journal Leukemia & Lymphoma suggested that a “lymphoma diagnosis may be an important ‘teachable’ moment to improve diet.…”10 I would suggest you not wait until a cancer diagnosis to clean up your diet.

The Iowa Women’s Health Study, which has followed more than thirty-five thousand women for decades, found that higher broccoli and other cruciferous vegetable intake was associated with lower risk of getting non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the first place.11 Likewise, a study at the Mayo Clinic found that those who ate about five or more servings of green, leafy vegetables a week had roughly half the odds of getting lymphoma compared with those who ate less than one serving a week.12

******************************* dietary intake, not supplementary intake **************

								NO ANTIOIXIDANT SUPPLEMENTS 
Some of the plant-based protection might have been due to the antioxidant properties of fruits and vegetables. Higher dietary intake of antioxidants is associated with significantly lower lymphoma risk. Note I said dietary intake, not supplementary intake. Antioxidant supplements don’t appear to work.13 For example, getting lots of vitamin C in your diet is associated with lower lymphoma risk, but taking in even more vitamin C in pill form did not seem to help. The same was found for carotenoid antioxidants like beta-carotene.14 Apparently, pills do not have the same cancer-fighting effects as produce.

When it comes to certain other cancers, like those of the digestive tract, antioxidant supplements may even make things worse. Combinations of antioxidants like vitamin A, vitamin E, and beta-carotene in pill form were associated with increased risk of death in those who took them.15 Supplements contain only a select few antioxidants, whereas your body relies on hundreds of them, all working synergistically to create a network to help the body dispose of free radicals. High doses of a single antioxidant may upset this delicate balance and may actually diminish your body’s ability to fight cancer.16

When you buy antioxidant supplements, you may be doling out money to live a shorter life. Save your cash and your health by eating the real thing: food.

*************************** antioxidants
In terms of antioxidant bang for your buck, açai berries get honorable mention, beating out other superstars, such as walnuts, apples, and cranberries. The bronze for best bargain, though, goes to cloves, the silver to cinnamon, and the gold for most antioxidants per dollar—according to a USDA database of common foods—goes to purple cabbage.24 Açai berries, however, would probably make a tastier smoothie.

**********************************
Curcumin and Multiple Myeloma

As noted, multiple myeloma is one of the most dreaded cancers. It is practically incurable even with aggressive medical treatment. As myeloma cells take over the bone marrow, healthy white blood cells continue to decline in number, which increases your susceptibility to infection. Reduced levels of red blood cells can lead to anemia, and reduced platelet counts can lead to serious bleeding. Once diagnosed, most people survive fewer than five years.25

Multiple myeloma does not occur out of the blue. It appears to be nearly always preceded by a precancerous condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, or MGUS.26 When scientists first discovered MGUS, it was aptly named because, at that time, the significance of finding elevated levels of abnormal antibodies in someone’s body was unclear. We now know it’s a precursor to multiple myeloma, and about 3 percent of Caucasians over age fifty have it,27 while the rate among African Americans may be double.28

MGUS causes no symptoms. You won’t even know you have it unless your doctor finds it incidentally during routine blood work. The chance of MGUS progressing into myeloma is about 1 percent per year, which means many MGUS-stricken people may die of other causes before they develop myeloma.29 However, since multiple myeloma is basically a death sentence, scientists have been desperate to find ways to stop MGUS in its tracks.

Given the safety and efficacy of the turmeric spice component curcumin against other types of cancer cells, researchers from the University of Texas collected multiple myeloma cells and put them in a petri dish. Without any intervention, the cancer cells quadrupled within a few days—that’s how fast this cancer can grow. But when a little curcumin was added to the broth they were bathing in, the myeloma cells’ growth was either stunted or stopped altogether.30

As we’ve discovered, stopping cancer in a laboratory is one thing. What about in people? In 2009, a pilot study found that half (five out of ten) of the subjects with MGUS who had particularly high abnormal antibody levels responded positively to curcumin supplements. None (zero out of nine) of those given a placebo experienced a similar drop in antibody levels.31 Buoyed by this success, scientists conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and achieved similarly encouraging results in both patients with MGUS and those with “smoldering” multiple myeloma, an early stage of the disease.32 This result suggests that a simple spice found in the grocery store might have the ability to slow or stop this horrific cancer in a certain percentage of patients, though we won’t know more until longer studies are performed to see if these hopeful changes in blood-work biomarkers translate into changes in actual patient outcomes. In the meantime, it couldn’t hurt to spice up your diet.


//************************************************
ARE ANIMAL VIRUSES INVOLVED IN HUMAN BLOOD CANCERS?

The reason people eating plant-based diets appear to have much lower rates of blood cancers33 may be due to the foods they’re choosing to eat and/or choosing to avoid. To tease out the role different animal products might play in the myriad blood cancers, we would need to conduct a very large study. Enter the aptly named EPIC study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which did just that. As we saw in chapter 4, researchers recruited more than four hundred thousand men and women across ten countries and followed them for about nine years. If you recall, regular chicken consumption was associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer. Similar findings were found for blood cancers. Of all the animal products studied (including unusual categories, such as offal, or entrails and organs), poultry tended to be associated with the greatest increased risk of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, all grades of follicular lymphoma, and B-cell lymphomas, such as B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (including small lymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytic lymphocytic leukemia).34 The EPIC study found that risk increased between 56 percent and 280 percent for every 50 grams of poultry consumed daily. For comparison, a cooked, boneless chicken breast may weigh as much as 384 grams.35

Why is there so much lymphoma and leukemia risk associated with eating such relatively small amounts of poultry? The researchers suggested this result could be a fluke, or it could be due to the drugs, such as antibiotics, that are often fed to chickens and turkeys to promote their growth. Or it might be the dioxins found in some poultry meat, which have been linked to lymphoma.36 But dairy can also contain dioxins, and milk consumption was not linked to NHL. The researchers surmised it may be the cancer-causing viruses in poultry, given that lower risk of NHL has been associated with eating meat cooked well done instead of rare (thereby inactivating any viruses).37 This suggestion is consistent with the results of the NIH-AARP study (see here), which found an association between eating just-done chicken and one type of lymphoma and lower risk of another blood cancer tied to greater exposure to the cooked meat carcinogen MeIQx.38

How could less cancer be linked to more carcinogen exposure? MeIQx is one of the heterocyclic amines created by cooking meat at high temperatures, such as baking, broiling, and frying.39 If, in the case of blood cancers, one cause is a poultry virus, then the more the meat was cooked, the more likely it is that the virus was destroyed. Cancer-causing poultry viruses—including the avian herpesvirus that causes Marek’s disease, several retroviruses like reticuloendotheliosis virus, the avian leukosis virus found in chickens, and the lymphoproliferative disease virus found in turkeys—may explain the higher rates of blood cancers among farmers,40 slaughterhouse workers,41 and butchers.42 Viruses can cause cancer by directly inserting a cancer-causing gene into a host’s DNA.43

Animal viruses can infect people who prepare meat with unpleasant skin diseases, such as contagious pustular dermatitis.44 There’s even a well-defined medical condition commonly known as “butchers’ warts” that affects the hands of those who handle fresh meat, including poultry and fish.45 Even the wives of butchers appear to be at higher risk for cervical cancer, a cancer definitively associated with wart-virus exposure.46

Workers in poultry slaughterhouses have been found to have higher rates of cancers of the mouth, nasal cavities, throat, esophagus, rectum, liver, and blood. On a public health level, the concern here is that the cancer-causing viruses present in poultry and poultry products may then be transmitted to those in the general population who handle or eat inadequately cooked chicken.47 These results were replicated recently in the largest such investigation to date, studying more than twenty thousand workers in poultry slaughtering and processing plants. They confirmed the findings of three other studies to date: Workers in these facilities do have increased risk of dying from certain cancers, including cancers of the blood.48

Researchers are finally starting to connect the dots. The high levels of antibodies to avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses49 and to reticuloendotheliosis viruses50 recently found in poultry workers provide evidence of human exposure to these cancer-causing poultry viruses. Even line workers who simply cut up the finished product and weren’t ever exposed to live birds had elevated levels of antibodies in their blood.51 Beyond just occupational safety, the potential threat to the public, the researchers concluded, “is not trivial.”52

Elevated blood cancer rates can even be traced back to the farm. An analysis of more than one hundred thousand death certificates found that those who grew up on a farm raising animals appeared significantly more likely to develop a blood cancer later in life, whereas growing up on a farm growing only crops was not. Worst was growing up on a poultry farm, which was associated with nearly three times the odds of developing blood cancer.53

Exposure to cattle and pigs has also been associated with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.54 A 2003 study by University of California researchers revealed that nearly three-quarters of human subjects tested positive for exposure to the bovine leukemia virus, likely through the consumption of meat and dairy products.55 Approximately 85 percent of U.S. dairy herds have tested positive for the virus (and 100 percent on industrial-scale operations).56

However, just because people are exposed to a virus that causes cancer in cows does not mean that humans themselves can become actively infected with it. In 2014, researchers supported in part by the U.S. Army Breast Cancer Research Program published a remarkable report in a journal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They reported that the bovine leukemia virus DNA was found to be incorporated into normal and cancerous human breast tissue, effectively proving that people can also become infected with this cancer-causing animal virus.57 To date, however, the role poultry and other farm animal viruses play in the development of human cancers remains unknown.

What about the feline leukemia virus? Thankfully, pet companionship is associated with lower rates of lymphoma, which is a personal relief given how many animals I’ve shared my life with. And the longer people have had cats or dogs in their lives, the lower their risk. In one study, the lowest risk of lymphoma was found in people who had had pets for twenty years or longer. The researchers suspect the reason is connected to the fact that having pets may have beneficial effects on the immune system.

How Not to Die from Kidney Disease

Letters and e-mails from patients never fail to inspire me. One note that came to mind as I was writing this chapter was from Dan, a retired NFL player. I first met him when he was forty-two. Even at that relatively young age, the former professional athlete was already taking three separate blood pressure medications. Still, his blood pressure was elevated. He was a little overweight, maybe by twenty-five pounds. He and his significant other waited around after one of my talks to see me.

Dan’s physician had just told him that his kidneys were starting to show signs of damage due to his blood pressure. The first thing I asked was if he was taking his meds as prescribed, since many people skip their blood pressure medications because of their unpleasant side effects. Yes, he assured me, he was. He showed me a checklist he carried around to keep track of his meds. He asked me what supplements he could add to the list to help his kidneys.

I told him that no matter what he might have seen on the Internet, there’s no such magic pill, but if he filled up his plate with lots of whole, healthy foods each day, the damage might be stopped or even reversed. Well, Dan took this advice to heart (and to kidney!), and he allowed me to share his e-mail:

Well, I went home that night and we cleaned house. Got rid of everything that didn’t grow out of the ground, everything processed. And guess what, over the next year, I lost my beer belly and the high blood pressure. Life is so much better without those medications—they made me feel so tired all the time. And my kidney function is back to normal. It makes me mad that no one told me this sooner and that I had to feel so bad before I felt better.

It’s easy to take your kidneys for granted, but they work around the clock, like a high-tech, nonstop water filter for your blood. They process up to 150 quarts of blood every twenty-four hours just to make the 1–2 quarts of urine you pee out each day.

If your kidneys do not function properly, metabolic waste products can accumulate in the blood and eventually lead to such symptoms as weakness, shortness of breath, confusion, and abnormal heart rhythms. Most people with deteriorating kidney function, however, don’t experience any symptoms at all. If your kidneys fail completely, you will either need a new one (i.e., need a kidney transplant) or have to go on dialysis, a process by which a machine artificially filters the blood. But kidney donors are in short supply, and the average life expectancy of a person on dialysis is less than three years.1 It’s better to keep your kidneys healthy in the first place.

Although your kidneys can fail suddenly in response to certain toxins, infections, or urinary blockage, most kidney disease is characterized by a gradual loss of function over time. A national survey found that only 41 percent of Americans tested had normal kidney function, a drop from 52 percent about a decade earlier.2 Approximately one in three Americans over the age of sixty-four may suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD),3 though three-quarters of the millions affected may not even know they have it.4 More than half of American adults currently aged thirty to sixty-four are expected to develop chronic kidney disease during their lifetimes.5

Why, then, aren’t millions of people on dialysis? Because kidney malfunction can be so damaging to the rest of the body that most people don’t live long enough to reach that stage. In a study in which more than a thousand Americans over age sixty-four with CKD were followed for a decade, only one in twenty developed end-stage kidney failure. Most of the others had already died, with cardiovascular disease killing more than all other causes combined.6 That’s because our kidneys are so critical to proper heart function that patients under age forty-five with kidney failure can be a hundred times more likely to die of heart disease than those with working kidneys.7

The good news? The diets that are healthiest for our hearts—those centered around unprocessed plant foods—may be the best way to prevent and treat kidney disease as well.

//******************************************************
Damaging Your Kidneys with Diet

Kidneys are highly vascular organs, meaning they’re packed with blood vessels, which is why they look so red. We’ve already seen that the standard American diet can be toxic to blood vessels in the heart and the brain—so what might it be doing to the kidneys?

Putting that question to the test, researchers at Harvard University followed thousands of healthy women, their diets, and their kidney function for more than a decade8 to look for the presence of protein in the women’s urine. Healthy kidneys work hard to retain protein and other vital nutrients, preferably filtering toxic or useless wastes out of the bloodstream via our urine. If the kidneys are leaking protein into urine, it’s a sign that they may be starting to fail.

The researchers found three specific dietary components associated with this sign of declining kidney function: animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol. Each of these is found in only one place: animal products. The researchers found no association between kidney function decline and the intake of protein or fat from plant sources.9

One hundred and fifty years ago, Rudolf Virchow, the father of modern pathology, first described fatty degeneration of the kidney.10 This concept of lipid nephrotoxicity, or the idea that fat and cholesterol in the bloodstream could be toxic to the kidneys, has since been formalized,11 based in part on studies that found plugs of fat clogging up the works in autopsied kidneys.12

The link between cholesterol and kidney disease has gained such momentum in the medical community that cholesterol-lowering statin drugs have been recommended to slow its progression.13 But wouldn’t it be better (not to mention safer and cheaper) to treat the underlying cause of the disease by eating healthier?


//******************************************************************************
Which Type of Protein Is Better for Our Kidneys?

In the two decades between 1990 and 2010, the leading causes of death and disability remained relatively constant. As noted in chapter 1, heart disease is still the leading cause of loss of health and life. Some diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, have slid down the list, but among the diseases whose incidence has increased the most over the past generation is chronic kidney disease. The number of deaths has doubled.14

This has been blamed on our “meat-sweet” diet.15 Excess table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup consumption is associated with increased blood pressure and uric acid levels, both of which can damage the kidney. The saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol found in animal products and junk food are also associated with impaired kidney function, and meat protein increases the acid load to the kidneys, boosting ammonia production and potentially damaging our sensitive kidney cells.16 This is why a restriction of protein intake is often recommended to chronic kidney disease patients to help prevent further functional decline.17

But all protein isn’t created equal. It’s important to understand that not all protein has the same effect on your kidneys.

High animal protein intake can have a profound influence on normal human kidney function by inducing a state called hyperfiltration, a dramatic increase in the workload of the kidney. Hyperfiltration isn’t harmful if it occurs only occasionally. We all have built-in reserve kidney function—so much so that people can live with only one kidney. The human body is thought to have evolved the capacity to handle intermittent large doses of protein from our remote hunting and scavenging days. But now many of us are ingesting large doses of animal protein day after day, forcing our kidneys to call on their reserves continuously. Over time, this unrelenting stress may explain why kidney function tends to decline as people age, predisposing even otherwise healthy people to progressive deterioration of kidney function.18

The reason those who eat a plant-based diet appear to have better kidney function was originally thought to be due to their lower overall protein intake.19 However, we now know that it’s more likely due to the fact that the kidneys appear to handle plant protein very differently from animal protein.20

Within hours of consuming meat, your kidneys rev up into hyperfiltration mode. This is true of a variety of animal proteins—beef, chicken, and fish appear to have similar effects.21 But an equivalent amount of plant protein causes virtually no noticeable stress on the kidneys.22 Eat some tuna, and within three hours, your kidney filtration rate can shoot up 36 percent. But eating the same amount of protein in the form of tofu doesn’t appear to place any additional strain on the kidneys.23

Could substituting plant protein for animal protein help slow the deterioration of kidney function? Yes, half a dozen clinical trials have shown that plant protein replacement can reduce hyperfiltration and/or protein leakage,24,25,26,27,28,29 but all these studies were short term, lasting fewer than eight weeks. It wasn’t until 2014 that a six-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed examining how the kidneys process soy protein versus dairy protein. Consistent with the other studies, plant protein was found to help preserve function in ailing kidneys.30

Why does animal protein cause the overload reaction while plant protein doesn’t? Because of the inflammation animal products can cause. Researchers discovered that after giving study subjects a powerful anti-inflammatory drug along with animal protein, the hyperfiltration response and protein spillage disappeared.


//******************************************************
Reducing Dietary Acid Load

Another reason animal protein may be so detrimental to kidney function is that it is generally more acid forming. This is because animal protein tends to have higher levels of sulfur-containing amino acids, such as methionine, which produce sulfuric acid when metabolized in the body. Fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, are generally base forming, which helps neutralize acids in our kidneys.32

Dietary acid load is determined by the balance of acid-inducing foods (such as meats, eggs, and cheese) and base-inducing foods (such as fruits and vegetables). A 2014 analysis of the diets and kidney function of more than twelve thousand Americans across the country found that a higher dietary acid load was associated with significantly higher risk of protein leakage into the urine, an indicator of kidney damage.33

Ancient human diets largely consisted of plants, so they likely produced more base than acid in the kidneys of our ancestors. Humans evolved eating these alkaline (base-forming) diets over millions of years. Most contemporary diets, on the other hand, produce acid in excess. This switch from base- to acid-forming diets may help explain our modern epidemic of kidney disease.34 Acid-inducing diets are believed to impact the kidney through “tubular toxicity,” damage to the tiny, delicate, urine-making tubes in the kidneys. To buffer the excess acid formed by your diet, kidneys produce ammonia, which is a base and can neutralize some of that acid. Counteracting the acid is beneficial in the short term, but over the long run, all the extra ammonia in the kidneys may have a toxic effect.35 The decline in kidney function over time may be a consequence of a lifetime of ammonia overproduction.36 Kidneys may start to deteriorate in your twenties,37 and by the time you reach your eighties, you may be down to half capacity.38

The chronic, low-grade, metabolic acidosis attributed to a meat-rich diet39 helps explain why people eating plant-based diets appear to have superior kidney function40 and why various plant-based diets have been so successful in treating chronic kidney failure.41,42 Under normal circumstances, a vegetarian diet alkalinizes the kidneys, whereas a nonvegetarian diet carries an acid load. This proved to be true even among vegetarians who consumed processed meat substitutes, such as veggie burgers.43

If people are unwilling to reduce their meat consumption, they should be encouraged to eat more fruits and vegetables to balance out that acid load.44 “However,” one kidney doctor editorialized, “many patients find it difficult to follow a diet high in fruits and vegetables and might therefore be more adherent to a supplement.”45

So what did researchers try? Giving people baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) pills. Instead of treating the primary cause of the excess acid formation (too many animal products and too few fruits and vegetables), they preferred to treat the consequences. Too much acid? Here’s some base to neutralize it. Sodium bicarbonate can effectively buffer the acid load,46 but, rather obviously, sodium bicarbonate contains sodium, which over the long term may itself contribute to kidney damage.47

Unfortunately, this type of Band-Aid approach is all too typical of today’s medical model. Cholesterol too high from eating a diet unnaturally high in saturated fat and cholesterol? Take a statin drug to cripple your cholesterol-making enzyme. Diet unnaturally high in acid-forming foods? Swallow some baking soda pills to balance that right out.

These same researchers also tried giving people fruits and vegetables instead of baking soda and found that they offered similar protections, with the additional advantage of lowering the subjects’ blood pressure. The title of the accompanying commentary in the medical journal was telling: “The Key to Halting Progression of CKD Might Be in the Produce Market, Not in the Pharmacy.”

//
Bottom line: When urine is more alkaline, stones are less likely to form. This helps explain why less meat and more fruits and vegetables appear so protective. The standard American diet yields acidic urine. When people are placed on a plant-based diet, however, their urine can be alkalinized up to a near neutral pH in less than a week.63

Not all plant foods are alkalinizing, though, and not all animal foods are equally acidifying. The LAKE (Load of Acid to Kidney Evaluation) score takes into account both the acid load of foods and their typical serving sizes in order to help people modify their diets for the prevention of kidney stones and other acid-related diseases, such as gout. As you can see in figure 4, the single most acid-producing food was fish, including tuna, followed by pork, poultry, cheese, and beef. Eggs are actually more acid producing than beef, but people tend to eat fewer of them at one sitting. Some grains can be a little acid forming, such as bread and rice, but not pasta, interestingly. Beans are significantly acid reducing, but not as much as fruits are, with vegetables crowned the most alkaline forming of foods.


//***************************************
Kidney Stones

Eating a plant-based diet to alkalinize your urine may also help prevent and treat kidney stones—those hard mineral deposits that can form in your kidneys when the concentration of certain stone-forming substances in your urine becomes so high they start to crystallize. Eventually, these crystals can grow into pebble-sized rocks that block the flow of urine, causing severe pain that tends to radiate from one side of the lower back toward the groin. Kidney stones can pass naturally (and often painfully), but some become so large that they have to be removed surgically.

The incidence of kidney stones has increased dramatically since World War II49 and even just in the last fifteen years. Approximately one in eleven Americans are affected today, compared with one in twenty less than two decades ago.50 What accounts for this rising incidence? The first clue to an answer came in 1979 when scientists reported a striking relationship between the prevalence of kidney stones since the 1950s and increasing consumption of animal protein.51 As in all observational studies, though, the researchers couldn’t prove cause and effect, so they decided to perform an interventional trial: They asked the subjects to add extra animal protein to their daily diets, the equivalent of about an extra can’s worth of tuna fish. Within two days of eating the extra tuna, the levels of stone-forming compounds—calcium, oxalate, and uric acid—shot up such that the subjects’ kidney-stone risk increased 250 percent.52

Note the experimental “high” animal protein diet was designed to re-create the animal protein intake of the average American,53 suggesting that Americans could considerably lower their risk of kidney stones by lowering their meat intake.

By the 1970s, enough evidence had accumulated that researchers began to ask whether people suffering from recurrent kidney stones should stop eating meat altogether.54 A study on the kidney stone risk of vegetarians wasn’t published until 2014, though. Oxford University researchers found that subjects who didn’t eat meat at all had a significantly lower risk of being hospitalized for kidney stones, and for those who did eat meat, the more they ate, the higher their associated risk.55

Is some meat worse than others? People who form kidney stones are commonly advised to restrict their intake of red meat, but what about chicken or fish? We didn’t know until another 2014 study compared salmon and cod to chicken breasts and burgers. It found that gram for gram, fish might be slightly worse than other meat in terms of the risk of certain kidney stones, but they concluded that overall, “[s]tone formers should be counseled to limit the intake of all animal proteins.”56

Most kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate, which forms like rock candy when urine becomes supersaturated with calcium and oxalates. For many years, doctors assumed that because the stones are made of calcium, they should counsel their patients to simply reduce their calcium intake.57 As with so much in medicine, clinical practice often flies blind without solid experimental support. This changed with a landmark study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which pitted the traditional, low-calcium diet against a diet low in animal protein and sodium. After five years, the study found that eating less meat and salt was about twice as effective as the conventionally prescribed low-calcium diet, cutting kidney-stone risk by half.58

What about cutting down on oxalates, which are concentrated in certain vegetables? Reassuringly, a recent study found there was no increased risk of stone formation with higher vegetable intake. In fact, greater intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a reduced risk independent of other known risk factors, meaning there may be additional benefits to bulking up on plant foods above and beyond restricting animal foods.59

Another reason a reduction in animal protein is helpful is that it lowers uric acid buildup, which can form crystals that seed calcium stones or form stones all by itself. Indeed, uric acid stones are the second most common type of kidney stones. So it makes sense that to reduce your risk, you should try to reduce excess uric acid production. This can be accomplished either of two ways: by adding drugs or by subtracting meat.60 Uric acid–blocking medications like allopurinol may be effective, but they can have serious side effects.61 On the other hand, removing all meat from a standard Western diet appears to reduce the risk of uric acid crystallization by more than 90 percent within as few as five days.62

Bottom line: When urine is more alkaline, stones are less likely to form. This helps explain why less meat and more fruits and vegetables appear so protective. The standard American diet yields acidic urine. When people are placed on a plant-based diet, however, their urine can be alkalinized up to a near neutral pH in less than a week.63

Not all plant foods are alkalinizing, though, and not all animal foods are equally acidifying. The LAKE (Load of Acid to Kidney Evaluation) score takes into account both the acid load of foods and their typical serving sizes in order to help people modify their diets for the prevention of kidney stones and other acid-related diseases, such as gout. As you can see in figure 4, the single most acid-producing food was fish, including tuna, followed by pork, poultry, cheese, and beef. Eggs are actually more acid producing than beef, but people tend to eat fewer of them at one sitting. Some grains can be a little acid forming, such as bread and rice, but not pasta, interestingly. Beans are significantly acid reducing, but not as much as fruits are, with vegetables crowned the most alkaline forming of foods.

Dietary changes can be so powerful they can not only help prevent kidney stones but also, in some cases, cure them without drugs or surgery. Uric acid stones can apparently be dissolved away completely with a combination of eating more fruits and vegetables, restricting animal protein and salt intake, and drinking at least ten glasses of fluid a day.

Preventing Excess Phosphorus Intake

Having too much phosphorus in the blood may increase the risk of kidney failure, heart failure, heart attacks, and premature death. Excess phosphorus also appears to damage our blood vessels and accelerate aging and bone loss.69 As such, elevated levels appear to be an independent risk factor for early death among the general population.70

Phosphorus is found in a variety of plant and animal foods. Most Americans consume about twice as much phosphorus as they need,71 but it’s not just about how much you eat but how much you absorb. By switching to a plant-based diet, you can achieve a significant drop in your blood phosphorus levels even as your intake levels of the mineral remains constant.72 This occurs because the phosphorus in animal foods appears in the form of a compound called phosphate, which is absorbed into the bloodstream more readily than phytate, the predominant form of phosphorus in plant foods.73 As you may remember from chapter 4, this situation is similar to the case of iron, another essential mineral of which you can get too much. Your body can better protect itself from absorbing too much plant-based iron, but it can’t as effectively stop surplus muscle or blood-based (heme) iron from slipping through the intestinal wall.

The worst type of phosphorus, though, is that found in phosphate food additives. These phosphorus compounds are added to cola drinks and meat to enhance their color.74 (Without added phosphate, Coca-Cola would be pitch black.75) Less than half of most plant phosphorus76 and about three-quarters of natural animal product phosphorus gets into your bloodstream,77 but added phosphate can be absorbed at a rate of nearly 100 percent.78

Phosphate additives play an especially important role in the meat industry. Chicken meat is often injected with phosphates to improve its color, to add water weight (and thus to increase profitability since chicken can be sold by the pound), and to reduce “purge,” the term used to describe the liquid that seeps from meat as it ages.79 The problem with this additive is that it can nearly double the phosphorous levels in meat.80 Phosphate additives have been described as “a real and insidious danger” for kidney patients, since they have diminished capacity to excrete it,81 but given what we now know about excess phosphorus, it’s a concern for us all.

In the United States, eleven different types of phosphate salts are allowed to be injected into raw meat and poultry,82 a practice that’s long been banned in Europe.83 This is because phosphates found in meat and processed foods are considered “vascular toxins,”84 capable of impairing our arterial function within hours of consuming a high-phosphate meal.85 In meat, there’s an additional food safety concern, as adding phosphate may increase the growth of leading food poisoning bacteria Campylobacter in poultry purge up to a millionfold.86

It’s easy to avoid added phosphorus in processed foods—just don’t buy anything containing ingredients with the word “phosphate” in their names, including pyrophosphate and sodium triphosphate.87 With meat, it’s more difficult to determine the phosphate content, as producers aren’t required to disclose injected additives. Added phosphate may be labeled as “flavorings” or “broth” or not labeled at all.88 Meat already contains highly absorbable phosphates; adding more may just add insult to kidney injury. Chicken appears to be the worst offender: A supermarket survey found more than 90 percent of chicken products contained phosphate additives.

Who Determines Whether Food Additives Are Safe?

In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finally announced its plans to all but eliminate trans fats from processed foods,90 citing a CDC estimate that as many as twenty thousand heart attacks each year could be prevented by eliminating partially hydrogenated oils.91 Until June 16, 2015, trans fats enjoyed so-called GRAS status: “generally recognized as safe.”

Why were these killer fats deemed safe in the first place?

Guess who makes the “generally recognized as safe” determination? It’s not the government or a scientific body. It’s the manufacturer. You read that right. The food maker gets to determine whether or not its own product is safe for the public, a process the FDA refers to as “GRAS self-determination.” What’s more, these manufacturers can legally add things to our food supply without informing the FDA.92 An estimated one thousand food-additive safety decisions have never even been reported to the FDA or the public.93

But sometimes food manufacturers do notify the FDA when they introduce a new additive. Sounds responsible of them, doesn’t it? Presumably they found some independent, third-party panel to evaluate the safety of their product so as to avoid a financial conflict of interest, right?

Well, not exactly.

Of all the GRAS safety determinations that were voluntarily submitted to the FDA between 1997 and 2012, 22.4 percent were made by someone directly employed by the manufacturer itself, 13.3 percent were made by someone directly employed by a firm handpicked by the manufacturer, and 64.3 percent were made by a panel either handpicked by the manufacturer or chosen by a firm hired by the manufacturer.94 Are you doing the math? Yes, zero food safety decisions were made independently.

How could regulators let companies decide for themselves whether the food additives they use in their own products are safe? Follow the money. Three of Washington’s largest lobbying firms reportedly now work for the food industry.95 For example, PepsiCo alone spent more than $9 million in a single year to lobby Congress.96 The deeper you dig, the less surprising it is that such food additives as trans fats have been allowed to kill thousands year after year.

But hey, according to the manufacturer, they’re safe …

//******************************************
Can Diet Protect Against Kidney Cancer?

Each year, sixty-four thousand Americans are diagnosed with kidney cancer, and about fourteen thousand die from it.97 Approximately 4 percent of these cases are hereditary,98 but what about the other 96 percent?

Historically, the only accepted risk factor for kidney cancer has been tobacco use.99 A class of carcinogens in cigarette smoke called nitrosamines are considered to be so harmful that even so-called thirdhand smoke is a concern. The risks of tobacco smoke do not end when a cigarette is extinguished, as residual smoke can stick to walls and other surfaces.100 Around 80 percent of nitrosamines from cigarette smoke can remain in a room, even with normal ventilation,101 so always try to choose smoke-free hotel rooms. Nitrosamines are one of the reasons you can’t smoke indoors without endangering others, even if you smoke without anyone present. As one of the leading scholars in the tobacco control movement recently wrote, “Carcinogens of this strength in any other consumer product designed for human consumption would be banned immediately.”102

Except for one: meat.

Did you know that one hot dog has as many nitrosamines (and nitrosamides, which are similar tobacco carcinogens103) as four cigarettes and that these carcinogens are also found in fresh meat, including beef, chicken, and pork?104 This may help explain the rising rates of kidney cancer over the last few decades despite the falling rates of smoking.

//*******************************************************
Clearing the Confusion: Nitrates, Nitrites, Nitrosamides and Nitrosamines

Although fresh meat also contains nitrosamines, processed or cured meat like deli slices may be particularly harmful. In Europe, the world’s second-largest prospective study on diet and cancer calculated that a reduction in processed meat consumption to less than twenty grams a day—less than a small matchbook-sized portion—would prevent more than 3 percent of all deaths.105 In the largest such investigation the NIH-AARP study of more than five hundred thousand Americans (see here) found the preventable fraction of deaths may be even higher. The researchers suggested, for example, that 20 percent of heart disease deaths among American women could be averted if the highest consumers of processed meat would cut down to the equivalent of less than a half strip of bacon a day.106 No wonder the American Institute for Cancer Research recommends that you simply “avoid processed meat such as ham, bacon, salami, hot dogs and sausages.”107

Nitrites are added to cured meat as a “color fixative” and to help prevent the growth of botulism bacteria (a rare but serious paralytic illness).108 What about “uncured” bacon? It says right on the package: “No nitrites or nitrates added.” But study the fine print and you may see a little footnote that reads something like “except those naturally occurring in celery juice.” Vegetables do contain nitrates that can be fermented into nitrites, so adding fermented celery juice to bacon is just a sneaky way of adding nitrites. Even commentators in the journal Meat Science have realized this may be perceived by consumers as “incorrect at best or deceptive at worst.”109

But the same fermentation that converts nitrates to nitrites can happen when you eat vegetables, thanks to bacteria on your tongue. So why are vegetable nitrates and nitrites okay but the same compounds from meat are linked to cancer?110 Because nitrites themselves are not carcinogenic; they turn into carcinogens. Nitrites only become harmful when they turn into nitrosamines and nitrosamides. For them to do that, amines and amides must be present, and amines and amides are found in abundance in animal products. This transformation can happen in the meat itself or in your stomach after you eat it. In the case of plant foods, the vitamin C and other antioxidants that are found naturally in them block the formation of these carcinogens in your body.111 This process would explain why intake of both nitrate and nitrite from processed meat has been linked to kidney cancer, but no increased risk was found for nitrate or nitrite intake from plant sources.112

While nitrite from animal sources—not just processed meats—was associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer, some of the highest nitrate-containing vegetables, such as arugula, kale, and collards, are associated with significantly reduced risk for kidney cancer.113

Kidneys are tasked with the monumental responsibility of filtering your blood all day, every day. That’s a lot of work for two fist-sized organs. Kidneys are extremely resilient, but they aren’t indestructible. When they begin to fail, the body can start failing too. Toxic substances that healthy kidneys would ordinarily filter out can pass through and build up in the bloodstream.

To keep your kidneys strong and your blood clean, you must carefully consider what you eat. The meat-sweet American diet can slowly damage your kidneys one meal at a time, forcing the kidneys into a state of hyperfiltration. Imagine how long your car engine would last if you always revved it near the red line? Thankfully, medical science has proven that you can reduce your kidneys’ workload (and acid load) by moving toward a more plant-based diet.

CHAPTER 11

How Not to Die from Breast Cancer

“You have breast cancer.”

These are among the most feared words a woman can hear, and for a good reason. Besides skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women. Every year, about 230,000 are diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,000 die from it.1

Breast cancer does not occur overnight. That lump you feel in the shower one morning may have started forming decades ago. By the time doctors detect the tumor, it may have been present for forty years or even longer.2 The cancer has been growing, maturing, and acquiring hundreds of new survival-of-the-fittest mutations that allow it to grow even more quickly as it tries to outmaneuver your immune system.

The scary reality is that what doctors call “early detection” is actually late detection. Modern imaging simply isn’t good enough to detect cancer at its earliest stages, so it can spread long before it’s even spotted. A woman is considered “healthy” until she shows signs or symptoms of breast cancer. But if she has been harboring a malignancy for two decades, can she truly be considered healthy?

People who are doing the right thing by improving their diets in hopes of preventing cancer may in fact be successfully treating it as well. Autopsy studies have shown that as many as 20 percent of women aged twenty to fifty-four who died from unrelated causes, such as car accidents, had so-called “occult” (or hidden) breast cancers growing inside them.3 Sometimes there’s nothing you can do to prevent the initiation stage of cancer, when that first normal breast cell mutates into a cancerous one. Some breast cancers may even start in the womb and be related to your mother’s diet.4 For this reason, we all need to choose a diet and lifestyle that not only prevents the initiation stage of cancer but also hampers the promotion stage, during which the cancer grows to a size large enough to pose a threat.

The good news is that no matter what your mom ate or how you lived as a child, by eating and living healthfully, you may be able to slow the growth rate of any hidden cancers. In short, you can die with your tumors rather than from them. This is how dietary cancer prevention and treatment can end up being the same thing.

One or two cancer cells never hurt anyone. But how about a billion cancer cells? That’s how many may be in a tumor5 by the time it’s picked up by a mammogram.6 Like most tumors, breast cancer starts with just one cell, which divides to become two, four, and then eight. Every time breast cancer cells divide, the tumor can effectively double in size.7

Let’s see how many times a tiny tumor has to double to get to a billion cells. Take out a calculator. Multiply one times two. Then multiply that number by two. Keep doing that until you reach one billion. Don’t worry. It won’t take long. It’s only thirty doublings. In just thirty doublings, a single cancer cell can turn into a billion.

The key to how quickly you’d be diagnosed with cancer, then, is the doubling time. How long does it take tumors to double once? Breast cancers can double in size in anywhere from as few as twenty-five days8 to a thousand days or more.9 In other words, it could be two years, or it could be more than a hundred years, before a tumor starts to cause problems.

Where you fall on that timescale—two years or a century—may depend in part on what you eat.

When I was teen, I ate a lousy diet. One of my favorite meals was—no joke—chicken-fried steak. During my youth, I may have caused one of the cells in my colon or prostate to mutate. But I’ve been eating much healthier for the last twenty-five years. My hope is that even if I did initiate a cancerous growth, if I don’t promote it, I may be able to slow down its growth. I don’t care if I get diagnosed with cancer a hundred years from now. I don’t expect to be around at that point to worry about it.

Current controversy over the cost and effectiveness of mammograms10 misses an important point: Breast cancer screening, by definition, does not prevent breast cancer. It can just pick up existing breast cancer. Based on autopsy studies, as many as 39 percent of women in their forties already have breast cancers growing within their bodies that may be simply too small to be detected by mammograms.11 That’s why you can’t just wait until diagnosis to start eating and living healthier. You should start tonight.


//****************************** IGF-1 ****************************************
RISK FACTORS FOR BREAST CANCER

The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) is considered one of the world’s leading authorities on diet and cancer. Based on the best available research, it came up with ten recommendations for cancer prevention.12 Beyond never chewing tobacco, their bottom-line dietary message was: “Diets that revolve around whole plant foods—vegetables, whole grains, fruits and beans—cut the risk of many cancers, and other diseases as well.”13

To demonstrate how dramatically lifestyle choices can impact breast cancer risk, over the course of about seven years, researchers followed a group of about thirty thousand postmenopausal women with no history of breast cancer. Achieving just three of the ten AICR recommendations—limiting alcohol, eating mostly plant foods, and maintaining a normal body weight—was associated with a 62 percent lower risk of breast cancer.14 Yes, three simple health behaviors appeared to cut risk by more than half.

Remarkably, eating a plant-based diet along with walking every day can improve our cancer defenses within just two weeks. Researchers dripped the blood of women before and after fourteen days of healthy living onto breast cancer cells growing in petri dishes. The blood taken after they started eating healthier suppressed cancer growth significantly better and killed 20–30 percent more cancer cells than the blood taken from the same women just two weeks before.15 The researchers attributed this effect to a decrease in levels of a cancer-promoting growth hormone called IGF-1,16 likely due to the reduced intake of animal protein.17

What kind of blood do you want in your body—what kind of immune system? The kind of blood that just rolls over when new cancer cells pop up, or blood that circulates to every nook and cranny in your body with the power to slow down and stop cancer cells in their tracks?


//**********************************************************
Alcohol

In 2010, the official World Health Organization body that assesses cancer risks formally upgraded its classification of alcohol to a definitive human breast carcinogen.18 In 2014, it clarified its position by stating that, regarding breast cancer, no amount of alcohol is safe.19

But what about drinking “responsibly”? In 2013, scientists published a compilation of more than one hundred studies on breast cancer and light drinking (up to one alcoholic beverage a day). The researchers had found a small but statistically significant increase in breast cancer risk even among women who had at most one drink per day (except, perhaps, for red wine—see box below). They estimated that, every year around the world, nearly five thousand breast cancer deaths may be attributable to light drinking.20

The carcinogen isn’t alcohol itself. The culprit is actually the toxic breakdown product of alcohol called acetaldehyde, which can form in your mouth almost immediately after you take a sip. Experiments show that even holding a single teaspoon of hard liquor in your mouth for five seconds before spitting it out results in the production of potentially carcinogenic levels of acetaldehyde that lingers for more than ten minutes.21

If even a single sip of alcohol might produce cancer-causing levels of acetaldehyde in the mouth, what about using mouthwash that contains alcohol? Researchers who tested the effects of a variety of retail mouthwashes and oral rinses concluded that, although the risk is slight, it is probably best to refrain from using such products if they contain alcohol.


Red Wine Versus White Wine

The Harvard Nurses’ Health Study found that even less than one drink a day may be associated with a small increase in breast cancer risk.23 Interestingly, drinking only red wine was not associated with breast cancer risk. Why? A compound in red wine appears to suppress the activity of an enzyme called estrogen synthase, which breast tumors can use to create estrogen to fuel their own growth.24 This compound is found in the skin of the dark-purple grapes used to make red wine, which explains why white wine appears to provide no such benefit,25 since it’s produced without the skin.

The researchers concluded that red wine may “ameliorate the elevated breast cancer risk associated with alcohol intake.”26 In other words, the grapes in red wine may help cancel out some of the cancer-causing effects of the alcohol. But you can reap the benefits without the risks associated with imbibing alcoholic beverages by simply drinking grape juice or, even better, eating the purple grapes themselves—preferably ones with seeds, as they appear to be most effective at suppressing estrogen synthase.27

It’s good (and delicious) to know that strawberries,28 pomegranates,29 and plain white mushrooms30 may also suppress the potentially cancer-promoting enzyme.


//
Melatonin and Breast Cancer Risk

For billions of years, life on planet Earth evolved under conditions of about twelve hours of light and twelve hours of darkness. Humans controlled fire for cooking about a million years ago, but we’ve only been using candles for about five thousand years and electric lights for a mere century. In other words, our ancient ancestors lived half their lives in the dark.

These days, though, because of the electric-light pollution at night, the only Milky Way your children may see is inside a candy wrapper. Electric lighting has enabled us to remain productive well into the wee hours, but might this unnatural nighttime light exposure have any adverse health effects?

In philosophy, there’s a flawed argument called the appeal-to-nature fallacy, in which someone proposes that something is good merely because it’s natural. In biology, however, this may hold some truth. The conditions under which our bodies were finely tuned over millions of years can sometimes give us insight into our optimal functioning. For example, we evolved running around naked in equatorial Africa. Therefore, it’s not surprising that many of us modern humans become deficient in vitamin D (the “sunshine vitamin”) if we live in Northern climes or in countries where the culture dictates full-body coverings for women.31

Could something as ubiquitous as the lightbulb be a mixed blessing? Right in the middle of your brain sits the pineal gland, your so-called third eye. It’s connected to your actual eyes and has just one function: to produce a hormone called melatonin. During the day, the pineal gland is inactive. But once the sky darkens, it activates and begins pumping melatonin into your bloodstream. You start getting tired, feel less alert, and start thinking about sleep. Melatonin secretion may peak between 2:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M. and then shuts off at daybreak, which is your cue to wake up. The level of melatonin in your bloodstream is one of the ways your internal organs know what time it is. It functions as one hand on your circadian clock.32

Besides helping to regulate your sleep, melatonin is thought to play another role—suppressing cancer growth. Think of melatonin as helping to put cancer cells to sleep at night.33 To see if this function applies to preventing breast cancer, researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and elsewhere came up with the clever idea of studying blind women. The thought was that because blind women can’t see sunlight, their pineal glands never stop secreting melatonin into their bloodstreams. Sure enough, the researchers found that blind women may have just half the odds of breast cancer as sighted women.34

Conversely, women who interrupt their melatonin production by working night shifts appear to be at increased risk for breast cancer.35 Even living on a particularly brightly lit street may affect the risk. Studies comparing nighttime satellite photos against breast cancer rates have found that people living in brighter neighborhoods tend to have a higher breast cancer risk.36,37,38 Therefore, it’s probably best to sleep without any lights on and with the blinds down, though the evidence to support these strategies is limited.39

Melatonin production can be gauged by measuring the amount of melatonin excreted in our first pee in the morning. And, indeed, women with higher melatonin secretion have been found to have lower rates of breast cancer.40 Other than minimizing nighttime light exposure, is there anything else you can do to keep up your production of melatonin? Apparently so. In 2005, Japanese researchers reported an association between higher vegetable intake and higher melatonin levels in the urine.41 Is there anything in your diet that may lower melatonin production, thereby potentially increasing breast cancer risk? We didn’t know until a comprehensive study of diet and melatonin was published in 2009. Researchers at Harvard University asked nearly a thousand women about their consumption of thirty-eight different foods or food groups and measured their morning melatonin levels. Meat consumption was the only food significantly associated with lower melatonin production, for reasons that are yet unknown.42

Minimizing melatonin disruption may therefore mean putting curtains on your windows, eating more vegetables, and lowering the curtain on eating too much meat.


//
Exercise and Breast Cancer

Physical activity is considered a promising preventive measure against breast cancer43 not only because it helps with weight control but because exercise tends to lower circulating estrogen levels.44 Five hours a week of vigorous aerobic exercise can lower estrogen and progesterone exposure by about 20 percent.45 But do you need to work out that long for it to be protective?

Although even light exercise is associated with lowered risk of some other types of cancer, for breast cancer, leisurely strolls don’t appear to cut it.46 Even an hour a day of activities such as slow dancing or light housework may not help.47 According to the largest study ever published on the subject, only women who worked up a sweat at least five or more times a week appeared to get significant protection.48 Moderately intense activity may offer as much benefit as vigorous exercise, though.49 Walking at a moderate pace for an hour a day is considered a moderately intense level of exercise, but it wasn’t put to the test until a 2013 study reported that, indeed, walking an hour a day or more is associated with significantly lower breast cancer risk.50

Darwin was right: It’s survival of the fittest—so get fit!



//**************************************************************
Heterocyclic Amines

In 1939, a curious finding was published in a paper titled “Presence of Cancer-Producing Substances in Roasted Food.” A researcher described how he could induce breast cancers in mice by painting their heads with extracts of roasted horse muscle.51 These “cancer-producing substances” have since been identified as heterocyclic amines (HCAs), described by the National Cancer Institute as “chemicals formed when muscle meat, including beef, pork, fish, and poultry, is cooked using high-temperature methods.”52 These cooking methods include roasting, pan frying, grilling, and baking. Eating boiled meat is probably the safest. People who eat meat that never goes above 212 degrees Fahrenheit produce urine and feces that are significantly less DNA-damaging compared to those eating meat dry-cooked at higher temperatures.53 This means they have fewer mutagenic substances flowing through their bloodstreams and coming in contact with their colons. On the other hand, baking chicken for as few as fifteen minutes at about 350 degrees Fahrenheit leads to HCA production.54

These carcinogens are formed in a high-temperature chemical reaction between some of the components of muscle tissue. (The lack of some of these substances in plants may explain why even fried veggie burgers don’t contain measurable HCAs.)55 The longer meat is cooked, the more HCAs form. This process may explain why eating well-done meat is associated with increased risk of cancers of the breast, colon, esophagus, lung, pancreas, prostate, and stomach.56 The situation creates what the Harvard Health Letter called a meat preparation “paradox”57: Cooking meat thoroughly reduces the risk of contracting foodborne infections (see chapter 5), but cooking meat too thoroughly may increase the risk of foodborne carcinogens.

Just because heterocyclic amines cause cancer in rodents doesn’t mean they cause cancer in humans. In this case, though—it turns out people may be even more susceptible. The livers of rodents have shown an uncanny ability to detoxify 99 percent of the HCAs scientists stuffed down the animals’ throats (a technique known as gavage).58 But then, in 2008, researchers discovered that the livers of humans fed cooked chicken were only able to detoxify about half of these carcinogens, suggesting that the cancer risk is far higher than was previously thought based on experiments in rats.59

The carcinogens found in cooked meat are thought to explain why, as the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported in 2007, women who eat more grilled, barbecued, or smoked meats over their lifetimes may have as much as 47 percent higher odds of breast cancer.60 And the Iowa Women’s Health Study found that women who ate their bacon, beefsteak, and burgers “very well done” had nearly five times the odds of getting breast cancer compared with women who preferred these meats served rare or medium.61

To see what was happening inside the breast, researchers asked women undergoing breast-reduction surgery about their meat-cooking methods. The scientists were able to link the consumption of fried meat with the amount of DNA damage found within the women’s breast tissue,62 the type of damage that can potentially cause a normal cell to mutate into a cancer cell.63

HCAs appear able both to initiate and to promote cancer growth. PhIP, one of the most abundant HCAs in cooked meat, was found to have potent estrogen-like effects, fueling human breast-cancer cell growth almost as powerfully as pure estrogen,64 on which most human breast tumors thrive. But that result was based on research in a petri dish. How do we know that cooked-meat carcinogens find their way into human breast ducts, where most breast cancers arise? We didn’t, until researchers measured the levels of PhIP in the breast milk of nonsmoking women. (HCAs are also found in cigarette smoke.)65 In this study, PhIP was found in the breast milk of women who ate meat at the same concentration known to significantly boost breast cancer cell growth.66 No trace of PhIP was found in the breast milk of the one vegetarian participant.67

A similar finding was reported in a study comparing the levels of PhIP in people’s hair. The chemical was detected in hair samples of all six of the meat eaters tested, but in only one of the six vegetarians.68 (HCAs can also be found in fried eggs.)69

Your body can rapidly rid itself of these toxins once exposure ceases. In fact, urine levels of PhIP can drop to zero within twenty-four hours of refraining from eating meat.70 So if you practice Meatless Mondays, the level of PhIP passing through your body may become undetectable by Tuesday morning. But diet is not the only source of PhIP. HCA levels in vegetarians who smoke may approach those of nonsmoking meat eaters.71

The heterocyclic amine PhIP is not just a so-called complete carcinogen, able to both initiate cancers and then promote their growth. PhIP may also then facilitate cancer spread. Cancer develops in three major stages: 1) initiation, the irreversible DNA damage that starts the process; 2) promotion, the growth and division of the initiated cell into a tumor; and 3) progression, which can involve the invasion of the tumor into surrounding tissue and metastasis (spread) to other areas of the body.

Scientists can test how invasive, or aggressive, a certain cancer is by putting its cells into an instrument called an invasion chamber. They place cancer cells on one side of a porous membrane and then gauge their ability to penetrate and spread through the membrane. When researchers placed metastatic breast cancer cells from a fifty-four-year-old woman in an invasion chamber all by themselves, relatively few were able to breach the barrier. But within seventy-two hours of adding PhIP to the chamber, the cancer cells became more invasive, crawling through the membrane at an accelerated rate.72

PhIP in meat may therefore represent a three-strikes-you’re-out type of carcinogen, potentially involved in every stage of breast cancer development. Staying away from the stuff isn’t easy, though, eating the standard American diet. As the researchers note: “Exposure to PhIP is difficult to avoid because of its presence in many commonly consumed cooked meats, particularly chicken, beef and fish.”


//******************************************************
Cholesterol

Remember earlier when we discussed the American Institute for Cancer Research? A study found that following its guidelines for cancer prevention appeared to reduce not just breast cancer risk but also heart disease risk.74 What’s more, not only may eating healthier to prevent cancer help to prevent heart disease but eating to prevent heart disease may also help to prevent cancer. One of the reasons? Cholesterol may play a role in the development and progression of breast cancer.75

Cancer appears to feed on cholesterol. LDL cholesterol stimulates the growth of breast cancer cells in a petri dish—they just gobble up the so-called bad cholesterol. Tumors may suck up so much cholesterol that cancer patients’ cholesterol levels tend to plummet as their cancer grows.76 This is not a good sign, as patient survival tends to be lowest when cholesterol uptake is highest.77 The cancer is thought to be using the cholesterol to make estrogen or to shore up tumor membranes to help the cancer migrate and invade more tissue.78 In other words, breast tumors may take advantage of high circulating cholesterol levels to fuel and accelerate their own growth.79 Cancer’s hunger for cholesterol is such that pharmaceutical companies have considered using LDL cholesterol as a Trojan horse to deliver antitumor drugs to cancer cells.80

Though data have been mixed, the largest study on cholesterol and cancer to date—including more than a million participants—found a 17 percent increased risk in women who had total cholesterol levels over 240 compared with women whose cholesterol was under 160.81 If lowering cholesterol may help lower breast cancer risk, what about taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs?

Statins looked promising in petri-dish studies, but population studies comparing breast cancer rates among statin users and nonusers showed inconsistent results. Some suggested statins decreased breast cancer risk, while others showed increased risk. Nearly all these studies were relatively short term, however. Most considered five years to be long-term statin use, but breast cancer can take decades to develop.82

The first major study on the breast cancer risk of statin use for ten years or longer was published in 2013. It found that women who had been taking statins for a decade or more had twice the risk of both common types of infiltrating breast cancer: invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma.83 The cholesterol drugs doubled the risk. If confirmed, the public health implications of these findings are immense: Approximately one in four women in the United States over the age of forty-five may be taking these drugs.84

The number-one killer of women is heart disease, not breast cancer, so women still need to bring down their cholesterol. You can likely achieve this without drugs by eating a healthy enough plant-based diet. And certain plant foods may be particularly protective.

PREVENTING (AND TREATING) BREAST CANCER BY EATING PLANTS

Not long ago, I received a very moving note from Bettina, a woman who had been following my work on NutritionFacts.org. Bettina had been diagnosed with stage two “triple-negative” breast cancer—the hardest type to treat. She underwent eight months of treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. A breast cancer diagnosis is stressful enough, but the anxiety and depression can be compounded by this type of rigorous cancer regimen.

Bettina, however, used the experience to make positive changes in her life. After watching a number of my videos, she started to eat healthier. She followed many of the recommendations you’ll find in this chapter for helping to prevent a recurrence of cancer, such as eating more broccoli and flaxseeds. The good news: Bettina has been cancer-free for more than three years now.

Given all the studies I read through, it’s easy for me to forget that the statistics refer to people’s lives. Stories like Bettina’s help me put faces to all the dry facts and figures. When real people make real changes, they can see real results.

Sadly, even after a breast cancer diagnosis, most women may not make the dietary changes that could help them most, such as consuming less meat and more fruits and vegetables.85 Maybe they don’t realize (or their doctors never told them) that a healthier lifestyle may improve their survival chances. For example, a study of nearly 1,500 women found that remarkably simple behavior changes—such as eating just five or more servings of fruits and veggies per day along with walking for thirty minutes six days a week—were associated with a significant survival advantage. Those who followed these recommendations appeared to have nearly half the risk of dying from their cancer in the two years following diagnosis.86

While stories like Bettina’s can help make the statistics more inspiring, it all has to come back to the science. Over time, what to eat and feed our families are life-or-death decisions. How else can we decide but based on the best available balance of evidence?

//
Fiber

Inadequate fiber consumption may also be a risk factor for breast cancer. Researchers at Yale University and elsewhere found that premenopausal women who ate more than about six grams of soluble fiber a day (the equivalent of about a single cup of black beans) had 62 percent lower odds of breast cancer compared with women who consumed less than around four grams a day. Fiber’s benefits appeared even more pronounced for estrogen-receptor-negative breast tumors, which are harder to treat: Premenopausal women on a higher fiber diet had 85 percent lower odds of that type of breast cancer.87

How did the researchers arrive at these figures? The Yale study was what’s called a case-control study. Scientists compared the past diets of women who had breast cancer (the cases) to the past diets of similar women who did not have breast cancer (the controls) to try to tease out if there is something distinctive about the eating habits of women who developed the disease. The researchers found that certain women with breast cancer reported eating significantly less soluble fiber on average than the cancer-free women. Hence, soluble fiber may be protective.

The women in the study weren’t getting their fiber from supplements, though; they were getting it from food. But this could mean that eating more fiber is merely evidence that the cancer-free women are eating more plant foods, the only place fiber is found naturally. Therefore, fiber itself might not be the active ingredient. Maybe there’s something else protective in plant foods. “On the other hand,” noted the researchers, “an increased consumption of fiber from foods of plant origin … may reflect a reduced consumption of foods of animal origin.…”88 In other words, maybe it’s not what they were eating more of but what they were eating less of. The reason high fiber intake is associated with less breast cancer may be because of more beans—or less bologna.

Either way, an analysis of a dozen other breast cancer case-control studies reported similar findings, with lower breast cancer risk associated with indicators of fruit and vegetable intake, such as vitamin C intake, and higher breast cancer risk associated with higher saturated-fat intake (an indicator of meat, dairy, and processed food intake). And according to these studies, the more whole plant foods you eat, the better it is for your health: Every twenty grams of fiber intake per day was associated with a 15 percent lower risk of breast cancer.89

One problem with case-control studies, though, is that they rely on people’s memory of what they’ve been eating, potentially introducing what’s known as “recall bias.” For example, if people with cancer are more likely to selectively remember more of the unhealthy things they ate, this skewed recall could artificially inflate the correlation between eating certain foods and cancer. Prospective cohort studies avoid this problem by following a group (cohort) of healthy women and their diets forward (prospectively) in time to see who gets cancer and who doesn’t. A compilation of ten such prospective cohort studies on breast cancer and fiber intake came up with similar results to the dozen case-control studies mentioned above, a 14 percent lower risk of breast cancer for every twenty grams of fiber intake per day.90 The relationship between more fiber and less breast cancer may not be a straight line, though. Breast cancer risk may not significantly fall until at least twenty-five grams of fiber a day is reached.91

Unfortunately, the average American woman appears to eat less than fifteen grams of fiber per day—only about half the minimum daily recommendation.92 Even the average vegetarian in the United States may only get about twenty grams daily.93 Healthier vegetarians, though, may average thirty-seven grams a day, and vegans forty-six grams daily.94 Meanwhile, the whole-food, plant-based diets used therapeutically to reverse chronic disease contain upward of sixty grams of fiber.


/***************************************************************
Peeling Back Breast Cancer

“Does an Apple a Day Keep the Oncologist Away?” This was the title of a study published in the Annals of Oncology that set out to determine if eating an apple (or more) a day was associated with lower cancer risk. The results: Compared with people who average less than one apple a day, daily apple eaters had 24 percent lower odds of breast cancer, as well as significantly lower risks for ovarian cancer, laryngeal cancer, and colorectal cancer. The protective associations persisted even after considering these subjects’ intake of vegetables and other fruits, suggesting daily apple consumption was more than just an indicator of eating a healthier diet.96

The cancer protection apples appear to offer is assumed to arise from their antioxidant properties. Apple antioxidants are concentrated in the peel, which makes sense: The skin is the fruit’s first line of defense against the outside world. Expose the inner flesh, and it starts to brown (oxidize) within moments. The antioxidant power of the peel may be between two times (Golden Delicious) to six times (Idared) greater than the pulp.97

Beyond protecting against the initial free-radical hit to your DNA, apple extract has been shown to suppress the growth of both estrogen-receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cells in a petri dish.98 When researchers at my alma mater, Cornell University, separately dripped extracts of peel and flesh from the same apples on cancer cells, the peel stopped cancer growth ten times more effectively.99

Researchers found something in the peels of organic apples (presumably present in conventional ones as well) that appears to reactivate a tumor-suppressor gene called maspin (an acronym for mammary serine protease inhibitor). Maspin is one of the tools your body appears to use to keep breast cancer at bay. Breast cancer cells find a way to turn off this gene, but apple peels appear to be able to turn it back on. The researchers concluded that “apple peels should not be discarded from the diet.”

//**********************************
Breast Cancer Stem Cells

What if you’re already fighting breast cancer or are in remission? Green vegetables may still be protective. Over the past decade, scientists have been developing a new theory of cancer biology based on the role of stem cells. Stem cells are essentially the body’s raw materials—the “parents” from which all other cells with specialized functions are generated. As a result, stem cells are a critical component of the body’s repair system, including regrowing skin, bone, and muscle. Breast tissue naturally has many stem cells in reserve, which are used during pregnancy to create new milk glands.108 However, as miraculous as stem cells are, their immortality can also work against us. Instead of rebuilding organs, if they turn cancerous, they can build tumors.109

Cancerous stem cells may be why breast cancer can return, even up to twenty-five years after being fought off successfully the first time.110 When people are told that they are cancer-free, it may mean their tumors are gone, but if their stem cells are cancerous, the tumors still might reappear many years later. Sadly, someone who has been cancer-free for ten years might consider herself cured but actually may just be in remission. Smoldering cancerous stem cells may be just waiting to reignite.

The current battery of sophisticated chemo drugs and radiation regimens is based on animal models. Success of a given treatment is often measured by its ability to shrink tumors in rodents—but rats in laboratories only live for about two or three years in any case. Doctors may be shrinking tumors, but mutated stem cells may still be lurking, able to slowly rebuild new tumors over the ensuing years.111

What we need to do is strike at the root of cancer. We need to devise treatments aimed not just at reducing tumor bulk but at targeting what has been called the “beating heart of the tumor”:112 cancer stem cells.

That’s where broccoli may come in.

Sulforaphane, a dietary component of cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, has been shown to suppress the ability of breast cancer stem cells to form tumors.113 This means that if you’re currently in remission, eating lots of broccoli could theoretically help keep your cancer from returning. (I say theoretically because those results were from a petri dish.)

To be useful as a cancer fighter, sulforaphane would have to first be absorbed into your bloodstream when you eat broccoli. Then it would have to build up to the same concentration in breast tissue found to counter cancer stem cells in the lab. Is that possible? An innovative group at Johns Hopkins University sought to find out. The researchers asked women scheduled for breast reduction surgery to drink broccoli-sprout juice an hour before their procedure. Sure enough, after dissecting their breast tissue postsurgery, the researchers found evidence of significant sulforaphane buildup.114 In other words, we now know that the cancer-fighting nutrients in broccoli do find their way to the right place when we swallow them.

To reach the concentration of sulforaphane in the breast found to suppress breast cancer stem cells, however, you would have to eat at least a quarter-cup of broccoli sprouts a day.115 You can buy broccoli sprouts in the produce aisle, but they are cheap and easy to grow at home. They have a bit of a radishy bite to them, so I like to mix them into a salad to dilute their intensity.

There have yet to be randomized clinical trials to see if breast cancer survivors who eat broccoli live longer than those who don’t, but with no downside and only positive side effects, eating broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables is something I would recommend for everyone.

//********************
Flaxseeds

Flaxseeds are one of the first items ever considered to be health foods, treasured for their purported healing properties since at least the times of ancient Greece, when the renowned physician Hippocrates wrote about using them to treat patients.116

Better known as one of the richest plant sources of essential omega-3 fatty acids, flaxseeds are really set apart by their lignan content. Though lignans are found throughout the plant kingdom, flaxseeds have around one hundred times more lignans than other foods.117 What are lignans?

Lignans are phytoestrogens that can dampen the effects of the body’s own estrogen. This is why flaxseeds are considered a first-line medical therapy for menstrual breast pain.118 In terms of breast cancer risk, eating about a daily tablespoonful of ground flaxseeds can extend a woman’s menstrual cycle by about a day.119 This means she’ll have fewer periods over the course of a lifetime and, therefore, presumably less estrogen exposure and reduced breast cancer risk.120 Just as broccoli doesn’t technically contain sulforaphane (only the precursors that turn into sulforaphane when chewed—see here), flaxseeds don’t contain lignans, only lignan precursors, which need to be activated. This task is performed by the good bacteria in your gut.

The gut bacteria’s role may help explain why women with frequent urinary tract infections may be at a higher risk of breast cancer: Every course of antibiotics you take can kill bacteria indiscriminately, meaning it may stymie the ability of the good bacteria in your gut to take full advantage of the lignans in your diet.121 (Yet another reason you should take antibiotics only when necessary.)

Lignan intake is associated with significantly reduced breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women.122 This effect is presumed to be due to lignans’ further estrogen-dampening effects. But since lignans are found in healthy foods like berries, whole grains, and dark, leafy greens, could they just be an indicator of a healthy diet?

In a petri dish, lignans do directly suppress the proliferation of breast cancer cells.123 But the strongest evidence to date that there really is something special about this class of phytonutrients comes from interventional trials, starting with a 2010 study funded by the National Cancer Institute. Researchers took about forty-five women at high risk of breast cancer—meaning they had suspicious breast biopsies or had previously suffered from breast cancer—and gave them the equivalent of about two teaspoons of ground flaxseeds every day. Needle biopsies of breast tissue were taken before and after the yearlong study. The results: On average, the women had fewer precancerous changes in their breasts after the year of flax lignans than before they started. Eighty percent (thirty-six of forty-five) had a drop in their levels of Ki-67, a biomarker (indicator) of increased cell proliferation. This finding suggests that sprinkling a few spoonfuls of ground flaxseeds on your oatmeal or whatever you’re eating throughout the day may reduce the risk of breast cancer.124

What about women who already have breast cancer? Breast cancer survivors who have higher levels of lignans in their bloodstreams125,126 and diets127 appear to survive significantly longer. This outcome may be due to the fact that women who eat flaxseeds may also see a rise in the levels of endostatin in their breasts.128 (Endostatin is a protein produced by your body to help starve tumors of their blood supply.)

The evidence from studies like these appeared so compelling that scientists performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of flaxseeds for breast cancer patients—one of the few times a food has ever been so rigorously put to the test. Researchers located women with breast cancer scheduled for surgery and divided them randomly into two groups: Every day, group one ate a muffin containing flaxseed, while group two ate a muffin that looked and tasted the same, but had no flaxseed in it. Biopsies of the tumors in the flax and no-flax groups were taken at the beginning of the study and then compared with the pathology of the tumor removed during surgery about five weeks later.

Was there any difference? Compared with the women who ate the placebo muffins, women consuming the muffins with flaxseed, on average, witnessed their tumor-cell proliferation decrease, cancer-cell death rates increase, and their c-erB2 scores go down. C-erB2 is a marker of cancer aggressiveness; the higher your score, the higher the potential for breast cancer to metastasize and spread throughout the body. In other words, the flaxseeds appeared to make the subjects’ cancer less aggressive. The researchers concluded, “Dietary flaxseed has the potential to reduce tumor growth in patients with breast cancer.… [F]laxseed, which is inexpensive and readily available, may be a potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used breast cancer drugs.”129

//***********************************
Soy and Breast Cancer

Soybeans naturally contain another class of phytoestrogens called isoflavones. People hear the word “estrogen” in the word “phytoestrogens” and assume that means soy has estrogen-like effects. Not necessarily. Phytoestrogens dock into the same receptors as your own estrogen but have a weaker effect, so they can act to block the effects of your more powerful animal estrogen.

There are two types of estrogen receptors in the body, alpha and beta. Your own estrogen prefers alpha receptors, while plant estrogens (phytoestrogens) have an affinity for the beta receptors.130 The effects of soy phytoestrogens on different tissues therefore depend on the ratio of alpha to beta receptors.131

Estrogen has positive effects in some tissues and potentially negative effects in others. For example, high levels of estrogen can be good for the bones but can increase the likelihood of developing breast cancer. Ideally, you’d like what’s called a “selective estrogen receptor modulator” in your body that would have proestrogenic effects in some tissues and antiestrogenic effects in others.

Well, that’s what soy phytoestrogens appear to be.132 Soy seems to lower breast cancer risk,133 an antiestrogenic effect, but can also help reduce menopausal hot-flash symptoms,134 a proestrogenic effect. So, by eating soy, you may be able to enjoy the best of both worlds.

What about soy for women with breast cancer? There have been five studies on breast cancer survivors and soy consumption. Overall, researchers have found that women diagnosed with breast cancer who ate the most soy lived significantly longer and had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer recurrence than those who ate less.135 The quantity of phytoestrogens found in just a single cup of soy milk136 may reduce the risk of breast cancer returning by 25 percent.137 The improvement in survival for those eating more soy foods was found both in women whose tumors were responsive to estrogen (estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer) and those whose tumors were not (estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer). This also held true for both young women and older women.138 In one study, for example, 90 percent of the breast cancer patients who ate the most soy phytoestrogens after diagnosis were still alive five years later, while half of those who ate little to no soy were dead.139

One way soy may decrease cancer risk and improve survival is by helping to reactivate BRCA genes.140 BRCA1 and BRCA2 are so-called caretaker genes, cancer-suppressing genes responsible for DNA repair. Mutations in this gene can cause a rare form of hereditary breast cancer. As has been well publicized, Angelina Jolie decided to undergo a preventive double mastectomy. A National Breast Cancer Coalition survey found that the majority of women believe that most breast cancers occur among women with a family history or a genetic predisposition to the disease.141 The reality is that as few as 2.5 percent of breast cancer cases are attributable to breast cancer running in the family.142

If the vast majority of breast cancer patients have fully functional BRCA genes, meaning that their DNA-repair mechanisms are intact, how did their breast cancer form, grow, and spread? Breast tumors appear able to suppress the expression of the gene through a process called methylation. While the gene itself is operational, the cancer has effectively turned it off or at least turned down its expression, potentially aiding the metastatic spread of a tumor.143 That’s where soy may come in.

The isoflavones in soy appear to help turn BRCA protection back on, removing the methyl straitjacket the tumor tried to place on it.144 The dose breast cancer researchers used to achieve this result in vitro was pretty hefty, though—the equivalent to eating about a cup of soybeans.

Soy may also help women with variations of other breast cancer susceptibility genes known as MDM2 and CYP1B1. Women at increased genetic risk of breast cancer may therefore especially benefit from high soy intake.145 The bottom line is that no matter which genes you inherit, changes in your diet may be able to affect DNA expression at a genetic level, potentially boosting your ability to fight disease.

//******************************* MUSHROOMS ************************
Why Do Women in Asia Have Less Breast Cancer?

Though breast cancer is the most common cancer specific to women globally, Asian women are up to five times less likely to develop breast cancer than North American women.146 Why?

One possibility is their intake of green tea, a common staple in many Asian diets. Green tea has been associated with about a 30 percent reduction in breast cancer risk.147 Another strong possibility is a relatively high intake of soy, which, if consumed consistently during childhood, may cut the risk of breast cancer later in life by half. If women consume soy primarily as an adult, though, their risk reduction may only be closer to 25 percent.148

While intake of green tea and soy might account for a twofold reduction in Asian women’s breast cancer risk, it doesn’t fully account for the disparity between Eastern and Western breast cancer rates.

Asian populations also eat more mushrooms.149 As noted in the box on red wine here, white mushrooms have also been shown to block the estrogen synthase enzyme, at least in a petri dish. So researchers decided to investigate if there was a link between mushroom intake and breast cancer. They compared the mushroom consumption of one thousand breast cancer patients to one thousand healthy subjects of similar age, weight, and smoking and exercise status. The women whose mushroom consumption averaged just about one-half a mushroom or more per day had 64 percent lower odds of breast cancer compared with women who didn’t eat mushrooms at all. Eating mushrooms and sipping at least half a tea bag’s worth of green tea each day was associated with nearly 90 percent lower breast cancer odds.150

Oncologists, doctors who treat cancer, can take pride in the strides they’ve made. Thanks to improvements in cancer treatment, cancer patients are living longer and healthier as has been celebrated in oncology journal editorials with such titles as “Cancer Survivors, 10 Million Strong and Growing!” Yes, more than 10 million cancer patients are still alive today, with “perhaps as many as 1 million new individuals in the United States joining those ranks each year.”151 That is an accomplishment, but wouldn’t it be even better to prevent those million cases in the first place?

In medicine, a cancer diagnosis is considered a “teachable moment” when we can motivate a patient to improve his or her lifestyle.152 By then, though, it may already be too late.


//*******************************
How Not to Die from Suicidal Depression

Healthy food can have a powerful effect on mood. But don’t take only my word for it. Take Margaret’s too. After hearing me speak at her church, she sent me this e-mail:

Dear Dr. Greger,

I was diagnosed with clinical depression by a psychiatrist when I was ten years old. I spent all my teenage years and twenties on a cocktail of medications for depression. Even on medications, I was still haunted by intrusive thoughts of suicide on a daily basis. Worse yet, the medications gave me headaches, nausea, and vivid, often frightening, dreams. I was sleepy all the time, and despite the scary dreams, I had to nap every day. I slept a lot—a couple of hours midday and then close to ten hours every night. Even with these side effects, I was afraid not to take these medications because I really wanted to live, and I was scared that without meds I might get so depressed I would kill myself.

Eventually I got married … and divorced. Was hospitalized several times during my marriage for depression. To be honest, I just never had any sex drive, and my husband took it personally. I guess I’ll never know if my missing libido was just a side effect of all the medications I was on or the depression itself.

About nine years ago, I heard you speak at my church. I realized I had just spent the last two decades in a medication-induced haze. And without ever really feeling good a single one of those days. I talked to my psychiatrist about how I wanted to completely overhaul my diet and try to back off the medications under her supervision. Much to my surprise, she was supportive. Well, I’ve been whole food and plant based for nine years and haven’t had a further relapse. Not that I haven’t been sad from time to time but I haven’t had any more thoughts of suicide or any more hospitalizations. I sleep like a normal person now! Everyone tells me I am a different person since I changed my diet. I just wanted to thank you. My fiancé would like to thank you too! I owe you my life!

How can you prevent death by suicide? For those unfamiliar with the ravages of mental illness, the flippant answer is: Just don’t do it. In fact, death from other leading killers, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, may be just as much a choice as death from suicide, since psychiatric disorders can cloud your judgment. Nearly forty thousand Americans take their own lives each year,1 and depression appears to be a leading cause.2 Thankfully, lifestyle interventions can help repair your mind as well as your body.

In 1946, the World Health Organization defined health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”3 In other words, you can be in excellent physical shape—enjoying low cholesterol, a healthy body weight, and good overall physical fitness—but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re healthy. Mental health can be just as important as physical health.

Major depression is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental illnesses. An estimated 7 percent of American adults suffer from serious depression—that’s about sixteen million people who have at least one depressive episode each year.4 Now, everyone feels sad occasionally. A full range of emotions is part of what makes us human. Depression, however, is not just sadness. It is characterized by weeks of such symptoms as low or sad mood, diminished interest in activities that used to be pleasurable, weight gain or loss, fatigue, inappropriate guilt, difficulty concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death.

Indeed, major depression can be a life-threatening ailment.

Good mental health isn’t “merely the absence of disease,” though. Just because you’re not depressed doesn’t necessarily mean you’re happy. There are twenty times more studies published on health and depression than there are on health and happiness.5 In recent years, however, the field of “positive psychology” has emerged, focusing on the relationship between optimal mental and physical health.

Growing evidence indicates that positive psychological well-being is associated with reduced risk of physical illness, but which came first? Are people healthier because they’re happy, or are people just happier because they’re healthy?

Prospective studies that follow individuals over time have found that people starting out happier do indeed end up healthier. An analysis of seventy such studies on mortality concluded that “positive psychological well-being has a favorable effect on survival in both healthy and diseased populations.”6 Those who are happier appear to live longer.

Not so fast, though. While positive mental states may be associated with less stress and more resilience to infection, positive well-being might also be accompanied by a healthy lifestyle. In general, people who feel satisfied appear to smoke less, exercise more, and eat healthier.7 So is being happier just a marker of good health and not a cause of it? To find out, researchers set out to make people sick.

Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University took hundreds of individuals—some happy, some unhappy—and paid them $800 each to be allowed to drip the common cold virus into their noses. Even if someone with a cold sneezes right into your face and the virus gets into your nose, you won’t get sick automatically, because your immune system may be able to fight it off. So the study question was: Whose immune system would be better at fighting off a common virus—those in the group initially rated as happy, peppy, and relaxed, or those in the group who were anxious, hostile, and depressed?

About one in three of the negative-emotion individuals failed to successfully fight off the virus and came down with a cold. But only one in five of the happy individuals became sick, even after the researchers took into account such factors as subjects’ sleep patterns, exercise habits, and stress levels.8 In a subsequent study, the researchers even exposed subjects (who had also been paid) to the influenza virus, a more serious infection. Once again, increased positive emotions were associated with decreased verified illness rates.9 Happier people, it seems, are less likely to get sick.

So mental health does appear to play a part in physical health. That’s why it’s crucial that the food you eat support both your mind and your body. As you’ll see, common foods from leafy green vegetables to your basic garden-variety tomato may positively affect your brain chemistry and help ward off depression. In fact, even simply smelling a common spice may improve your emotional state.

But avoiding the blues is not just about eating your greens. There are also components in certain foods that may increase the risk of depression, such as arachidonic acid, an inflammation-promoting compound found mostly in chicken and eggs in the diet that is blamed for potentially impairing mood by inflaming the brain.

//**********************************************************
Arachidonic Acid

Studies on the emotional health and mood states of those eating plant-based diets suggest that eating less meat isn’t just good for us physically; it’s good for us emotionally too. Researchers employed two psychological tests, the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). POMS measures levels of depression, anger, hostility, fatigue, and confusion. The DASS gauges other negative mood states as well, including hopelessness, lack of interest, anhedonia (lack of pleasure), agitation, irritability, and impatience with other people. Subjects eating plant-based diets appeared to experience significantly fewer negative emotions than omnivores. Those eating better also reported feeling more “vigor.”10

The researchers offered two explanations for their findings. First, people eating better diets may be happier because they’re healthier.11 Those eating plant-based diets don’t just have lower rates of many of the leading killer diseases but also appear to have lower rates of such annoying ills as hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and ulcers; fewer surgeries; fewer hospitalizations; and only about half the odds of being on drugs, including tranquilizers, aspirin, insulin, blood pressure pills, pain medications, antacids, laxatives, or sleeping pills.12 (Being able to avoid doctor visits and health insurance hassles would make anyone less irritable, stressed, and depressed!)

The researchers also suggested a more direct explanation for their results: Maybe the proinflammatory compound arachidonic acid found in animal products can “adversely impact mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation.”13 The body metabolizes arachidonic acid into an array of inflammatory chemicals. In fact, that’s how anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen work to relieve pain and swelling—by blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid into these inflammatory end products. Maybe the mental health of omnivores was being comparatively compromised by inflammation in their brains.

Inflammation isn’t always bad, of course. When the area around a splinter gets all red, hot, and swollen, it’s a sign that the body is using arachidonic acid to mount an inflammatory response to help fight off infection. But your body already makes all the arachidonic acid you need, so you don’t need to take in any more via your diet.14 In this way, arachidonic acid resembles cholesterol, another essential component that the body makes all on its own: When you add excess amounts through diet, it may upset your system’s internal balance.15 In this particular case, the researchers suspected arachidonic acid intake might impair the body’s emotional state. There are data suggesting that people with higher levels of arachidonic acid in their blood may end up at significantly higher risk of suicide and episodes of major depression.16

The top-five sources of arachidonic acid in the American diet are chicken, eggs, beef, pork, and fish, although chicken and eggs alone contribute more than the other top sources combined.17 Just a single egg’s worth of arachidonic acid a day may significantly raise arachidonic acid levels in the blood.18 Overall, omnivores appear to consume about nine times more arachidonic acid than those eating plant-based diets.19

The study showing improved moods and emotional states in those eating plant-based diets was a cross-sectional study, meaning it was a snapshot in time. What if people who start out mentally healthier go on to eat healthier, too, and not the other way around? To show cause and effect, researchers would have to perform an interventional study, the gold standard of nutritional science: Gather subjects, change their diets, and see what happens. The same research team did just that. They took men and women who ate meat at least once a day and took away their eggs and chicken, along with other meats, to see what would happen to their moods. Within just two weeks, the study subjects experienced a significant improvement in measures of their mood states.20 The researchers concluded: “Perhaps eating less meat can help protect mood in omnivores, particularly important in those susceptible to affective disorders [such as depression].”21

Given these results, another research team decided to put a healthy diet to the test in a workplace setting, where healthy bodies and minds could potentially translate into improved productivity—and elevate the mood of shareholders as well. A group of overweight and diabetic employees at a major insurance company was encouraged to follow a whole-food, plant-based diet, cutting out all meat, eggs, dairy, oil, and junk foods. There was no portion-size restriction, no calorie counting, and no carb tracking, and participants were explicitly told not to change their exercise habits. Meals were not provided, but the company cafeteria did start offering such daily options as bean burritos and lentil and minestrone soups. A control group of employees received no dietary advice.22

Despite the dietary restrictions, over the course of about five months, the plant-eating group reported greater diet satisfaction than the control group. How well did they do? The plant-based group experienced improved digestion, increased energy, and better sleep, as well as significant improvement in their physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health. No surprise, then, that they showed measurable improvements in work productivity too.23

Based on this success, a much larger study of plant-based nutrition was conducted at ten corporate locations across the country from San Diego, California, to Macon, Georgia. The same resounding success was reported, showing improvements not only in subjects’ body weight, blood sugar levels, and ability to control cholesterol24 but also in their emotional states, including depression, anxiety, fatigue, sense of well-being, and daily functioning.

Fighting the Blues with Greens

Here’s a statistic you probably haven’t heard: Higher consumption of vegetables may cut the odds of developing depression by as much as 62 percent.26 A review in the journal Nutritional Neuroscience concluded that, in general, eating lots of fruits and veggies may present “a non-invasive, natural, and inexpensive therapeutic means to support a healthy brain.”27

But how, exactly?

The traditional explanation of how depression works, known as the monoamine theory, proposes that the condition arises out of a chemical imbalance in the brain. The billions of nerves in your brain communicate with each other using chemicals called neurotransmitters. Your nerve cells don’t physically touch one another. Instead, they manufacture and deploy neurotransmitters to bridge the gap between them. The levels of an important class of neurotransmitters called monoamines, which includes serotonin and dopamine, are controlled by an enzyme called monoamine oxidase (known as MAO) that breaks down any excess monoamines. People who are depressed appear to have elevated levels of this enzyme in their brains.28 Thus, the theory goes, depression is caused by abnormally low levels of monoamine neurotransmitters due to elevated levels of the neurotransmitter-munching enzyme.

Antidepressant medications were developed to try to boost the levels of neurotransmitters to offset their accelerated breakdown. But if the excess MAO is responsible for depression, why not just develop a drug that blocks this enzyme? Such drugs do exist, but they have serious risks—not the least of which is the dreaded “cheese effect,” in which eating certain foods (such as certain cheeses, cured meats, and fermented foods) while on the drug can potentially cause fatal brain hemorrhaging.29

If only there were a way to tamp down the monoamine oxidase enzyme safely. Well, it turns out that many plant foods, including apples, berries, grapes, onions, and green tea, contain phytonutrients that appear to naturally inhibit the MAO, as do such spices as cloves, oregano, cinnamon, and nutmeg.30 This may help explain why those eating plant-rich diets have lower rates of depression.31

Even on a day-to-day basis, studies have shown that the more fruits and vegetables you eat, the happier, calmer, and more energetic you may feel that day—and this positivity can spill over into the next day. For your diet to have a meaningful psychological impact, though, you may need to consume approximately seven servings of fruits or eight servings of vegetables each day.

//**************************************
Seeds and Serotonin

Although some plant foods contain significant amounts of serotonin,33 the so-called happiness hormone, serotonin can’t cross the blood-brain barrier. This means that dietary sources of serotonin can’t make it into the brain, but the building block of serotonin, an amino acid called tryptophan, can get from your mouth to your blood to your brain. Tryptophan depletion experiments in the 1970s showed that people given specially concocted tryptophan-deficient diets suffered from irritability, anger, and depression.34 So if you give people extra tryptophan, will they feel better?

That’s the theory. However, in the 1980s, certain tryptophan supplements created a debacle, causing a rash of deaths.35 But if tryptophan is an amino acid and if proteins are made out of amino acids, why can’t you just give people high-protein meals to boost their serotonin levels by delivering extra tryptophan to the brain? It’s been tried, and it’s failed,36 likely because other amino acids in protein-rich foods crowd out the tryptophan for access to the brain. However, carbohydrate ingestion does the opposite: It helps shunt many nontryptophan amino acids out from the bloodstream and into the muscles, allowing tryptophan greater access into the brain. For example, having a carb-rich breakfast like waffles and orange juice resulted in higher tryptophan levels in those studied than did a protein-rich breakfast of turkey, eggs, and cheese.37

This principle may explain why women suffering from premenstrual syndrome (PMS) sometimes crave carbohydrate-rich food. Consumption of even a single carb-rich, protein-poor meal has been shown to improve depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores among women with PMS.38 In a yearlong study, about one hundred men and women were randomly assigned to eat either a low-carb or high-carb diet. By the end of the year, the subjects eating the high-carb diets experienced significantly less depression, hostility, and mood disturbance than those in the low-carb group. This result is consistent with studies finding better moods and less anxiety among populations eating diets higher in carbohydrates and lower in fats and protein.39

Carbohydrates may facilitate tryptophan transport into the brain, but you would still need a dietary source. Ideally, it would have a high tryptophan-to-protein ratio to facilitate brain access.40 Such seeds as sesame, sunflower, or pumpkin may fit the bill. Indeed, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of butternut squash seeds for social anxiety disorder reported a significant improvement in an objective measurement in anxiety within an hour of consumption.41 All of these factors may contribute to the comprehensive improvement in mood one may achieve after just a few weeks on a plant-based diet.

//
Saffron

The earliest recorded medical use of a spice appears to be more than 3,600 years ago, when saffron was evidently first used for healing.43 A few thousand years later, scientists finally put saffron to the test in a head-to-head trial against the antidepressant drug Prozac for the treatment of clinical depression. Both the spice and the drug worked equally well in reducing depression symptoms.44 As you can see in the box here, this may not be saying much, but at the very least, the saffron was safer in terms of side effects. For example, 20 percent of people in the Prozac group suffered sexual dysfunction, a common occurrence with many antidepressant medications, whereas no one in the saffron group did.

However, saffron may be one of those rare cases in which the natural remedy is more expensive than the drug. Saffron is the world’s most expensive spice. It is harvested from crocus flowers, specifically the dried stigmas (the threadlike tips inside the flower), which are ground up to make the spice. You need more than fifty thousand crocuses—enough to cover a football field—to produce just a single pound of saffron.45

A Prozac-equivalent dose of saffron may cost more than twice as much as the drug, but a subsequent study found that even just smelling saffron appeared to have psychological benefits. Though researchers diluted the spice so much that the study subjects couldn’t detect its odor, they still noted a significant drop in stress hormones measured in women who sniffed the saffron for twenty minutes compared with those who spent twenty minutes smelling a placebo, along with significant improvement in the women’s symptoms of anxiety.46

So if you’re feeling anxious, perhaps wake up and smell the saffron.

//
Coffee and Aspartame

Speaking of waking up to pleasant aromas, a cup of coffee may be doing more for the brain than making it feel less groggy in the morning. Researchers from Harvard University looked at data from three large-scale cohort studies of more than two hundred thousand American men and women. They found that people who drank two or more cups of coffee daily appeared to have about only half the suicide risk compared to non-coffee drinkers.47 What about drinking more than four cups a day? A Kaiser Permanente study of more than one hundred thousand people found that suicide risk seemed to continue to drop with increases in coffee dose. People who drank more than six cups a day were 80 percent less likely to commit suicide,48 though drinking eight or more cups a day has been associated with increased suicide risk.49

What you put in your coffee may also make a difference. The NIH-AARP study, which followed hundreds of thousands of Americans for a decade, found that frequent consumption of sweetened beverages may increase the risk of depression among older adults. Indeed, adding sugar to coffee may negate many of its positive effects on mood, and adding the artificial sweetener aspartame (found in Equal and NutraSweet) or saccharine (in Sweet’n Low) was associated with an increased risk of depression.50

The controversy surrounding the neurological effects of aspartame began in the 1980s.51 At first, concern was limited to those with preexisting mental illness. An early study at Case Western Reserve University was halted prematurely for safety reasons because subjects with a history of depression appeared to be experiencing such severe reactions to the sweetener. The researchers concluded that “individuals with mood disorders are particularly sensitive to this artificial sweetener and its use in this population should be discouraged.”52

Only recently were the neurobehavioral effects of aspartame investigated in a population free from mental illness. Healthy individuals were split into two groups—half were given a higher dose of aspartame (the equivalent of about three liters of Diet Coke’s worth) and the other half received a lower dose (a single liter of Diet Coke’s worth). Then the groups switched.53 Bear in mind that the higher-aspartame diet contained just half the acceptable daily intake of the stuff, as determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.54 After only eight days on the higher-aspartame dose, participants exhibited more depression and irritability and performed worse on certain brain function tests.55 So not only may aspartame cause adverse mental effects in sensitive populations but it may also harm the general public at sufficient doses.

Avoiding diet soda and those pastel paper packets seems easy enough, but artificial sweeteners are also present in more than six thousand products,56 including breath mints, cereals, chewing gums, jams and jellies, juice drinks, puddings, and even nutritional bars and yogurts.57 This prevalence has led researchers to assert that aspartame “is impossible to completely eradicate from daily encounters.”58 But, of course, that’s only true for people who eat processed foods. This is yet another reason to spend most of your time at the grocery store in the produce aisle. Discriminating shoppers make it a priority to read ingredients lists, but the healthiest foods in the supermarket don’t even have them.

//**********************
Exercise versus Antidepressants

We’ve known for decades that even a single workout can elevate mood59 and that physical activity is associated with decreased symptoms of depression. One study of nearly five thousand people across the country, for example, found that people who exercised regularly had 25 percent lower odds of a major depression diagnosis.60

Of course, studies like these may not mean that exercise reduces depression. Maybe it means that depression reduces exercise. In other words, if you’re depressed, you might feel too lousy to get out of bed and go for a walk. What was needed to test this idea was an interventional study, one in which depressed subjects were split at random (randomized) into two groups, one that exercised and one that didn’t.

That’s what a team of researchers from Duke University attempted. They randomly assigned depressed men and women aged fifty or older to either begin an aerobic exercise program or take the antidepressant drug sertraline (Zoloft). Within four months, the mood of those in the drug group improved so much that they were, on average, no longer depressed. But the same powerful effect was found in the exercise group—that is, the group of people who weren’t taking any drugs. Exercise, it seemed, works about as well as medication.61

Let’s play devil’s advocate for a moment: The drug-free group in the Duke study met three times each week for an exercise class. Could the social stimulation rather than the exercise have improved their mood? With this question in mind, the same researchers subsequently conducted the largest-ever exercise trial of patients with depression. This time, they added a group, so one group took antidepressants, one group took an exercise class, and a new group did exercises by themselves at home. The results? No matter the setting—whether subjects were alone or in a group—exercise appeared to work about as well as drugs at bringing depression into remission.62

So before your doctor writes you a prescription for an antidepressant, ask about prescribing a daily workout instead.

//*********************** Antioxidants and Folate in pill form don't work *******************
Antioxidants and Folate

Accumulating evidence suggests that free radicals—those highly unstable molecules that cause tissue damage and contribute to aging—may play an important role in the development of various psychiatric disorders, including depression.63 Modern imaging techniques confirm autopsy studies showing a shrinkage of certain emotion centers in the brains of depressed patients that may be due to death of nerve cells in these areas caused by free radicals.64

This phenomenon may help explain why those who eat more fruits and vegetables, which are rich in the antioxidants that extinguish free radicals, appear protected against depression. A study of nearly three hundred thousand Canadians found that greater fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with lower risk of depression, psychological distress, mood and anxiety disorders, and poor perceived mental health. The researchers concluded that eating antioxidant-rich plant foods “may dampen the detrimental effects of oxidative stress on mental health.”65

The Canadian study relied on questionnaires asking people to self-report fruit and vegetable intake, a method that’s not always accurate. A nationwide American study took it one step further and measured the level of carotenoid phytonutrients in people’s bloodstreams. These phytonutrients include some of the yellow, orange, and red antioxidant pigments found naturally in some of our healthiest foods, including sweet potatoes and green leafy vegetables. Not only did people with higher levels of these nutrients in their bloodstreams have a lower risk of depression symptoms but there was also an apparent “dose-response relationship,” meaning that the higher the level of phytonutrients, the better people seemed to feel.66

Among the carotenoids, lycopene (the red pigment in tomatoes) has the highest antioxidant activity. Indeed, a study of nearly one thousand elderly men and women found that people who ate tomatoes or tomato products daily had just half the odds of depression compared with those who ate them once a week or less.67

If antioxidants are so helpful, why can’t we just pop a few antioxidant pills? Well, only food sources of antioxidants appear to be protectively associated with depression. The same can’t be said for dietary supplements.68 This finding may indicate that the form and delivery of the antioxidants we consume are crucial to ensure their best effects. Alternatively, antioxidants may just be a marker for other components of plant-rich diets, such as folate.

Folate is a B vitamin concentrated in beans and greens. (Its name comes from the Latin word folium, meaning “leaf,” because it was first isolated in spinach.) Early studies linking depression to low folate levels in the blood were cross-sectional in nature, meaning they were only snapshots in time. For this reason, we didn’t know whether low folate intake led to depression or if depression itself led to low folate intake.69 However, more recent studies following people over time suggest that low dietary folate intake may indeed increase the risk of severe depression by as much as threefold.70 However, once again, folate supplements (folic acid) do not appear to help.71

Vegetables—including antioxidant-rich tomatoes and folate-packed greens—may be good for the body and the mind.

//************************** How could drug companies get away with this? ****************************
Do Antidepressant Drugs Really Work?

We’ve seen that saffron and exercise compare favorably to drugs in treating depression, but how much is that really saying? Thousands of published studies seem to have demonstrated that antidepressant drugs are effective.72 The key word here, though, may be published. What if drug companies decided to publish only those studies that showed a positive effect but quietly shelved and concealed any studies showing the drugs didn’t work? To find out if this was the case, researchers applied to the Food and Drug Administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to get access to the published and unpublished studies submitted by pharmaceutical companies. What they found was shocking.

According to the published literature, the results of nearly all antidepressant trials were positive. In contrast, FDA analysis of trial data—including the unpublished studies—demonstrated that roughly half of the trials showed the drugs didn’t work after all. When all the data—published and unpublished—were combined, antidepressants failed to show a clinically significant advantage over placebo sugar pills.73 This finding suggests that the placebo effect explains the apparent clinical effectiveness of antidepressants. In other words, improvements in mood may be a result of the patient’s belief in the power of the drug—not the drug itself.74

Even worse, the FOIA documents revealed that the FDA knew that these drugs—such as Paxil and Prozac—didn’t work much better than placebo yet made an explicit decision to shield drug companies by keeping this information from the public and prescribing physicians.75 How could drug companies get away with this? The pharmaceutical industry is considered one of the most profitable and politically powerful industries in the United States, and mental illness is considered a golden goose: chronic, common, and often treated with multiple drugs.76 Indeed, antidepressants are currently prescribed to more than 8 percent of the population.77

Just because antidepressant drugs may not work better than fake pills doesn’t mean they don’t work at all. Antidepressants offer substantial benefits to millions of people suffering from depression. And although the placebo effect is real and powerful, antidepressants do seem to beat out sugar pills in reducing symptoms in the most severely depressed—perhaps about 10 percent of patients (although admittedly, this statistic also means that about 90 percent of depressed patients may be prescribed medication with negligible benefit).78

If doctors are willing to give patients placebo-equivalent treatments, some argue that it would be better for them to just lie to patients and give them actual sugar pills.79 Unlike the drugs, sugar pills do not cause side effects. For example, antidepressants cause sexual dysfunction in up to three-quarters of users. Other problems may include long-term weight gain and insomnia. And about one in five people have withdrawal symptoms when they try to quit.80

Perhaps most tragically, antidepressants may make people more likely to become depressed in the future. Studies show that patients are more likely to become depressed again after treatment with antidepressants than after treatment by other means, including placebos.81 So even if the mood-boosting benefit of exercise is also a placebo effect, at least it’s one with benefits rather than risks.

How Not to Die from Prostate Cancer

The prostate is a walnut-sized gland located between the bladder and base of the penis, just in front of the rectum. It surrounds the urethra, the outlet from the bladder, and secretes the fluid portion of semen. Just as glandular tissue in the breast can become cancerous, so can glandular tissue in the prostate.

Autopsy studies show that about half of men over the age of eighty have prostate cancer.1 Most men die with prostate cancer without ever knowing they had it. That’s the problem with the emphasis on screenings—many prostate cancers that are detected may never have led to harm even if they’d gone undiscovered.2 Unfortunately, not all men are so lucky. Nearly twenty-eight thousand die each year from prostate cancer.3

Milk and Prostate Cancer

Since the U.S. National Dairy Board was first created by the Dairy and Tobacco Adjustment Act of 1983, it has spent more than $1 billion on advertising. By now, we’re all familiar with its various slogans, such as “Milk is a natural.” But is it? Think about it. Humans are the only species who drink milk after weaning. It also does seem a bit unnatural to drink the milk of another species.

What about “Milk: It Does a Body Good”? All foods of animal origin contain sex steroid hormones, such as estrogen, but today’s genetically “improved” dairy cows are milked throughout their pregnancies when their reproductive hormones are particularly high.4 These hormones naturally found even in organic cow’s milk may play a role in the various associations identified between milk and other dairy products and hormone-related conditions, including acne,5 diminished male reproductive potential,6 and premature puberty.7 The hormone content in milk may explain why women who drink it appear to have five times the rate of twin births compared with women who do not drink milk.8 When it comes to cancer, though, the greater concern may have to do with growth hormones.9

Mother Nature designed cow’s milk to put a few hundred pounds on a baby calf within a few months. A lifetime of human exposure to these growth factors in milk may help explain the connections found between dairy consumption and certain cancers.10 Leading Harvard University nutrition experts have expressed concern that the hormones in dairy products and other growth factors could stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors.11 Experimental evidence suggests that dairy could also promote the conversion of precancerous lesions or mutated cells into invasive cancers.12

Concerns about milk and other dairy products first arose from population-scale data, such as the twenty-five-fold increase in prostate cancer in Japanese men since World War II, which coincided with a sevenfold increase in egg consumption, a ninefold increase in meat consumption, and a twentyfold increase in dairy consumption.13 Though the rest of their diets remained comparatively stable and similar trends have been noted in other countries,14 there were myriad changes in Japanese society beyond eating more animal products that could have contributed to these rising cancer rates. So scientists took a closer look.

To control for as many variables as possible, researchers devised an experiment in which they dripped milk on human prostate cancer cells in a petri dish. The researchers chose organic cow’s milk to exclude any effect of added hormones, such as the bovine growth hormone, which is commonly injected into conventionally raised cows so they produce more milk.15 The researchers found that cow’s milk stimulated the growth of human prostate cancer cells in each of fourteen separate experiments, producing an average increase in cancer growth rate of more than 30 percent. In contrast, almond milk suppressed the growth of the cancer cells by more than 30 percent.16

What happens in a petri dish, though, doesn’t necessarily happen in people. Nevertheless, a compilation of case-control studies did conclude that cow’s milk consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer,17 and the same outcome was found for cohort studies.18 A 2015 meta-analysis found that high intakes of dairy products—milk, low-fat milk, and cheese, but not nondairy sources of calcium—appear to increase total prostate cancer risk.19

But, you may be wondering, if you don’t drink milk, what will happen to your bones? Doesn’t milk help prevent osteoporosis? It turns out that the promised benefit may be just another empty marketing ploy. A meta-analysis of cow’s milk intake and hip fracture studies shows no significant protection.20 Even if you were to start drinking milk during adolescence in an attempt to bolster peak bone mass, it probably wouldn’t reduce your chances of fracture later in life.21 One recent set of studies involving one hundred thousand men and women followed for up to two decades even suggested milk may increase bone and hip fracture rates.22

Some babies are born with a rare birth defect called galactosemia, in which they lack the enzymes needed to detoxify galactose, a type of sugar found in milk. This means they end up with elevated levels of galactose in their blood, which can cause bone loss.23 A group of Swedish researchers figured that even among normal people who can detoxify the stuff, it might not be good for their bones to be drinking all that galactose in milk every day.24 And galactose may not just hurt bones. Scientists actually use galactose to induce premature aging in lab animals. When researchers slip lab animals some galactose, the “life-shortened animals showed neurodegeneration, mental retardation and cognitive dysfunction … diminished immune responses and reduction of reproductive ability.”25 And it doesn’t take much, just the human equivalent of one to two glasses worth of milk a day.26

However, since humans aren’t rodents, researchers investigated the connection between milk intake and mortality, as well as fracture risk in large populations of milk drinkers.27 In addition to significantly more bone and hip fractures, researchers found higher rates of premature death, more heart disease, and significantly more cancer for each daily glass of milk women drank. Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of dying early.28 Men with higher milk consumption also had a higher rate of death, although they didn’t have higher fracture rates.29

Overall, the study showed a dose-dependent higher rate of mortality (in both men and women) and fracture (in women), but the opposite was found for other dairy products, such as soured milk and yogurt, which would go along with the galactose theory, because the bacteria in these foods can ferment away some of the lactose.30

The medical journal editorial accompanying the published study emphasized that, given the rise in milk consumption around the world, the “role of milk in mortality needs to be established definitively now.”

//***********************************
Eggs, Choline, and Cancer

More than two million men are currently living with prostate cancer, but living with prostate cancer is better than dying from it. If the cancer is caught while still localized within the prostate, the chances of it killing you within the next five years are practically nil. However, if the cancer spreads far enough, your chances of surviving five years may be as low as one in three.32 For this reason, scientists have been desperate to identify factors involved in the spread of prostate cancer once it has emerged.

Hoping to identify possible culprits, Harvard University researchers recruited more than one thousand men with early-stage prostate cancer and followed them for several years. Compared with men who rarely ate eggs, men who ate even less than a single egg a day appeared to have twice the risk of prostate cancer progression, such as metastasizing into the bones. The only thing potentially worse for prostate cancer than eggs was poultry: Men with more aggressive cancer who regularly ate chicken and turkey had up to four times the risk of prostate cancer progression.33

The researchers suggested that the link between consuming poultry and advancing cancer may be due to cooked-meat carcinogens (such as heterocyclic amines as discussed in chapter 11). For unknown reasons, these carcinogens build up more in the muscles of chickens and turkeys than in those of other animals.34

But what cancer-promoting substance is there in eggs? How could eating less than an egg a day double the risk of cancer invasion? The answer may be choline, a compound found concentrated in eggs.35

Higher levels of choline in the blood have been associated with increased risk of developing prostate cancer in the first place.36 This may explain the link between eggs and cancer progression.37 But what about cancer mortality? In a paper entitled “Choline Intake and Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer,” the same Harvard team found that men who consumed the most choline from food also had an increased risk of cancer death.38 Men who consume two and a half or more eggs per week—basically an egg every three days—may have an 81 percent increased risk of dying from prostate cancer.39 The choline in eggs, like the carnitine in red meat, is converted into a toxin called trimethylamine40 by bacteria that exist in the guts of those who eat meat.41 And trimethylamine, once oxidized in the liver, appears to increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and premature death.42

Ironically, the presence of choline in eggs is something the egg industry boasts about even though most Americans get more than enough choline.43 Mind you, the industry executives are aware of the cancer connection. Through the Freedom of Information Act, I was able to get my hands on an e-mail from the executive director of the Egg Nutrition Board directed to another egg industry executive that discussed the Harvard study suggesting that choline is a culprit in promoting cancer progression. “Certainly worth keeping in mind,” he wrote, “as we continue to promote choline as another good reason to consume eggs.”


//********************* The blood of people eating plant-based diets was shown to fight cancer about eight times better. **************************

Diet Versus Exercise

Nathan Pritikin, the man who helped launch a lifestyle medicine revolution—and saved my grandma’s life—wasn’t a nutritionist or a dietitian. He wasn’t even a doctor. He was an engineer. When he was diagnosed with heart disease in his forties, Pritikin reviewed all the available research himself and decided to try eating the type of diet followed by populations in places like rural Africa, where heart disease was rare. He figured that if he stopped eating a heart-disease-promoting diet, he could stop the advancement of the disease. What he found was even more remarkable. He didn’t just stop the disease from getting worse, he reversed his condition.45 He then went on to help thousands of others do the same.

After vanquishing our number-one killer, heart disease, Dr. Dean Ornish and Pritikin Research Foundation researchers moved on to killer number two: cancer. They developed an elegant series of experiments, placing people on different diets and then dripping their blood on human cancer cells growing in a petri dish. Whose bloodstream would be better at suppressing cancer growth?

The research showed that the blood of people randomized to a plant-based-diet group was dramatically less hospitable to cancer-cell growth than the blood of people in the control group who continued to eat their typical diet. The blood of those eating the standard American diet does fight cancer—if it didn’t, many of us would be dead!—but the blood of people eating plant-based diets was shown to fight cancer about eight times better.46

The blood of men on the standard American diet slowed down the rate of prostate cancer cell growth by 9 percent. Place men on a plant-based diet for a year, though, and the blood circulating within their bodies can suppress cancer cell growth by 70 percent—that’s nearly eight times the stopping power compared to a meat-centered menu.47 Similar studies have shown that women eating plant-based diets appear to strengthen their bodies’ defenses against breast cancer in just fourteen days (as detailed in chapter 11).48 It’s as if we’re a totally different person inside after eating and living healthfully for just a couple of weeks.

It should be noted that the strengthening of cancer defenses in all these studies involved eating a plant-based diet and exercising. For example, in the breast cancer study, the women were asked to walk thirty to sixty minutes a day. How, then, do we know it was the diet that made their blood more effective at suppressing cancer growth? To tease out the effects of diet and exercise, a UCLA research team compared three groups of men: a plant-based diet-and-exercise group, an exercise-only group, and a control group of sedentary people eating standard fare.49

The diet-and-exercise group had been following a plant-based diet for fourteen years, along with participating in moderate exercise, such as a daily walk. The exercise-only group eating the standard American diet, on the other hand, had spent about fifteen years exercising strenuously for an hour a day at the gym at least five times a week. The researchers wanted to know if people who exercise hard enough for long enough develop cancer-fighting abilities that rival that of strolling plant eaters.50

To find out, blood from each of the three groups was dripped onto human prostate cancer cells growing in a petri dish to see whose blood kicked more cancer butt. The blood of the control group wasn’t completely defenseless. Even if you’re a french fry–eating couch potato, your blood may still be able to kill off 1–2 percent of cancer cells. But the blood of those who exercised strenuously every weekday for fifteen years killed 2,000 percent more cancer cells than the control groups’. Fantastic results, but the blood of those in the plant-based diet-and-exercise group wiped out an astounding 4,000 percent more cancer cells than that of the first group. Clearly exercise alone had a dramatic effect, but at the end of the day, thousands of hours in the gym appeared to be no match for a plant-based diet.

//*******************************************8
Prostate Cancer Reversal Through Diet?

If a healthy diet can turn your bloodstream into a cancer-fighting machine, what about using it not just to prevent cancer but also to treat it? Other leading killers, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, can be prevented, arrested, and even reversed, so why not cancer?

To test this question, Dr. Ornish and his colleagues recruited ninety-three men with prostate cancer who had chosen not to undergo any conventional treatment. Prostate cancer can be so slow growing and the side effects of treatment so onerous that men diagnosed with it often choose to be placed in a medical holding pattern called “watchful waiting” or “expectant management.” Because the next step is often chemotherapy, radiation, and/or radical surgery that may leave men incontinent and impotent, doctors try to delay treatment as long as possible. And since these patients aren’t actively doing anything to treat the disease, they represent an ideal population in whom to investigate the power of diet and lifestyle interventions.

The prostate cancer patients were randomized into two groups: a control group that wasn’t given any diet or lifestyle advice beyond whatever their personal doctors told them to do, and a healthy-living group prescribed a strict plant-based diet centered around fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, along with other healthy lifestyle changes, such as walking for thirty minutes, six days a week.52

Cancer progression was tracked using PSA levels, a marker of prostate cancer growth inside the body. After a year, the control group’s PSA levels increased by 6 percent. That’s what cancer tends to do: grow over time. But among the healthy-living group, PSA levels decreased by 4 percent, suggesting an average shrinkage of their tumors.53 No surgery, no chemotherapy, no radiation—just eating and living healthfully.

Biopsies taken before and after the diet and lifestyle intervention showed that the expression of more than five hundred genes was affected. This was one of the first demonstrations that changing what you eat and how you live can affect you at a genetic level, in terms of which genes are switched on and off.54 Within a year after the study ended, the cancers in the patients in the control group grew so much that 10 percent of them were forced to undergo a radical prostatectomy,55 a surgery that involves the removal of the entire prostate gland and surrounding tissues. This treatment can lead not only to urinary incontinence (urine leakage) and impotence but to alterations in orgasmic function in approximately 80 percent of men undergoing the procedure.56 In contrast, none in the plant-based diet and lifestyle group ended up on the operating table.

How were the researchers able to convince a group of older men to basically eat a vegan diet for a year? They evidently delivered prepared meals to their homes.57 I guess the researchers figured men are so lazy they’ll just eat whatever is put in front of them—and it worked!

Now, how about in the real world? Realizing that doctors apparently can’t get most men with cancer to eat even a measly five servings of fruits and veggies daily,58 a group of researchers at the University of Massachusetts settled on just trying to change their A:V ratio, or the ratio of animal to vegetable proteins in their diets.59 Maybe just a reduction in meat and dairy and an increase in plant foods would be enough to put cancer into remission?

To test this, the researchers randomized prostate cancer patients into two groups, one group that attended classes on eating a more plant-based diet and a conventional-care group that received no dietary instruction. The healthy-eating advice group was able to drop their A:V ratio down to about 1:1, getting half their protein from plant sources. In contrast, the control group’s ratio stayed up around 3:1 animal-to-plant protein.60

Those on the half-vegan diet did appear to slow down the growth of their cancer. Their average PSA doubling time—an estimate of how fast their tumors may have been doubling in size—slowed from twenty-one months to fifty-eight months.61 In other words, the cancer kept growing, but even a part-time plant-based diet appeared to be able to significantly slow down their tumors’ expansion. It is worth noting, though, that Dr. Ornish and colleagues were able to demonstrate that a full-time plant-based diet allowed for an apparent reversal in cancer growth: The subjects’ PSA levels didn’t just rise more slowly, but they trended downward. Thus, the ideal animal-to-plant protein ratio may be closer to zero to one.

The Worst A and the Best V

What if there’s just no way Grandpa’s going vegan, leaving you with only half measures? What would be on the short list of foods for him to avoid, or to include, in his diet?

Based on the Harvard University prostate cancer progression and mortality data detailed above, eggs and poultry may be the worst offenders: Patients may face twice the cancer progression risk from eating less than a single egg per day and up to quadruple the risk from eating less than a single serving of chicken or turkey daily.62

On the other hand, if you were to add only one thing to your diet, consider cruciferous vegetables. Less than a single serving a day of broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, or kale may cut the risk of cancer progression by more than half.63

Watching your animal-to-plant protein ratio might be useful for cancer prevention in general. For example, the largest study ever performed on diet and bladder cancer—comprising nearly five hundred thousand people—found that an increase in animal protein consumption of just 3 percent was associated with a 15 percent increased risk of bladder cancer. On the other hand, an increase in plant protein intake of only 2 percent was associated with a 23 percent decreased cancer risk

Flaxseed for prostate cancer

Prostate cancer rates vary tremendously around the world. African Americans, for example, may have an incidence of clinically apparent prostate cancer that is some 30 times greater than that of Japanese men and 120 times greater than that of Chinese men. This discrepancy has been attributed in part to the higher amounts of animal protein and fat in Western diets.65 Another factor, though, may be the soy common in many Asian diets, which contains protective phytoestrogens called isoflavones.66

As detailed in chapter 11, the other major class of phytoestrogens is lignans, found throughout the plant kingdom but especially concentrated in flaxseeds. Higher levels of lignans tend to be found in the prostate fluids of populations of men with relatively low rates of prostate cancer,67 and lignans have also been shown to slow the growth of prostate cancer cells in a petri dish.68

Researchers decided to put lignans to the test by asking men with prostate cancer scheduled for prostate-removal surgery the following month to consume three tablespoons a day of flaxseed. After surgery, their tumors were examined. Within just those few weeks, the flaxseed consumption appeared to have lowered their cancer-cell proliferation rates, while at the same time increasing their rate of cancer-cell clearance.69

Even better, flaxseeds may also be able to prevent prostate cancer from advancing to that stage in the first place. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is a precancerous prostate lesion found during a biopsy; it is analogous to ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast. Those with PIN have a high risk for cancer to appear during subsequent biopsies—25–79 percent.70 Because men are repeatedly biopsied to monitor their condition, the procedures provide a perfect opportunity to see if a dietary intervention can keep these lesions from progressing to cancer.

After the first biopsies of their prostates came back PIN positive, fifteen men were asked to eat three tablespoons of flaxseed a day for the six months until their next biopsy. After that time, they showed a significant drop in PSA levels and biopsy cell-proliferation rates, suggesting that flaxseeds may indeed thwart the progression of prostate cancer. Two of the men saw their PSA levels drop to normal and didn’t even need a second biopsy.71

Bottom line: The evidence suggests that flaxseed is a safe, low-cost source of nutrition and may reduce tumor-proliferation rates.72 Why not give it a try? Just make sure to grind the flaxseeds first if you don’t buy them preground—otherwise, the seeds may pass right through your body undigested.

Enlarged Prostate

If a healthy diet can slow down the abnormal growth of prostate cancer cells, can it also slow down the abnormal growth of normal prostate cells? Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition characterized by enlargement of the prostate gland. In the United States, BPH affects millions of men73—as many as half of men by their fifties and 80 percent of men by their eighties.74 Because the male prostate surrounds the outlet from the bladder, it can obstruct the normal flow of urine if it grows too large. This obstruction can cause a weak or hesitant stream and inadequate emptying of the bladder, requiring frequent trips to the bathroom. The stagnant urine retained in the bladder can also become a breeding ground for infection.

Unfortunately, the problem only seems to get worse as the gland continues to grow. Billions of dollars have been spent on drugs and supplements, and millions of American men have undergone surgery for BPH.75 Surgical procedures involve a variety of Roto-Rooter techniques with innocent-sounding acronyms, such as TUMT, TUNA, and TURP. The Ts stand for transurethral—meaning going up the penis with an instrument called a resectoscope. TUMT stands for transurethral microwave thermotherapy, in which doctors basically tunnel up the penis using an antenna-like tool and burn out a shaft with microwaves.76 TUNA stands for transurethral needle ablation; here, a column is burned out with a pair of heated needles. And these are so-called minimally invasive techniques!77 The gold standard procedure is the TURP, wherein surgeons essentially use a loop of wire to core out the prostate. Side effects include “postoperative discomfort.”78 Ya think?!

There has to be a better way.

BPH is so common that most doctors may assume that it’s just an inevitable consequence of aging. But it wasn’t always so. In China in the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a medical college in Beijing reported that BPH affected not 80 percent of male patients but about eighty cases total over fifteen years. Both the historic rarity of BPH and prostate cancer in Japan and China have been attributed to the countries’ traditional plant-based diets.79

This idea was studied by the same Pritikin Foundation researchers who pitted the blood of individuals before and after a plant-based diet against the growth of prostate cancer cells. This time, they performed the same experiment on the type of normal prostate cells that grow to obstruct urine flow. Within just two weeks, those eating plant-based diets saw their blood acquire the ability to suppress the abnormal growth of noncancerous prostate cells too—and the effect didn’t seem to dissipate with time. The blood of those eating plant-based diets over the long term had the same beneficial effect for up to twenty-eight years straight. So it appears that as long as we continue to eat healthfully, prostate cell-growth rates will continue to go down and stay down.80

Some plants may be particularly prostate friendly. Research has found that flaxseeds can be used to treat BPH. Men given the equivalent of about three tablespoons of flaxseeds a day experienced relief comparable to that provided by commonly prescribed such drugs as Flomax or Proscar81—without the drugs’ side effects, such as lightheadedness or sexual dysfunction.

Is it possible to prevent BPH in the first place? Eating garlic and onions has been associated with significantly lower risk of BPH.82 In general, cooked vegetables may work better than raw ones, and legumes—beans, chickpeas, split peas, and lentils—have also been associated with lower risk.83 TVP, short for textured vegetable protein, is a soybean product often used in pasta sauces and veggie chili. I would recommend that type of TVP over the one used in urology, which stands for transurethral vaporization of the prostate.


//********************************************************************************
IGF-1

Why do people who live to be one hundred or older seem to escape cancer? As you age, your risk of developing and dying from cancer grows every year—until you hit eighty-five or ninety, when, interestingly, your cancer risk begins to drop.85 Indeed, if you don’t get cancer by a certain age, you may never get it. What accounts for this relative resistance to cancer among centenarians? It may have to do with a cancer-promoting growth hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).86

Each year, you are reborn. You create and destroy nearly your entire body weight in new cells every year. Every day, about fifty billion of your cells die, and about fifty billion new cells are born to keep you in balance.87 Of course, sometimes you need to grow, as when you’re a baby or during puberty. Your cells don’t become larger when you grow up; they simply become more numerous. An adult may have around forty trillion cells in his or her body, four times more than a child.

Once you’ve gotten through puberty, you no longer need to produce many more cells than you retire. You still need your cells to grow and divide, of course—out with the old, in with the new. You just don’t want to make more cells than you’re putting out to pasture. In adults, extra cell growth can mean the development of tumors.

How does your body keep itself in balance? By sending chemical signals called hormones to all the cells. A key signal is a growth hormone called IGF-1. It sounds like a droid from Star Wars, but IGF-1 is actually a crucial factor in regulating cell growth. Levels go up when you’re a kid in order to power your development, but when you reach adulthood, IGF-1 levels diminish. It’s your body’s cue to stop producing more cells than it kills off.

Should your levels of IGF-1 remain too high when you reach adulthood, however, your cells will constantly receive a message to grow, divide, and keep going and growing. Not surprisingly, the more IGF-1 you have in your bloodstream, the higher your risk for developing cancers, such as prostate cancer.88

There is a rare form of dwarfism called Laron syndrome that is caused by the body’s inability to produce IGF-1. Affected individuals grow to be only a few feet tall, but they also almost never get cancer.89 Laron syndrome is a sort of cancer-proofing mutation, which led scientists to wonder: What if you could get all the IGF-1 you needed as a child to grow to a normal height but then down-regulate this hormone as adults and thereby turn off excess growth signals? It turns out you can do just that—not with surgery or medication but through simple dietary choices.

The release of IGF-1 appears to be triggered by the consumption of animal protein.90 This may explain why you can so dramatically bolster the cancer-fighting power of your bloodstream within weeks of eating a plant-based diet. Remember the experiments in which dripping the blood from people eating healthy diets onto cancer cells wiped more of them out? Well, if you add back to the cancer cells the amount of IGF-1 that left the plant eaters’ systems, guess what happens? The diet-and-exercise effect disappears. The cancer cell growth comes surging back. This is how we suspect plant-based eating boosts our blood defenses: By reducing animal protein intake, we reduce our levels of IGF-1.91

After just eleven days of cutting back on animal protein, your IGF-1 levels can drop by 20 percent, and your levels of IGF-1 binding protein can jump by 50 percent.92 One of the ways your body tries to protect itself from cancer—that is, excessive growth—is by releasing a binding protein into your bloodstream to tie up any excess IGF-1. Think of it as the body’s emergency brake. Even if you’ve managed to down-regulate production of new IGF-1 through diet, what about all that excess IGF-1 still circulating from the bacon and eggs you may have eaten two weeks before? No problem: The liver releases a snatch squad of binding proteins to help take it out of circulation.

How plant focused does a diet have to be to lower IGF-1 levels? Animal protein stimulates IGF-1 production whether it’s the muscle proteins in meat, the egg-white protein in eggs, or the milk proteins in dairy. Vegetarians who include eggs and dairy in their diets don’t seem to achieve a significant reduction in IGF-1. Only men93 and women94 who limit their intake of all animal proteins appear able to significantly drop their levels of the cancer-promoting hormone and raise their levels of the protective binding proteins.

Prostate cancer isn’t inevitable. I once gave a speech in Bellport, New York, about preventing chronic disease through diet. Afterward, an audience member named John was inspired to e-mail me and recount his battle with prostate cancer. Diagnosed at age fifty-two, John had had six needle core biopsies performed, and each showed his cancer to be very aggressive. John’s doctors immediately recommended surgery to remove his entire prostate.

Instead of going under the knife, John decided to switch to a plant-based diet. Eight months later, he had another biopsy. His doctors were astonished to see that only 10 percent of his cancer remained. What’s more, his PSA tests have been completely normal ever since.

John was diagnosed in 1996. After changing his diet, his cancer went away and has stayed away.

John may have just gotten lucky, though. I do not recommend that people ignore their doctors’ advice. Whatever you and your medical team decide together, healthy diet and lifestyle changes can presumably only help. That’s the nice thing about lifestyle interventions—they can be implemented in addition to whatever other treatment options are chosen. In a research setting, that can complicate matters, as you don’t know which action may be responsible for any improvement. But when facing a cancer diagnosis, you may want to opt for all the help you can get. Regardless of whether cancer patients elect for chemo, surgery, or radiation, they can always improve their diets. A prostate-healthy diet is a breast-healthy diet is a heart-healthy diet is a body-healthy diet.

CHAPTER 14

How Not to Die from Parkinson’s Disease

Back in the 1960s at the height of the civil rights movement, my dad was dodging bullets during the Brooklyn riots and setting up shots at just the right angle to best capture images of my mother being arrested at protests and dragged away again and again. His most famous work—one of Esquire’s 1963 Photos of the Year—depicted family friend Mineral Bramletter suspended in a Christlike pose between two white police officers as another cop clutched his throat.

What a cruel twist of fate that a celebrated photojournalist got a disease that caused his hands to shake. For years, my dad suffered at the hands of Parkinson’s. Slowly and all too painfully, he lost the ability to take care of himself, to live his life in any semblance of the way he had before. He became bedridden and compromised in every way imaginable.

After sixteen years of fighting, he went to the hospital one last time. As so often happens with chronic disease, one complication led to another. He got pneumonia and spent his last few weeks on a ventilator, suffering through a painful, prolonged death. The weeks he spent in that hospital bed before he passed were the worst weeks of both his and my life.

Hospitals are terrible places to be and terrible places to die. That is why each of us needs to take care of ourselves.

As my father’s story shows, Parkinson’s can end badly. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s. Parkinson’s is a disabling disorder affecting the speed, quality, and ease of movement. Its hallmark symptoms, which worsen as the disease progresses, include hand tremors, limb stiffness, impaired balance, and difficulty walking. It can also affect mood, thinking, and sleep. Parkinson’s is not currently curable.

The disease is caused by the die-off of specialized nerve cells in a region of the brain that controls movement. It typically presents after age fifty. A history of head trauma can increase risk,1 which may be why heavyweight boxers, including Muhammad Ali, and NFL players, including Hall of Famer Forrest Gregg, have fallen victim to the condition. However, most people may be more likely to develop the disease from toxic pollutants in our environment that can build up in the food supply and eventually affect the brain.

The National Cancer Institute’s 2008/2009 U.S. Presidential Cancer Panel report discussed the degree to which we’re being inundated with industrial chemicals. It concluded:

The American people—even before they are born—are bombarded continually with myriad combinations of these dangerous exposures. The Panel urges you [Mr. President] most strongly to use the power of your office to remove the carcinogens and other toxins from our food, water, and air that needlessly increase health care costs, cripple our Nation’s productivity, and devastate American lives.2

In addition to increasing your risk of developing many cancers, industrial pollutants may also play a role in the onset of such brain-deteriorating (neurodegenerative) diseases as Parkinson’s.3 And those toxins are residing in most peoples’ bodies.

Every few years, the CDC measures the levels of chemical pollutants in the bodies of thousands of Americans from across the country. According to the agency’s findings, the bodies of most women in the United States are contaminated with heavy metals, along with a number of toxic solvents, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, fire retardants, chemicals from plastics, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and banned pesticides such as DDT4 (publicized by American biologist Rachel Carson in her 1962 bestseller Silent Spring).

In many cases, 99–100 percent of the hundreds of women tested were found to have detectable levels of these pollutants circulating in their bloodstreams. Pregnant women were found to harbor, on average, up to fifty different chemicals.5 Could the presence of these potential toxicants in their bodies mean that they’re also being passed on to their children? Researchers decided to put that question to the test by measuring pollutant levels right at delivery in the babies’ umbilical cord blood. (As soon as the cord is cut, a little blood can be squirted into a vial.) After studying more than three hundred women who had recently given birth, researchers found that 95 percent of umbilical cord samples showed detectable DDT residues.6 And this is now decades after the pesticide was banned.

What about men? Men tend to have even higher levels of certain pollutants than women. A clue to solving this mystery was found when breast-feeding history was taken into account. Women who never breast-fed had about the same level of certain toxicants in their bodies as men, but the longer they breast-fed their children, the lower their levels fell, suggesting that they were detoxing themselves by passing the pollution down to their children.7

It appears that blood levels of some pollutants in women may drop by nearly half during pregnancy,8 in part because their bodies pass them off through the placenta.9 That may be why breast milk concentrations of pollutants appear higher after the first pregnancy than in subsequent ones.10 This could explain why birth order was found to be a significant predictor of pollutant levels in young people. Basically, firstborn kids may get first dibs on mom’s store of toxic waste, leaving less for their baby brothers and sisters.11

Even mothers who were breast-fed as infants themselves tend to have higher levels of pollutants in their own breast milk when they grow up, suggesting a multigenerational passing down of these chemicals.12 In other words, what you eat now may affect the levels of toxic chemicals in your grandchildren. When it comes to feeding babies, breast is still best—absolutely13—but rather than detoxing into our children, we should strive not to “tox” ourselves in the first place.

In 2012, researchers from the University of California–Davis, published an analysis of the diets of California kids aged two to seven. (Children are thought to be especially vulnerable to chemicals in the diet because they are still growing, and thus they have a comparatively greater intake of food and fluids relative to their weight.) Chemicals and heavy metals in children’s bodies from the foods they ate were indeed found to exceed safety levels by a larger margin than in adults. Cancer risk ratios, for instance, were exceeded by a factor of up to one hundred or more. For every child studied, benchmark levels were surpassed for arsenic, the banned pesticide dieldrin, and potentially highly toxic industrial by-products called dioxins. They were also too high for DDE, a by-product of DDT.14

Which foods contributed the most heavy metals? The number-one food source of arsenic was poultry among preschoolers and, for their parents, tuna.15 The top source for lead? Dairy. For mercury? Seafood.16

Those concerned about exposing their children to mercury-containing vaccines should know that eating just a single serving of fish each week during pregnancy can lead to more mercury in their infant’s body than injecting them directly with about a dozen mercury-containing vaccines.17 You should strive to minimize mercury exposure, but the benefits of vaccination far exceed the risks. The same cannot be said for tuna.18

Where in the food supply are these pollutants found? Today, most DDT comes from meat, particularly fish.19 The oceans are essentially humanity’s sewer; everything eventually flows into the sea. The same is true when it comes to dietary exposure to PCBs—another set of banned chemicals, once widely used as insulating fluid in electrical equipment. A study of more than twelve thousand food and feed samples across eighteen countries found that the highest PCB contamination was found in fish and fish oil, followed by eggs, dairy, and then other meats. The lowest contamination was found at the bottom of the food chain, in plants.20

Hexachlorobenzene, another pesticide banned nearly a half century ago, today may be found mainly in dairy and meat, including fish.21 Perfluorochemicals, or PFCs? Overwhelmingly found in fish and other meats.22 As for dioxins, in the United States, the most concentrated sources may be butter, followed by eggs, and then processed meat.23 The levels in eggs may help explain why one study found that eating more than half an egg a day was associated with about two to three times higher odds for cancers of the mouth, colon, bladder, prostate, and breast compared to those who didn’t eat eggs at all.24

If women want to clean up their diets before conception, how long does it take for these pollutants to leave their systems? To find out, researchers asked people to eat one large serving a week of tuna or other high-mercury fish for fourteen weeks to boost their levels of the heavy metal and then stop. By measuring how fast the subjects’ mercury levels dropped, the scientists were able to calculate the half-life of mercury in the body.25 The subjects appeared to be able to clear about half the mercury from their bodies within two months. This result suggests that within a year of stopping fish consumption, the body can detox nearly 99 percent of it. Unfortunately, other industrial pollutants in fish can take longer for our bodies to get rid of; the half-lives for certain dioxins, PCBs, and DDT by-products found in fish are as long as ten years.26 So to get that same 99 percent drop, it could take more than a century—a long time to delay having your first child.

By now you are probably wondering how these chemicals get into your food in the first place. One reason is that we’ve so thoroughly polluted our planet that the chemicals can just come down in the rain. For example, scientists have reported eight different pesticides contaminating the snow-packed peaks of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.27 Once pollutants get into the soil, they can work their way up the food chain at increasing concentrations. Consider that before she’s slaughtered for meat, a dairy cow may eat seventy-five thousand pounds’ worth of plants. The chemicals in the plants can get stored in her fat and build up in her body. So when it comes to many of the fat-soluble pesticides and pollutants, every time you eat a burger, you are, in effect, eating everything that burger ate. The best way to minimize your exposure to industrial toxins may be to eat as low as possible on the food chain, a plant-based diet.

//*********************************************************
Reducing Dioxin Intake

Dioxins are highly toxic pollutants that accumulate in the fat of animal tissue, such that about 95 percent of human exposure comes from eating animal products.28 Sometimes that’s because of contaminated animal feed. In the 1990s, for example, a supermarket survey found that the highest concentration of dioxins was found in farm-raised catfish.29 Apparently, the catfish were provided feed mixed with an anticaking agent laced with dioxins that may have originated from sewage sludge.30

That same feed was given to chickens, affecting approximately 5 percent of U.S. poultry production at the time.31 That would mean that people ate hundreds of millions of contaminated chickens.32 Of course, if it was in the chickens, then it was also in their eggs. Indeed, elevated dioxins levels were found in U.S. eggs too.33 The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that less than 1 percent of feed was contaminated, but 1 percent of egg production would mean more than a million tainted eggs per day. But the catfish contamination was even more widespread: More than one-third of all U.S. farm-raised catfish tested were found to be contaminated with dioxins.34

In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration called on feed manufacturers to stop using these dioxin-tainted ingredients, stating that “[c]ontinued exposure to elevated dioxin levels in animal feed increases the risk of adverse health effects in animals and to humans consuming animal-derived food products.”35 So did the feed industry clean up their act? Up to a half billion pounds of catfish continued to be churned out of U.S. fish farms every year,36 but it wasn’t until more than a decade later that our government went back and checked for compliance. Researchers from the USDA tested samples of catfish from all over the country and in 2013 reported that 96 percent of tested samples still contained dioxins or dioxin-like compounds. And when they checked the feed used to raise these fish? More than half the samples came back as contaminated.37

In other words, the feed industry has known for more than two decades that what they were feeding to animals (and, ultimately, to most of us38) may contain dioxins, but apparently, they continue this practice unabated.

The Institute of Medicine has made suggestions for reducing dioxin exposure, such as trimming fat from meat, including from poultry and fish, and avoiding the recycling of animal fat into gravy.39 Wouldn’t it be more prudent just to trim the amount of animal foods from your diet instead? Researchers have estimated that a plant-based diet could wipe out about 98 percent of your dioxin intake.

//**************************************************
Smoking and Parkinson’s Disease

The CDC recently celebrated the fifty-year anniversary of the landmark 1964 surgeon general’s report on smoking, considered one of the great public health achievements of our time.41 It’s interesting to go back and read the reactions of the tobacco industry to such reports. For example, an industry insider argued that contrary to the surgeon general’s argument that smoking costs our nation billions, “smoking saves the country money by increasing the number of people dying soon after retirement.”42 In other words, just think how much we’re saving on Medicare and Social Security thanks to cigarettes.

The tobacco industry also criticized the surgeon general’s “lack of balance regarding benefits of smoking.”43 As they testified before Congress, these “positive health benefits” include “the feeling of well-being, satisfaction, and happiness and everything else.” Beyond all that happiness the surgeon general was trying to extinguish, the Tobacco Institute argued, “everything else” included protection against Parkinson’s disease.44

As it happens, quite unexpectedly, more than five dozen studies over the past half century have collectively shown that smoking tobacco is indeed associated with significantly lower incidence of Parkinson’s disease.45 Valiant attempts have failed to explain away these findings. Maybe, public health scientists countered, it’s because smokers are dying off before they get Parkinson’s. No, smoking appears protective at all ages.46 Maybe it’s because smokers drink more coffee, which we know to be protective.47 No, the protective effect remained even after researchers controlled studies for coffee intake.48 Identical-twin studies helped rule out genetic factors in the link.49 Even simply growing up in a home where your parents smoked appears protective when it comes to developing Parkinson’s.50 So was the tobacco industry right? Does it even matter?

Since the surgeon general’s groundbreaking 1964 report, more than twenty million Americans have died as a result of smoking.51 Even if you didn’t care about dying from lung cancer or emphysema, even if you cared only about protecting your brain, you still shouldn’t smoke, because smoking is a significant risk factor for stroke.52 But what if you could get the benefits of smoking without the risks?

Maybe you can. The neuroprotective agent in tobacco appears to be nicotine.53 Tobacco is part of the nightshade family, the group of plants that includes tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers. It turns out they all contain nicotine, too, but in such trace amounts—hundreds of times less than what’s found in a single cigarette—that the protective potential of vegetables was dismissed as inconsequential.54 But then it was discovered that just one to two puffs of a cigarette can saturate half of your brain’s nicotine receptors.55 Then we learned that even exposure to secondhand smoke may lower the risk of Parkinson’s56 and that the amount of nicotine exposure sitting in a smoky restaurant is on the same order as what you might get from eating a healthy meal in a smoke-free restaurant.57 So might eating lots of nightshade vegetables protect you from Parkinson’s after all?

Researchers at the University of Washington decided to find out. When they tested for nicotine, they found none in eggplants, just a little in potatoes, some in tomatoes, and more significant amounts in bell peppers. These results were consistent with what researchers found when they studied nearly five hundred newly diagnosed Parkinson’s patients compared to controls. Eating nicotine-rich vegetables, especially peppers, was associated with significantly lower risk of Parkinson’s disease.58 (This effect was found only in the nonsmokers, which makes sense because the flood of nicotine from cigarettes would likely overwhelm any dietary effect.) This study may help explain previous protective associations in terms of Parkinson’s risk that had been tenuously found for tomato and potato consumption, as well as for the nightshade-rich Mediterranean diet.59

The University of Washington researchers concluded that more research is needed before individuals should consider dietary interventions to prevent Parkinson’s disease, but when that intervention is simply enjoying more healthy dishes like stuffed peppers with tomato sauce, I don’t see a reason why you should have to wait.

//*************************
Dairy

Parkinson’s patients have been found to have elevated levels of an organochlorine pesticide in their bloodstreams, the class of largely banned pesticides that includes DDT.60 Autopsy studies have also found elevated levels of pesticides in the brain tissue of those with Parkinson’s.61 Elevated levels of other pollutants like PCBs were also found in their brains, and the higher certain PCB concentrations, the higher the degree of damage found specifically in the brain region thought to be responsible for the disease, called the substantia nigra.62 As noted earlier, though many of these chemicals were banned decades ago, they may persist in the environment. You can continue to be exposed to them through the consumption of contaminated animal products in your diet, including dairy.63 Indeed, people who eat dairy-free, plant-based diets were found to have significantly lower blood levels of the PCBs implicated in the development of Parkinson’s disease.64

A meta-analysis of studies involving more than three hundred thousand participants found that overall dairy consumption was associated with significantly increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. They estimated that Parkinson’s risk may increase 17 percent for every daily cup of milk consumed.65 “Contamination of milk with neurotoxins may be of critical importance,” researchers offered by way of explanation.66 For example, neurotoxic chemicals like tetrahydroisoquinoline, a compound used to induce parkinsonism in primates in laboratory studies,67 appears to be found predominantly in cheese.68 The concentrations found were low, but the concern is that they may accumulate over a lifetime of consumption,69 resulting in the elevated levels found in the brains of Parkinson’s patients.70 There have been calls on the dairy industry to require screening of milk for such toxins,71 but they have so far gone unanswered.

A recent nutrition journal editorial considered the case closed: “The only possible explanation for this effect is the evidence of the contamination of milk by neurotoxins.”72 But there are alternate explanations for the “clear-cut” link between dairy and Parkinson’s.73 For example, pollutant levels wouldn’t explain why Parkinson’s appears more closely tied to the consumption of the milk sugar lactose than to milk fat,74 more closely tied to milk than to butter.75 So maybe the culprit is galactose, the sugar in milk described in chapter 13, blamed for an increased risk of bone fractures, cancer, and death.76 Those with an inability to detoxify the galactose in milk not only suffer damage to their bones but also to their brains.77 This may help explain the link between milk intake and Parkinson’s, as well as the link between milk and another neurodegenerative disease called Huntington’s disease. Indeed, higher consumption of dairy products appears to double the risk of earlier-onset Huntington’s.78

Another explanation is that milk consumption lowers blood levels of uric acid, an important brain antioxidant79 shown to protect nerve cells against the oxidative stress caused by pesticides.80 Uric acid may slow the progression of Huntington’s81 and Parkinson’s,82 and, most importantly, may lower the risk of getting Parkinson’s in the first place.83 Too much uric acid, however, can crystallize in your joints and cause a painful disease called gout, so uric acid can be thought of as a double-edged sword.84 Too much uric acid is also associated with heart disease and kidney disease; too little, with Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.85 Those on dairy-free, plant-based diets appear to hit the sweet spot86 in terms of most optimal uric acid levels for longevity.87

Milk may not do a body good, at least when it comes to your bones and brain.

Plant-Based Diets and Pollutants

As we’ve discussed, organochlorines are a group of chemicals that includes dioxins, PCBs, and such insecticides as DDT. Although most were banned decades ago, they persist in the environment and creep up the food chain into the fat of the animals people eat.

What if you don’t eat any animal products at all? Researchers have “found that vegans were significantly less polluted than omnivores” when measuring levels of organochlorines in their blood, including a variety of PCBs and one of Monsanto’s long-banned Aroclor compounds.88 This finding is consistent with studies showing higher levels of organochlorine pesticides in the body fat89 and breast milk90 of those who eat meat.

People eating completely plant-based diets have also been found to have markedly lower levels of dioxins in their bodies91 as well as decreased contamination with PBDEs,92 the flame-retardant chemical pollutants also linked to neurological problems.93 No surprise: The highest levels of flame retardants in the U.S. food supply have been found in fish, though the primary source of intake for most Americans is poultry, followed by processed meat.94 This discovery helps explain the significantly lower levels of PBDEs in the bodies of those eating meat-free diets.95 It appears that the more plant-based foods you eat and the longer you go without eating animal products, the lower your levels fall.96 No regulatory limits have been set for PBDEs in food, but as U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers noted in a survey of flame-retardant chemicals in domestic meat and poultry, “reducing the levels of unnecessary, persistent, toxic compounds in food and your diet is certainly desirable.”97

Eating healthier can also reduce the concentrations of heavy metals in your body. The levels of mercury in the hair of those eating plant-based diets were found to be up to ten times lower than of those who ate fish.98 Within three months of switching to a plant-based diet, the levels of mercury, lead, and cadmium growing out in your hair appear to drop significantly (but build back up when meat and eggs are added back into the diet).99 Unlike heavy metals, though, some organochlorine pollutants can stick around for decades.100 Any DDT in your KFC may stay with you for the rest of your life.

Berries

Dr. James Parkinson, in his original, centuries-old description of the disease that bears his name, described a characteristic feature: “torpid” bowels, or constipation that may precede the diagnosis by many years.101 We’ve since learned that bowel-movement frequency may even be predictive of Parkinson’s. Men with less than daily bowel movements, for instance, were found to be four times more likely to develop the disease years later.102 Reverse causation has been suggested: Maybe constipation didn’t lead to Parkinson’s. Maybe Parkinson’s—even decades before it was diagnosed—led to constipation. This idea was supported by anecdotal evidence suggesting that throughout their lives, many who would go on to develop Parkinson’s reported never feeling very thirsty and, perhaps, decreased water intake contributed to their constipation.103

Alternatively, given the link between dietary pollutants and Parkinson’s, constipation may be contributing directly to the disease: the longer feces stay in the bowel, the more neurotoxic chemicals in the diet may be absorbed.104 There are now more than one hundred studies linking pesticides to an increased risk for Parkinson’s disease,105 but many of them are based on subjects’ occupational or ambient exposure. Approximately one billion pounds of pesticides are applied annually in the United States,106 and simply living or working in high-spray areas may increase your risk.107 The use of common household pesticides like bug sprays is also associated with significantly increased risk.108

How exactly do pesticides increase your risk for Parkinson’s? Scientists think they may cause DNA mutations that increase your susceptibility109 or affect the way certain proteins fold in your brain. In order for proteins to function effectively, they have to be the right shape. As you make new proteins in your cells, if they come out folded incorrectly, they are simply recycled, and your body tries again. Certain misfolded proteins, however, can take a shape that your body has difficulty breaking down. Should this glitch happen continuously, the malformed proteins can accumulate and result in the death of the brain’s nerve cells. Misfolded beta amyloid proteins, for example, are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (see chapter 3); misfolded prion proteins cause mad cow disease, a different malformed protein causes Huntington’s; and misfolded alpha synuclein proteins can lead to Parkinson’s disease.110 In the most comprehensive study of this sort to date, eight out of twelve common pesticides tested were able to trigger the accumulation of alpha synuclein proteins in human nerve cells in a petri dish.111

As I’ve said, Parkinson’s disease is caused by the die-off of specialized nerve cells in a region of the brain that controls movement. By the time the first symptoms arise, 70 percent of these critical cells may already be dead.112 Pesticides are so good at killing these neurons that scientists often use pesticides in the laboratory to try to re-create Parkinson’s in animals to test new treatments.113

If pesticides are killing off your brain cells, is there anything you can do to stop the process other than lowering your exposure to them? There are no known drugs that can prevent these misfolded proteins from accumulating, but certain phytonutrients called flavonoids—which are found in fruits and vegetables—may have protective effects. Researchers tested forty-eight different plant compounds able to cross the blood-brain barrier to see if any were able to stop alpha synuclein proteins from clumping together. To their surprise, not only did a variety of flavonoids inhibit these proteins from accumulating but they could also break up existing deposits.114

This study suggests that by eating healthfully, you can reduce your exposure to pollutants while countering their effects at the same time. And when it comes to countering the effects of pesticides, berries may be particularly useful. In a head-to-head battle between pesticides and berries, researchers found that preincubating nerve cells with a blueberry extract allowed them to better withstand the debilitating effects of a common pesticide.115 But most such studies were performed on cells in a petri dish. Is there any evidence in people that eating berries could make a difference?

A small study published decades ago suggested that the consumption of blueberries and strawberries might protect against Parkinson’s,116 but the question remained largely unanswered until a Harvard University study of about 130,000 people found that people who eat more berries do indeed appear to have a significantly lower risk of developing the disease.117

The editorial that accompanied the study in the journal Neurology concluded that more research is necessary, but “until then, an apple a day might be a good idea.”118 Apples did appear protective against Parkinson’s, but only for men. Everyone, however, appeared to benefit from the consumption of blueberries and strawberries, the only berries included in the study.119

If you do decide to follow my recommendation to eat berries every day, I would advise not serving them with cream. Not only has dairy been shown to block some of the beneficial effects of berries,120 but, as we saw earlier, dairy products may contain compounds that cause the very damage the berries may be trying to undo.

Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification

If people just eat from the bottom two levels of the food chain, only plants and plant eaters—that is, cows, pigs, and chickens fed grain and soybeans—why is the American populace so contaminated? Those of you who remember the mad cow disease story may know the answer. In modern agribusiness, there are essentially no more herbivores.

Millions of tons of slaughterhouse by-products continue to be fed to farm animals in the United States every year.121 Not only have we turned these animals into meat eaters but virtual cannibals as well. When we feed farm animals millions of tons of meat and bonemeal, we’re also feeding them any pollutants this feed may contain. Then, after those animals are slaughtered, their trimmings go to feed the next generation of farm animals, potentially concentrating the pollutant levels higher and higher.122 So we can end up like polar bears or eagles at the top of the food chain and suffer the biomagnified pollutant consequences. When we eat these farmed animals, it’s almost as if we’re also eating every animal they ate.

The use of slaughterhouse by-products in animal feed can recycle both toxic heavy metals and industrial chemicals back into the food supply. Lead accumulates in animal bones and mercury in animal protein123 (which is why egg whites contain up to twenty times more mercury than do yolks).124 Persistent lipophilic organic pollutants (known as PLOPs125—really!) build up in animal fat. Reducing meat consumption can help reduce exposure, but these contaminants can come back to us in a variety of animal products. “Although a vegetarian lifestyle can lower the body burden of PLOP, MMHg [mercury], and lead,” one toxicologist noted, “such benefits can be undermined by the consumption of contaminated milk and egg products. Farm animals that have been fed contaminated animal products produce contaminated milk and egg products.”126

If you want to drop your PLOP, eat as low as possible on the food chain.


//*************
Coffee for Preventing and Treating Parkinson’s Disease

Could your cup of morning joe help prevent and perhaps even help treat one of our most crippling neurodegenerative conditions? It appears so.

There have been at least nineteen studies performed on the role coffee may play in Parkinson’s, and overall, coffee consumption is associated with about one-third lower risk.127 The key ingredient appears to be the caffeine, since tea also seems protective128 and decaf coffee does not.129 Like the berry phytonutrients, caffeine has been shown to protect human nerve cells in a petri dish from being killed by a pesticide and other neurotoxins.130

What about coffee for treating Parkinson’s? In a randomized controlled trial, giving Parkinson’s patients the caffeine equivalent of two cups of coffee a day (or approximately four cups of black tea or eight cups of green tea) significantly improved movement symptoms within three weeks.131

Of course, there’s only so much you can charge for a cup of coffee, so drug companies have tried to tweak caffeine into new experimental drugs, such as preladenant and istradefylline. But it turns out they don’t appear to work any better than plain coffee, which is far cheaper and has a better safety record.132

There are a number of simple things you can do that may decrease your risk of dying from Parkinson’s disease. You can wear seat belts and bicycle helmets to avoid getting hit in the head, you can exercise regularly,133 avoid becoming overweight,134 consume peppers, berries, and green tea, and minimize your exposure to pesticides, heavy metals, and dairy and other animal products. It’s worth it. Trust me when I say that no family should have to endure the tragedy of Parkinson’s.


//************ Informed decision *******************
Using content analysis, we examined the completeness of informed decision making between physicians and their patients. We adapted methods from an approach described in our previous work.16 The intent of our method is to evaluate the completeness of informed decision making using preestablished and valid criteria. The criteria for informed decision making used in this study include 7 distinct elements (Table 1): (1) the patient's role in decision making, (2) the nature of the decision, (3) alternatives, (4) pros (benefits) and cons (risks) of the alternatives, (5) uncertainties associated with the decision, (6) an assessment of the patient's understanding of the decision, and (7) an exploration of the patient's preferences. These criteria represent a synthesis of the bioethics literature and professional consensus on important elements of informed decision making.

How Not to Die from Iatrogenic Causes (or, How Not to Die from Doctors)

As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. That’s quaint, but a pound isn’t all that heavy. Why change your diet and lifestyle when you can just let modern medicine do its job of fixing you back up?

Unfortunately, modern medicine isn’t nearly as effective as most people think.1 Doctors excel at treating acute conditions, such as mending broken bones and curing infections, but for chronic diseases, which are the leading causes of death and disability, conventional medicine doesn’t have much to offer and, in fact, can sometimes do more harm than good.

For example, side effects from medications given in hospitals kill an estimated 106,000 Americans every year.2 That statistic alone effectively makes medical care the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. And this number reflects only the number of deaths from taking the drugs as prescribed. An additional 7,000 people die every year from receiving the wrong medication by mistake, and 20,000 others die from other hospital errors.3 Hospitals are dangerous places, and that’s not even counting the estimated 99,000 deaths each year due to hospital-acquired infections.4 But can deaths from infections be blamed on doctors? They can if doctors won’t even wash their hands.

We’ve known since the 1840s that hand washing is the best way to prevent hospital-acquired infections, yet compliance among health care workers rarely exceeds 50 percent. And doctors are the worst offenders.5 One study found that even in a medical intensive care unit, slapping up a “contact precautions” sign (signaling particularly high risk of infection) leads less than a quarter of doctors to properly wash their hands or use a hand sanitizer when treating patients.6 That’s right. Not even one doctor out of four washed his or her hands before laying them on the ill. Many physicians are concerned that should it become widely known how many people doctors inadvertently kill every year, it could “undermine public trust.”7 But if doctors can’t even be bothered to wash their hands, how much trust do we deserve?

This unfortunate (and gross!) situation means that you could go in for a simple operation and come out with a life-threatening infection—if you come out at all. Every year, 12,000 Americans die from complications due to surgeries that weren’t even necessary in the first place. For those keeping score, that’s more than 200,000 people dead from so-called iatrogenic causes (from the Ancient Greek iatrós, meaning “doctor”). And that figure is based only on the data on hospitalized patients. In outpatient settings—for instance, at your doctor’s office—prescription drug side effects alone may result in 199,000 additional deaths.8

The Institute of Medicine estimates that medical errors may kill even more Americans, up to 98,000,9 bringing the total annual death count closer to 300,000. That’s more than the entire population of cities like Newark, Buffalo, or Orlando. Even using more conservative estimates of deaths due to medical errors, health care comes in as the real third-leading cause of death in America.10

How did the medical community respond to such damning conclusions? Deafening silence in both word and deed.11 The first such report, which appeared in 1978, suggested that about 120,000 deaths occurring in hospitals could be prevented.12 Then, sixteen years later, another scathing reminder was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggesting the iatrogenic death toll may be “the equivalent of three jumbo-jet crashes every 2 days.”13 In the years between these two reports, as many as nearly two million Americans may have died due to medical errors, yet the medical community refused to comment on this tragedy and made no substantial effort to reduce the number of deaths.14 Another estimated 600,000 deaths later, the prestigious Institute of Medicine released its own landmark report on the catastrophic consequences of medical error15—but again, little was done as a result.16

Eventually, a few changes were implemented. For instance, interns and residents could no longer be made to work for more than eighty hours a week (at least on paper), and shifts couldn’t be more than thirty consecutive hours long. That may not sound like a big step, but when I started my internship after graduating from medical school, we worked thirty-six-hour shifts every three days—combined with our other days of work, that added up to a 117-hour work week. When interns and residents are forced to pull all-nighters, studies suggest they may make 36 percent more serious medical errors, five times more diagnostic errors, and have twice as many “attentional failures” (such as nodding off during surgery).17 The patient is supposed to be asleep during surgery, not the surgeon. It’s no surprise, then, that overworked doctors may cause 300 percent more fatigue-related medical errors that lead to patient death.18

If every single day airliners crashed and killed hundreds of people, we would expect the Federal Aviation Administration to step in and do something. Why doesn’t anyone confront the medical profession? Instead of just releasing reports, entities like the Institute of Medicine could have demanded that doctors and hospitals adopt at least a minimum set of preventive practices, such as bar-coding drugs to avoid mix-ups.19 (You know, something they do even on a package of Twinkies at the grocery store.)

Only people on medications are killed by medication errors or the drugs’ side effects, though. You have to actually be in the hospital to be killed by a hospital error or get an infection there. The good news is that most visits to doctors are for diseases that can be prevented with a healthy diet and lifestyle.20

The best way to avoid the adverse effects of medical tests and treatments is not to avoid doctors but to avoid getting sick in the first place.

Radiation

There are risks associated not only with medical treatment but also sometimes with diagnosis. A paper entitled “Estimated Risks of Radiation-Induced Fatal Cancer from Pediatric CT” out of Columbia University in 2001 reignited long-standing concerns about the risks associated with medical diagnostic radiation exposure. CT, or CAT, scans use multiple x-rays from different angles to create cross-sectional images, exposing the body to hundreds of times more radiation than a simple x-ray.21 Based on the excess cancer risk of Hiroshima survivors exposed to similar doses of radiation,22 it was estimated that out of all children who undergo abdominal or head CT scans every year, five hundred “might ultimately die from cancer attributable to the CT radiation.”23 In response to this revelation, the editor in chief of a leading radiology journal conceded, “We radiologists may be as guilty as others when it comes to not watching out for children.”24

The risk of developing cancer after a single CT scan may be as high as 1 in 150 for a baby girl.25 In general, the diagnostic medical radiation dealt out in one year is estimated to cause 2,800 breast cancers among American women, as well as 25,000 other cancers.26 In other words, doctors may be causing tens of thousands of cancers every year.

Patients undergoing these scans are rarely informed of these risks. For example, did you know that getting a chest CT scan is estimated to inflict the same cancer risk as smoking seven hundred cigarettes?27 One in every 270 middle-aged women may develop cancer due to a single angiogram.28 CT scans and x-rays can be lifesaving, but good evidence suggests that one-fifth to one-half of all CT scans aren’t necessary at all and could be replaced with a safer type of imaging or simply not performed at all.29

Many people expressed concern about the radiation exposure from the full-body scanners at airports using backscatter x-rays,30 but those machines have since been phased out. The airplane itself, however, is a different story. Because you’re exposed to more cosmic rays from outer space at higher altitudes, just one round-trip, cross-country flight may subject you to about the same level of radiation as a chest x-ray.31 (Given my past speaking schedule, I should be glowing in the dark by now!)

Is there anything you can do to mediate the radiation risk? As with so many other health questions, the answer is that you can eat healthfully.

In an investigation funded by the National Cancer Institute, researchers studied the diets and chromosome integrity of airline pilots, who get zapped with radiation daily, to see which foods might be protective. They found that pilots who consumed the most dietary antioxidants suffered the least amount of DNA damage to their bodies. Note the word dietary. Antioxidant supplements, such as vitamins C and E, didn’t seem to help. Pilots who consumed the most vitamin C through fruits and vegetables, though, appeared to be protected.32 Taking antioxidant supplements may be more than just a waste of money. People given 500 mg of vitamin C a day were found to end up with more oxidative DNA damage.33

Remember that natural antioxidants in food work synergistically; it’s the combination of many different compounds working together that tends to protect you, not high doses of single antioxidants found in supplements. Indeed, those pilots eating a mix of phytonutrients, concentrated in a variety of such plant foods as citrus, nuts, seeds, pumpkins, and peppers, had the lowest levels of DNA damage in response to the radiation they were bombarded with every day from the galaxy.34

The research team found that green, leafy vegetables like spinach and kale appear to have an edge over other vegetables and fruits when it comes to radiation protection.35 All this time I’ve been packing kale chips on flights just because they’re so lightweight, but it also turns out they may be protecting my DNA.

The same plant-based protection enjoyed by pilots was also found among atomic bomb survivors. For several decades, researchers have followed thirty-six thousand survivors of the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Those who ate vegetable- or fruit-rich diets appeared to cut their cancer risk by about 36 percent.36 We saw the same thing in the aftermath of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine, where consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables apparently protected children’s immune systems, while egg and fish consumption was associated with a significantly increased risk of DNA damage. The researchers suggest this result could have been due to the possibility that the animal foods they ate were contaminated with radioactive elements or the role of animal fats in free-radical formation.37

Nuclear events offer a rare opportunity to study these effects on humans since, obviously, it is unethical to intentionally expose people to radiation. However, as we’ve learned from declassified documents about U.S. Cold War radiation experiments, this didn’t stop our government from injecting “colored” people with plutonium38 or feeding “retarded” children radioactive isotopes in their breakfast cereal.39 Despite the Pentagon’s insistence that these methods were the “only feasible means” of developing ways to protect people from radiation,40 researchers have since come up with a few methods that don’t violate the Nuremburg Code.

One is to study human cells in a test tube. Research has found, for example, that white blood cells blasted with gamma rays suffered less DNA damage when the cells had been pretreated with phytonutrients from ginger root. The ginger compounds protected DNA nearly as well as the leading radiation sickness drug41 at 150 times lower the dose.42 Those taking ginger in order to prevent motion sickness during air travel may be protecting themselves against more than just nausea.

Other common foods that may be protective against radiation damage include garlic, turmeric, goji berries, and mint leaves,43 but none of these has been tested in clinical studies. How can we test the protective power of foods in people rather than petri dishes? To study how diet may protect against cosmic rays, airline pilots were studied. Guess who they studied to see if foods could be protective against x-rays? X-ray technicians.

Hospital workers who routinely operate x-ray machines have been found to suffer more chromosomal damage and to have higher levels of oxidative stress compared with other hospital workers.44 For this reason, researchers recruited a group of x-ray techs and asked them to drink two cups of lemon balm tea each day for a month. (Lemon balm is an herb in the mint family.) Even in that short time frame, the lemon balm tea appeared able to boost the level of antioxidant enzymes in the subjects’ bloodstreams while also reducing the amount of DNA damage they suffered.45

The Actual Benefit of Diet Versus Drugs

Based on a study of more than one hundred thousand Minnesotans, it appears that seven out of ten people may be prescribed at least one prescription drug in any given year. More than half are prescribed two or more drugs, and 20 percent are prescribed five or more medications.46 All told, physicians dispense about four billion prescriptions for drugs every year in the United States.47 That’s about thirteen prescriptions a year for every man, woman, and child.

The two prescription drugs most often brought up in doctor visits are simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering medication, and lisinopril, a blood-pressure pill.48 So a lot of drugs are being doled out in an attempt to prevent disease. But how well are these billions of pills working?

An overconfidence in the power of pills and procedures for disease prevention may be one of the reasons doctors and patients alike may undervalue diet and lifestyle interventions. When surveyed, people tend to wildly overestimate the ability of mammograms and colonoscopies to prevent cancer deaths, or the power of drugs like Fosamax to prevent hip fractures, or drugs like Lipitor to prevent fatal heart attacks.49 Patients believe cholesterol-lowering statin drugs are about twenty times more effective than they actually are in preventing heart attacks.50 No wonder most people continue to rely on drugs to save them! But the dirty little secret is that most people surveyed said they wouldn’t be willing to take many of these drugs if they knew how little benefit these products actually offered.51

How ineffectual are some of the most common drugs in America? When it comes to cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood-thinning drugs, the chance of even high-risk patients benefiting from them is typically less than 5 percent over a period of five years.52 When asked, most patients say they want to be told the truth.53 However, as doctors, we know that if we divulged this information, few of our patients would agree to take these drugs every day for the rest of their lives, which would be detrimental for the small percentage of people who do truly benefit from them. That’s why doctors in the know and drug companies oversell the benefits by conveniently not mentioning how tiny these benefits actually are. When it comes to chronic disease management, practicing conventional medicine can be thought of as practicing deceptive medicine.

For the hundreds of millions of people on these drugs who don’t benefit, it’s not simply a matter of all the money spent and all the side effects endured. To me, the true tragedy is all the lost opportunities to address the root causes of patients’ conditions. When people dramatically overestimate how much their prescription pills protect them, they may be less likely to make the dietary changes necessary to dramatically lower their risk.

Take cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, for example. The best they may be able to offer in terms of absolute risk reduction for a subsequent heart attack or death is about 3 percent over six years.54 Meanwhile, a whole-food, plant-based diet may work twenty times better, potentially offering an absolute risk reduction of 60 percent after fewer than four years.55 In 2014, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. published a case series of about two hundred people with significant heart disease showing that a healthy enough plant-based diet may prevent further major cardiac episodes in 99.4 percent of patients who follow it.56

You don’t really have the luxury of choosing between following a healthy diet or taking a pill to prevent a heart attack because pills may not work in the near term in 97 percent of the cases. Of course, diet and drugs are not mutually exclusive, and many under Dr. Esselstyn’s care wisely continued to take their cardiac meds. You just need to have a realistic understanding of how limited a role the contents of your medicine cabinets play compared to the contents of your refrigerator. Heart disease may continue to be the number-one killer of men, women, and eventually our children if doctors continue to rely on drugs and stents. However, if you eat a healthy enough diet, you may be able to reverse the stranglehold it has on your heart. That is something doctors can be proud to divulge to our patients.

Aspirin

How well do over-the-counter drugs perform? For example, take aspirin. Perhaps the most commonly used medication in the world,57 it’s been around in pill form for over a century. Its active ingredient, salicylic acid, has been used in its natural form (as an extract of willow tree bark) to ease pain and fever for thousands of years.58 One of the reasons it remains so popular—despite the fact that better anti-inflammatory painkillers exist now—is that it’s used by millions of people on a daily basis as a blood thinner to reduce the risk of a heart attack. As we saw in chapter 1, heart attacks often occur when a blood clot forms in response to a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque in one of your coronary arteries. Taking aspirin may help stop this from happening.

Aspirin may also lower the risk of cancer.59 It works by suppressing an enzyme within your body that creates pro-clotting factors, thereby thinning your blood. At the same time, aspirin suppresses proinflammatory compounds called prostaglandins, which in turn reduces pain, swelling, and fever. Prostaglandins may also dilate the lymph vessels inside tumors, potentially allowing cancer cells to spread. One of the ways scientists think aspirin helps prevent cancer deaths is by counteracting a tumor’s attempts to pry open the lymphatic bars on its cage and spread throughout the body.60

So should everyone take a “baby”-strength aspirin a day? (Note that aspirin should never actually be given to infants or children.)61 No. The problem is that aspirin can cause side effects. The same blood-thinning benefit that can prevent a heart attack can also cause a hemorrhagic stroke, in which you bleed into your brain. Aspirin can also damage the lining of the digestive tract. For those who’ve already had a heart attack and continue to eat the same diet that led to the first one (and are therefore at exceedingly high risk of having another one), the risk-benefit analysis seems clear: Taking aspirin would probably prevent about six times more serious problems than it causes you. But among the general population who have yet to have their first heart attack, the risks and benefits are more closely matched.62 Thus, taking an aspirin a day is generally not recommended.63 Throw in even a 10 percent reduction in cancer mortality, though, and it could tip the risk-benefit balance in favor of aspirin.64 Given that regular, low-dose aspirin use may reduce the risk of cancer mortality by one-third,65 it is tempting to recommend it for nearly everyone. If only you could get the benefits without the risks.

Well, maybe you can.

The willow tree isn’t the only plant that contains salicylic acid. It’s widely found in many of the fruits and vegetables in the plant kingdom.66 That’s why you often find the active ingredient of aspirin in the bloodstreams of people who aren’t taking it.67 The more fruits and vegetables you eat, the higher your level of salicylic acid may rise.68 In fact, the levels of people eating plant-based diets actually overlap with those of some people taking low-dose aspirin.69

With all that salicylic acid flowing through their systems, you might think plant eaters would have higher ulcer rates, because aspirin is known to chew away at the gut. But those following plant-based diets actually appear to have a significantly lower risk of ulcers.70 How is that possible? Because in plants, the salicylic acid may come naturally prepackaged with gut-protective nutrients. For example, nitric oxide from dietary nitrates exerts stomach-protective effects by boosting blood flow and protective mucus production in the lining of the stomach, effects which demonstrably oppose the pro-ulcerative impact of aspirin.71 So, for the general population, by eating plants instead of taking aspirin, individuals may not only get aspirin’s benefits without its risks but also get the benefits—with benefits.

People who have had a heart attack should follow their physician’s advice, which probably includes taking aspirin every day. But what about everyone else? I think everyone should take aspirin—but in the form of produce, not a pill.

The salicylic acid content in plants may help explain why traditional, plant-based diets were so protective. For instance, before their diets were Westernized, animal products made up only about 5 percent of the average Japanese diet.72 During this period in the 1950s, age-adjusted death rates from colon, prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers were five to ten times lower in Japan than in the United States, while incidences of pancreatic cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma were three to four times lower. This phenomenon was not unique to the Japanese. As we’ve seen throughout this book, Western rates of cancers and heart disease have been found to be dramatically lower among populations whose diets are centered around plant foods.73

If part of this protection arises from the aspirin phytonutrients, which plants in particular are packed with the stuff? While salicylic acid is ubiquitously present in fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices contain the highest concentrations.74 Chili powder, paprika, and turmeric are rich in the compound, but cumin has the most per serving. Indeed, just one teaspoon of ground cumin may be about the equivalent of a baby aspirin. This may help explain why India, with its spice-rich diets, has among the lowest worldwide rates of colorectal cancer75—the cancer that appears most sensitive to the effects of aspirin.76

And the spicier, the better! A spicy vegetable vindaloo has been calculated to contain four times the salicylic acid content of a milder madras-style veggie dish. Eat a single meal, and you can get the same spike in salicylic acid in your bloodstream as if you took an aspirin.77

The benefits of salicylic acid are another reason you should strive to choose organic produce. Because the plant uses the compound as a defense hormone, its concentration may be increased when that plant is bitten by bugs. Pesticide-laden plants aren’t nibbled as much and, perhaps as a result, appear to produce less salicylic acid. For example, in one study, soup made from organic vegetables was found to contain nearly six times more salicylic acid than soup prepared from conventional, nonorganically grown ingredients.78

Another way to get more salicylic acid bang for your buck is by opting for whole foods. Whole-grain breads, for example, not only offer more salicylic acid but may contain one hundred times more phytochemicals in general than white bread—reportedly eight hundred compared with approximately eight.79

Attention has been focused on salicylic acid because of the voluminous data on aspirin, but hundreds of the other phytonutrients have been found to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity as well. Still, given the strength of the aspirin evidence, there are those in the public health community who talk of a widespread “salicylic acid deficiency,” proposing that the compound be classed as an essential vitamin: “Vitamin S.”80 Whether it’s the salicylic acid or a combination of other phytonutrients that account for the benefits of whole plant foods, the solution is the same: Eat more of them.

Colonoscopies

The colonoscopy. You’ll be hard pressed to find a more dreaded routine procedure. Every year, U.S. doctors may perform more than fourteen million colonoscopies,81 an exam used to detect abnormal changes in the large intestine (colon) and rectum. During the procedure, doctors insert a five-foot-long flexible tube fitted with a tiny video camera and inflate the colon with air to visualize the colon lining. Any suspicious polyps or other abnormal tissue can be biopsied during the procedure. Colonoscopies can help doctors diagnose causes of rectal bleeding or chronic diarrhea, but routine colon cancer screenings may be the most common reason they are performed.

The reasons doctors often find it difficult to convince their patients to keep coming back for colonoscopies include the necessary bowel prep, during which you have to drink quarts of a powerful liquid laxative before the procedure to completely clean yourself out. There’s also the pain and discomfort of the procedure itself82 (though you’re purposefully given drugs with amnesiac effects so you won’t remember how it felt),83 feelings of embarrassment and vulnerability, and the fear of complications.84 These fears are not unfounded. Despite how routinely colonoscopies are performed, serious complications occur in about 1 out of every 350 cases, including such issues as perforations and fatal bleeding.85 Perforations can occur when the tip of the colonoscope punctures the wall of the colon, when the colon is overinflated, or when a doctor cauterizes a bleeding biopsy site. In extremely rare cases, this cautery can ignite some residual gas and cause the colon to literally explode.86

Death from colonoscopy is rare, occurring in only about 1 in every 2,500 procedures.87 Yet this means colonoscopies may be killing thousands of Americans every year, raising the question: Do the benefits outweigh the risks?

Colonoscopies are not the only screening technique for colon cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the official prevention guidelines body, considers colonoscopies just one of three acceptable colon-cancer screening strategies. Starting at age fifty, everyone should get either a colonoscopy once a decade, have their stool tested for hidden blood every year (which involves no scoping at all), or have a sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing every three. The evidence supporting “virtual” colonoscopies or DNA stool testing was judged insufficient.88 Though routine screenings are no longer recommended at age seventy-five, this assumes you’ve been testing negative for twenty-five years. If you’re now seventy-five and have never been screened, then it’s probably a good idea to get screened at least into your eighties.89

Sigmoidoscopy uses a much smaller scope than in a colonoscopy and has ten times fewer complications.90 However, because the scope may only go about two feet inside your body, it might miss tumors farther inside. So which is better overall? We won’t know until randomized controlled colonoscopy trials are published in the mid-2020s.91 Most other developed countries do not recommend either scoping procedure, though. For routine colon cancer screening, they still endorse the noninvasive stool blood testing.92

Which of the three options is best for you? The USPSTF recommends that the decision should be made on an individualized basis after weighing the benefits and risks with your doctor.

To what extent, though, do doctors inform patients of their options? Researchers audiotaped clinic visits to find out. They were looking for the nine essential elements of informed decision making, which include explaining the pros and cons of each option, describing the alternatives, and making sure the patient understands these options.93

Unfortunately, when it came to colon cancer screening, in most cases, the doctors and nurse practitioners studied communicated none of this vital information, zero out of nine elements.94 As an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association put it: “There are too many probabilities and uncertainties for patients to consider and too little time for clinicians to discuss them with patients.”95 So doctors tend to just make up patients’ minds for them. What do they choose? A National Cancer Institute–funded survey of more than one thousand physicians found that nearly all doctors (94.8 percent) recommended a colonoscopy.96 Why do doctors push colonoscopies in the United States when most of the rest of the world appears to prefer noninvasive alternatives?97 It may be because most doctors in the rest of the world don’t get paid by procedure.98 As one U.S. gastroenterologist put it, “Colonoscopy … is the goose that has laid the golden egg.”99

An exposé in the New York Times on spiraling health care costs noted that in many other developed countries, colonoscopies cost just a few hundred dollars. In the United States? The procedure may cost thousands, which the journalists concluded has less to do with providing top-notch medical care and more with business plans aimed at maximizing revenue, marketing, and lobbying.100 Who’s in charge of setting the prices? The American Medical Association. A Washington Post investigation exposed that each year, a secretive AMA committee determines billing standards for common procedures. The result is gross overestimates for the time it takes to perform common services like colonoscopies. As the Post pointed out, if AMA standards are to be believed, some doctors would have to work more than twenty-four hours a day to perform all the procedures they report to Medicare and private insurers. Is it any wonder that gastroenterologists bank nearly $500,000 per year?101

But why would your family doctor or internist push the procedure if they’re not the ones doing it? Many doctors who refer their patients to gastroenterologists receive what are essentially financial kickbacks. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on this practice of so-called self-referrals, a scheme where providers refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest. The GAO estimated that doctors make nearly a million more referrals every year than they would have if they were not personally profiting.102

What to Take Before a Colonoscopy

Ever popped one of those breath mints after a big meal at a restaurant? Peppermint doesn’t just make your breath smell better; it also helps to reduce the gastrocolic reflex—the urge to defecate following a meal. Nerves in your stomach stretch after eating, which triggers spasms in the colon to enable your body to make room for more food coming down the pike. Peppermint can reduce these spasms by relaxing the muscles that line your colon.103

What does this have to do with colonoscopies? If you take circular strips of human colons removed during surgery and lay them on a table, they spontaneously contract about three times per minute. Isn’t that kind of creepy? But if you drip menthol (found in peppermint) onto the colon strips, the strength of the contractions diminishes significantly.104 During a colonoscopy, such spasms can hinder the progress of the scope and cause the patient discomfort. By relaxing colon muscles, peppermint can make the procedure easier for both doctor and patient.

Doctors have experimented with spraying peppermint oil from the tip of the colonoscope,105 as well as using a hand pump to flood the colon with a peppermint solution prior to the procedure.106 The simplest solution might be the best, though: asking the patient to swallow peppermint oil capsules. Premedicating with eight drops’ worth of peppermint essential oil four hours before a colonoscopy was found to significantly reduce colon spasms, patient pain, and make the scope easier to insert and withdraw compared with a placebo.107

If you do need a colonoscopy, ask your doctor about using this simple plant remedy. It might make it easier on both of you.

Clearly, patients in America may be getting more medical care than they really need. So said Dr. Barbara Starfield, who literally wrote the book on primary care.108 One of our nation’s most prestigious physicians, she composed the scathing commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association naming medical care as the third-leading cause of death in the United States.109

Her primary-care work has been widely embraced, but her findings on the potentially ineffective and even harmful nature of U.S. health care received almost no attention. “The American public appears to have been hoodwinked into believing that more interventions lead to better health,” she later said in an interview.110 As one health care quality advisor noted, the widespread disregard of Dr. Starfield’s evidence “recalls the dark dystopia of George Orwell’s 1984, where awkward facts swallowed up by the ‘memory hole’ become as if they had never existed at all.”111

Sadly, Dr. Starfield is no longer with us. Ironically, she may have died from one of the adverse drug reactions she so vociferously warned us about. After she was placed on two blood thinners to prevent a stent in her heart from clogging up, she told her cardiologist she was bruising more and bleeding longer—that’s the drug risk you hope doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Then Dr. Starfield died after apparently hitting her head while swimming and bleeding into her brain.112

The question I ask myself is not whether she should have been put on two blood thinners for as long as she was—or whether she should have had the stent inserted to begin with. Rather, I wonder if she could have avoided the medication and the surgery both by avoiding the heart disease in the first place. Heart attacks are considered 96 percent avoidable in women who eat a wholesome diet and engage in other healthy lifestyle behaviors.113 The number-one killer of women need almost never happen.


//
The healthiest diet is one that maximizes the intake of whole plant foods and minimizes the intake of animal-based foods and processed junk. Simply put, eat more green-light foods. Eat fewer yellow-light foods. And, especially, eat even fewer red-light foods. Just like running red lights in the real world, you may be able to get away with it once in a while, but I wouldn’t recommend making a habit out of it.

Given this, what we’ve seen in the previous chapters makes a lot of sense. Unprocessed plant foods tend to have more of the protective nutrients that Americans are lacking and fewer disease-promoting factors. No wonder the eating habit apparently best able to control our epidemics of dietary disease is a whole-food, plant-based diet. After all, food is a package deal.

This is one of the most important concepts in all of nutrition. Yes, there is calcium in cheese, protein in pork, and iron in beef, but what about all the baggage that comes along with these nutrients—the dose of dairy hormones, the lard, the saturated fat? As much as Burger King proclaims you can “Have It Your Way,” you can’t go up to the counter and ask for a burger, hold the saturated fat and cholesterol. Food is, indeed, a package deal.

Dairy is the number-one source of calcium in the United States, but it’s also the number-one source of saturated fat. What kind of “baggage” do you get along with the calcium in green, leafy vegetables? Fiber, folate, iron, and antioxidants—some of the very nutrients lacking in milk. By getting most of your nutrition from whole plant foods, you get a bonus instead of baggage.

When the National Pork Board promotes ham as an “excellent source of protein,”12 I can’t help but think of the famous quote from a McDonald’s senior vice president for marketing who, under oath in a court of law, described Coca-Cola as nutritious because it is “providing water.”


//*************************************************************
Why Don’t the Dietary Guidelines Just Say No?

Part of the USDA’s mission is “expanding markets for agricultural products.”14 At the same time, the federal agency is tasked with protecting public health by helping to develop the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. That’s why, when those two directives are in sync, their eat-more language is clear: “Increase fruit intake.” “Increase vegetable intake.”15 But when their dual mandates are in conflict—when “improving nutrition and health” is at odds with promoting “agriculture production”16—the eat-less messaging of the Dietary Guidelines gets repackaged and ends up referring to biochemical components: “Reduce intake of solid fats (major sources of saturated and trans fatty acids).”

What’s the average consumer supposed to do with that obscure little nugget?

When the Guidelines tell you to eat less added sugar, calories, cholesterol, saturated fat, sodium, and trans fat, that’s code for eat less junk food, less meat, less dairy, fewer eggs, and fewer processed foods. But they can’t actually say that. When they did in the past, all heck broke loose. For example, when a USDA employee newsletter even suggested trying a meat-free lunch once a week as part of Johns Hopkins University’s School of Public Health “Meatless Mondays” initiative,17 the resulting political firestorm from the meat industry led the USDA to retract the advice just hours later.18 “As a result of these conflicts [of interest],” concluded an analysis in the Food and Drug Law Journal, “the Guidelines sometimes favor the interests of the food and drug industries over the public’s interest in accurate and impartial dietary advice.”19

This reminds me of the landmark report on trans fat from the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine, one of our most prestigious institutions.20 They concluded that no amount of trans fat is safe “because any incremental increase in trans fatty acid intake increases C[oronary] H[eart] D[isease] risk.”21 Since trans fats are found naturally in meat and dairy products,22 this placed them in a quandary: “Because trans fats are unavoidable in ordinary, nonvegan diets, consuming 0 percent of energy would require significant changes in patterns of dietary intake.”23

So if trans fats are found in meat and dairy and the only safe intake of trans fats is zero, that means the Institute of Medicine went on to encourage everyone to start eating a plant-based diet, right? No, they did not. The director of Harvard’s Cardiovascular Epidemiology Program famously explained why: “We can’t tell people to stop eating all meat and all dairy products,” he said. “Well, we could tell people to become vegetarians,” he added. “If we were truly basing this only on science, we would, but it is a bit extreme.”24

We certainly wouldn’t want scientists to base anything on science!

//******************************************88
How SAD Is the Standard American Diet?

As cynical as I’ve become about diet and nutrition in this country, I was still surprised by a 2010 report from the National Cancer Institute on the status of the American diet. For example, three out of four Americans don’t eat a single piece of fruit in a given day, and nearly nine out of ten don’t reach the minimum recommended daily intake of vegetables. On a weekly basis, 96 percent of Americans don’t reach the minimum for greens or beans (three servings a week for adults), 98 percent don’t reach the minimum for orange vegetables (two servings a week), and 99 percent don’t reach the minimum for whole grains (about three to four ounces a day).25

Then there was the junk food. The federal guidelines were so lax that up to 25 percent of your diet could be made up of “discretionary calories,” meaning junk. A quarter of your calories could come from cotton candy washed down with Mountain Dew, and you’d still be within the guidelines. Yet we failed. Astoundingly, 95 percent of Americans exceeded their discretionary calorie allowance. Only one in a thousand American children between the ages of two and eight made the cutoff, consuming less than the equivalent of about a dozen spoonfuls of sugar a day.26

And we wonder why there is an obesity epidemic?

“In conclusion,” the researchers wrote, “nearly the entire U.S. population consumes a diet that is not on par with recommendations. These findings add another piece to the rather disturbing picture that is emerging of a nation’s diet in crisis.”27

Producers of unhealthy commodities aren’t out to make you sick. They’re just trying to make a buck. Coca-Cola’s profit margin, for example, is about one quarter of the soda’s retail price, making soft-drink production, alongside tobacco, among the most profitable industries.28 What’s harder to understand is why the public health community isn’t doing more about it.

“When the history of the world’s attempt to address obesity is written,” wrote the head of Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity, “the greatest failure may be collaboration with and appeasement of the food industry.”29 For instance, Susan G. Komen, a leading U.S. breast cancer charity, linked up with fast-food giant KFC to sell pink buckets of fried chicken.30

Save the Children used to be a leader in the push for taxes on soda to offset some of the costs of childhood obesity. Then the organization did an abrupt 180-degree turn, withdrawing its support, saying that such campaigns no longer “fit with the way that Save the Children works.” Perhaps it is only a coincidence that it was seeking a grant from Coca-Cola and had already accepted a $5 million grant from Pepsi.31

Even though our eating habits are now killing more Americans than our smoking habits,32 I often hear the refrain in public health circles that we have to work with, rather than against, these companies, because unlike with tobacco, we don’t have to smoke, but we do have to eat.33 Well, yes, we need to breathe—but we don’t need to breathe smoke. And yes, we need to eat, but we don’t need to eat junk.


//*************************************************
How I Define “Processed”

My Traffic Light model stresses two important general concepts: Plant foods, with their greater protective nutritional factors and fewer disease-promoting ones, are healthier than animal foods, and unprocessed foods are healthier than processed foods. Is that always true? No. Am I saying that all plant foods are better than all animal foods? No. In fact, one of the worst items on store shelves is partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening—a product that has vegetable right in its name! Even some unprocessed plants—such as blue-green algae—can be toxic.34 Anyone who’s had a bad case of poison ivy knows plants don’t always like to be messed with. In general, though, choose plant foods over animal foods, and unprocessed over processed. Michael Pollan, bestselling author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma, has said, “If it came from a plant, eat it. If it was made in a plant, don’t.”35

What do I mean by processed? The classic example is the milling of grains from whole wheat to white flour. Isn’t it ironic that these are called “refined” grains, a word meaning improved or made more elegant? The elegance was not felt by the millions who died in the nineteenth century from beriberi, a vitamin B–deficiency disease that resulted from polishing rice from brown to white.36 (White rice is now fortified with vitamins to compensate for the “refinement.”) A Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of the cause of beriberi and its cure—rice bran, the brown part of rice that was removed. Beriberi can cause damage to the heart muscle, resulting in death from heart failure. Surely such a thing could never happen in modern times—an epidemic of heart disease that could be prevented and cured with a change in diet? Come on. (Please reread chapter 1.)

Sometimes, however, processing can make foods healthier. For example, tomato juice appears to be the one common juice that may actually be healthier than the whole fruit. The processing of tomato products boosts the availability of the antioxidant red pigment lycopene by as much as fivefold.37 Similarly, the removal of fat from cacao beans to make cocoa powder improves the nutritional profile, because cocoa butter is one of the rare saturated plant fats (along with coconut and palm kernel oils) that can raise your cholesterol.38

So for the purposes of the Traffic Light model, I like to think of “unprocessed” as nothing bad added, nothing good taken away. In the above example, tomato juice could be thought of as relatively unprocessed because even much of the fiber is retained—unless salt is added, which would make it a processed food in my book and bump it right out of the green zone. Similarly, I would consider chocolate—but not cocoa powder—processed because sugar is added.

Using my definition of nothing bad added, nothing good taken away, steel-cut oats, rolled oats, and even (plain) instant oatmeal can all be considered unprocessed. Almonds are obviously a whole plant food. I would also consider no-salt-added almond butter to be a green-light food, but even unsweetened almond milk is a processed food, a food from which nutrition has been stolen. Am I saying almond milk is bad for you? Foods are not so much good or bad as they are better or worse. All I’m saying is that unprocessed foods tend to be healthier than processed ones. Think of it this way: Eating almonds is healthier than drinking almond milk.

The limited role I see for yellow-light foods in a healthy diet is to promote the consumption of green-light foods. For instance, if the only way I can get patients to eat oatmeal in the morning is if they make it creamy with almond milk, then I tell them to go right ahead. The same could be said for red-light foods. Without hot sauce, my intake of dark-green, leafy vegetables would plummet. Yes, I know there are all sorts of sodium-free, exotically flavored vinegars out there that I could use, and maybe one day I’ll wean myself off Tabasco. But given my current tastes, the green ends justify the red means. If the only way you’re going to eat a big salad is to sprinkle Bac-Os on top, then sprinkle away.

Bac-Os are what are referred to as ultraprocessed foods, bearing no redeeming nutritional qualities or resemblance to anything that grew out of the ground and often containing added garbage. Bac-Os, for example, have added trans fats, salt, sugar, and Red 40, a food dye banned in a number of European countries.39 As a red-light food, it ideally should be avoided, but if the alternative to your big spinach salad with Bac-Os is KFC, then it’s better to have the salad with the Bac-Os. They can be the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down. The same goes for real bacon bits, for that matter.

I realize some people have religious or ethical objections to even trivial amounts of animal products. (Growing up Jewish near the largest pig factory west of the Mississippi, I can relate to both sentiments.) But from a human health standpoint, when it comes to animal products and processed foods, it’s the overall diet that matters.

//**********************************************************************************
************************************************************************************
What Does “Whole-Food, Plant-Based” Mean, Exactly?

Sometimes people’s diets take on a religiosity of their own. I remember a man once telling me that he could never “go plant based” because he could never give up his grandma’s chicken soup. Huh? Then don’t! After I asked him to say hello to his bubby for me, I told him that enjoying her soup shouldn’t keep him from making healthier choices the rest of the time. The problem with all-or-nothing thinking is that it keeps people from even taking the first steps. The thought of never having pepperoni pizza again somehow turns into an excuse to keep ordering it every week. Why not scale down to once a month or reserve it for special occasions? We cannot let the “perfect” be the enemy of the good.

It’s really the day-to-day stuff that matters most. What you eat on special occasions is insignificant compared to what you eat day in and day out. So don’t beat yourself up if you really want to put edible bacon-flavored candles on your birthday cake. (I’m not making those up!40) Your body has a remarkable ability to recover from sporadic insults as long as you’re not habitually poking it with a fork.

This book is not about vegetarianism, veganism, or any other “-ism.” There are people who completely eliminate any and all animal products as part of a religious or moral stance and may indeed end up better off as a side benefit.41 But strictly from a human health standpoint, you would be hard pressed to argue, for example, that the traditional Okinawan diet, which is 96 percent plant based,42 is inferior to a typical Western, 100 percent vegan diet. In Kaiser Permanente’s guide “The Plant-Based Diet: A Healthier Way to Eat,” the authors define a plant-based diet as one that excludes animal products completely, but they make sure to note: “If you find you cannot do a plant-based diet 100 percent of the time, then aim for 80 percent. Any movement toward more plants and fewer animal products can improve your health!”43

From a nutrition standpoint, the reason I don’t like the terms vegetarian and vegan is that they are only defined by what you don’t eat. When I used to speak on college campuses, I would meet vegans who appeared to be living off french fries and beer. Vegan, technically, but not exactly health promoting. That’s why I prefer the term whole-food, plant-based nutrition. As far as I can discern, the best available balance of evidence suggests that the healthiest diet is one centered on unprocessed plant foods. On a day-to-day basis, the more whole plant foods and the fewer processed and animal products, the better.

//*****************
Preparing Yourself for Healthier Habits

First, you need to know your own psychology. There are certain personality types that do better when they go all in. If you tend to have an “addictive” personality, or if you are the kind of person who takes things to extremes—for instance, you either don’t drink at all or you drink in excess—it’s probably best for you to try to stick with the program. But some individuals can get away with “social smoking,” for example; they can light up a few times a year and escape nicotine dependence.45 The reason we as physicians advocate for smokers to quit completely is not because we think that one cigarette every once in a while is going to do irreversible damage but because we’re afraid that one cigarette may lead to two, and, before long, the unhealthy habit has taken hold. Similarly, one (well-cooked) hamburger is not going to kill anyone. It’s what you eat day to day that adds up. You have to take stock of your disposition to know if you can overcome the risk of sliding down the slippery slope.

There’s a concept in psychology called “decision fatigue” that marketers use to exploit consumers. It appears humans have a limited capacity to make many decisions in one short stretch of time, and the quality of our decisions will deteriorate to the extent that we eventually begin making downright irrational choices. Ever wonder why supermarkets stack the junk food at the checkout counter? After wading through the forty thousand items in the average supermarket,46 we end up with less willpower to resist impulse purchases.47 So making rules for yourself and sticking to them may help you make more sensible choices over the long run. For instance, making a strict decision to never cook with oil, to avoid meat entirely, or to eat only whole grains may paradoxically make for sturdier life changes. By not having junk food in the house, you remove the temptation by removing the choice. I know if I get hungry enough I’ll eat an apple.

There may also be a physiological argument for not wildly deviating from a well-planned diet. After a vacation cruise during which you indulged in all manner of rich foods, your palate may get dulled to the point where the natural foods you enjoyed just the week before no longer deliver the same taste satisfaction. For some, this may simply require a period of readjustment. But for others, this departure from an otherwise healthy diet may lead back to a dietary glut involving added salt, sugar, and fat.

For those of us who grew up eating SAD (the Standard American Diet), starting to eat healthfully can be a big shift. I know it was for me. Though my mom tried to keep us eating good-for-us foods at home, when I was hanging out with friends, we’d go through boxes of Little Debbie snack cakes and indulge in greasy meals at the local Chinese restaurant, where I’d order spareribs or any other dish with chunks of deep-fried meat. One of my favorite snacks was nacho cheese–flavored Slim Jims.

Thankfully, I was able to escape SAD’s clutches before any overt health problems arose. That was twenty-five years ago. Looking back, I view that as one of the best decisions of my life.

Some go cold turkey, if you will, while others transition more slowly using a variety of approaches. One I’ve used personally in my medical practice is Kaiser Permanente’s three-step method. Realizing that most American families tend to rotate through the same eight or nine meals, step one suggests that you think of three meals you already enjoy that are plant based, like pasta and marinara sauce that could be easily tweaked to whole-grain pasta with some added veggies. Step two asks you to think of three meals you already eat that could be adapted to become a green-light meal, like switching from beef chili to five-bean chili. Step three is my favorite: Discover new healthy options.48

Ironically, many people following healthy diets report eating an even greater variety of foods than when they ate their former “unrestricted” diet. Before widespread use of the Internet, I used to tell people to go to their public libraries and borrow cookbooks. Today, Google whole-food, plant-based recipes, and a million hits pop up. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, good places to start include:

• ForksOverKnives.com: This site of the wildly popular documentary and book of the same name offers hundreds of recipes.

• StraightUpFood.com: Cooking instructor Cathy Fisher shares more than one hundred recipes on this site.

• HappyHealthyLongLife.com: This site’s tagline reads: “A [Cleveland Clinic] medical librarian’s adventures in evidence-based living.” She used the e word—I think I’m in love!

Once you’ve found three new meals you enjoy and can prepare with ease, step three is complete. You now have a nine-meal rotation, and you’re off! After that, moving on to breakfast and lunch is easy.

If you hate to cook and just want the cheapest, easiest way to make healthy meals, I highly recommend dietitian Jeff Novick’s Fast Food DVD series. Using common staples like canned beans, frozen vegetables, quick-cook whole grains, and spice mixes, Jeff shows you how you can feed your family healthfully in no time for about four dollars a day per person. The DVDs also include grocery store walk-throughs, shopping tips, and information on how to decipher nutrition labels. Check out his cooking series at JeffNovick.com/RD/DVDs.

If you crave more structure and social support, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), a nonprofit nutrition research and policy advocacy organization in Washington, D.C., has a fantastic three-week kick-start program for plant-based eating. Check it out at 21DayKickstart.org. This free online nutrition program starts the first of every month and offers a full meal plan, recipes, tips, resources, a restaurant guide, and a community forum. As of this writing, it’s offered in four languages. Hundreds of thousands of people have already benefited from it, so feel free to give it a try.

I’ve always tried to get my patients to think of healthy eating as an experiment. It can be overwhelming to think of such a sweeping change as permanent. That’s why I ask them to give me just three weeks. I find that if my patients think of it simply as an experiment, they’re more likely to go whole hog (whole grain?) and realize the maximum benefits. But that’s just me being sneaky. I know that once those three weeks are up, if they really gave it their all, they will be feeling so much better, their lab values will be looking so much better, and their palates will have started to change. Healthy eating tastes better and better the longer you stick with it.

I remember talking about this with Dr. Neal Barnard, founding president of PCRM, which publishes a great deal of research pitting a healthy diet against a variety of common ailments—everything from acne and arthritis to menstrual cramps and migraines. He often uses what’s called an “A-B-A” study design. Participants’ health is assessed at baseline on their regular diets, and then they’re switched to a therapeutic diet. In an effort to make sure any health changes participants experience on the new diet aren’t merely a coincidence, they are then switched back to their regular diet to see if the changes disappear.

This kind of rigorous study design improves the validity of the results, but the problem, Dr. Barnard related, is that sometimes people improve too much. After a few weeks on a plant-based diet, sometimes people feel so much better that they refuse to go back on their baseline diet49—even though it’s required by the study protocol. Since they didn’t complete the study as planned, their data have to be effectively thrown out and may never make it into the final paper. Ironically, healthy eating can be so effective that it undermines its own studies of effectiveness!

WWDGE: What Would Dr. Greger Eat?

I’m regularly asked what I eat every day. I’ve always been hesitant to answer for a number of reasons. First, it shouldn’t matter what I or anyone else eats, says, or does. The science is the science. Too much of the nutrition world is split into camps, each following their respective guru. What other field of serious scientific inquiry is like that? After all, 2 + 2 = 4 regardless of what your favorite mathematician thinks. This is because there isn’t a trillion-dollar industry that profits from confusing people about arithmetic. If you were getting conflicting messages from all sides about basic math, in desperation, you might have to choose one authority to stick with, hoping that person will accurately represent the available research. Who has time to read and decipher all the original source material?

Early on in my practice, I decided that I didn’t want to rely on anyone else’s interpretation for what could ultimately be life-or-death decisions for my patients. I had the access, the resources, and the background to interpret the science on my own. When I initially began my annual reviews of the nutrition literature, it was really just to make myself a better doctor. But when I discovered such a treasure trove of information, I knew I couldn’t keep it to myself. My hope is to disseminate it in a way that removes me as much as possible from the equation. I don’t want to present the trademarked Dr. Greger Diet; I want to present the best-available-evidence diet. That’s why I show the original papers, charts, graphs, and quotes with links to all the primary sources in my NutritionFacts.org videos. I try to keep my own interpretation to a minimum—though admittedly, I sometimes can’t help myself!

What a person chooses to do with information is highly personalized and often depends on such factors as his or her current life situation and how risk averse he or she is. Given the same information, two people can make two entirely different but legitimate decisions. For this reason, I’ve been hesitant to share my own personal choices, because I’m afraid they’ll unduly sway people to make decisions that might not be right for them. I’d rather just present the science and let others decide for themselves.

In addition, everyone’s taste buds are different. I can imagine someone thinking, He puts hot sauce on what? When people hear me talk about the wonders of hummus (a Middle Eastern chickpea spread) but not baba ganoush (a Middle Eastern roasted-eggplant spread), they might come away with the impression that I think one is healthier than the other. This may be (and probably is, actually), but my real reason is simple: I don’t like the taste of eggplant.

Conversely, just because I eat something doesn’t mean it’s healthy. For example, people are surprised to hear I use dutched (alkali-processed) cocoa. In that process, more than half of the antioxidants and flavanol phytonutrients are wiped out.50 Why would I use it, then? Because it tastes so much better to me than unprocessed cocoa. While I encourage people to use natural cocoa, I don’t take my own advice in that regard. In some cases, it would be better if people would do as I say, not as I do.

And what if I shared a recipe that someone found utterly repulsive? I would hate for him or her to think, If this is healthy eating, count me out! As you eat healthier, your palate actually changes. It’s an amazing phenomenon. Your taste buds are constantly adapting—minute to minute, in fact. If you drank some orange juice right now, it would taste sweet. But if you first ate some candy and then drank the same OJ, it could taste unpleasantly bitter. Over the long term, the more you eat healthfully, the better healthy foods taste.

I remember the first time I sipped a green smoothie. I was speaking somewhere in Michigan, hosted by a darling physician couple. They told me that they drank “blended salads” for breakfast. Intellectually, I loved the idea. Greens, the healthiest food on the planet, in convenient liquid form? I envisioned myself drinking a salad on my way to work every day. But then I tasted it. It felt like I was drinking someone’s lawn. I gagged and almost threw up over my hosts’ kitchen table.

Green smoothies are something you have to build up to. Everyone loves fruit smoothies. A frozen banana, strawberries—yum! And surprisingly, you can throw a handful of baby spinach in there and you may hardly even taste it. Give it a try! You’ll be surprised. Okay, so if one handful is good, how about two? Slowly, your taste buds can adapt to increasing quantities of greens. This happens with all your senses. Walk into a dark room, and your eyes will slowly adapt. Stick your foot into a hot bath, and though at first it may be too hot, your body equilibrates to a new normal. Likewise, in just a couple of weeks, you can be drinking—and enjoying—concoctions you’d now consider absolutely wretched.

Having said all that, I will now proceed to tell you what I eat, what I drink, what I do, and how I do it. In each subsequent chapter, I will dive deeper into each of the entries on my Daily Dozen checklist to describe which types of these green-light foods are my favorites, as well as the tricks and techniques I use to prepare them. I will not be detailing every type of bean, fruit, vegetable, nut, or spice that I eat. Rather, my goal here is to explore some of the interesting science behind a few of my favorite options in each category.

Please understand that my strategy is a way to do it rather than the way to do it. If it happens to work for you too, great. If not, I hope you’ll explore the myriad other ways you could use this same body of evidence to help improve and prolong your life.


//***************************************************************
*****************************************************************
Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen

Whole-food, plant-based nutrition—pretty self-explanatory, right? But aren’t some green-light foods better than others? For example, you can apparently live extended periods eating practically nothing but potatoes.1 That would, by definition, be a whole-food, plant-based diet—but not a very healthy one. All plant foods are not created equal.

The more I’ve researched over the years, the more I’ve come to realize that healthy foods are not necessary interchangeable. Some foods and food groups have special nutrients not found in abundance elsewhere. For example, sulforaphane, the amazing liver-enzyme detox-boosting compound I profiled in chapters 9 and 11, is derived nearly exclusively from cruciferous vegetables. You could eat tons of other kinds of greens and vegetables on a given day and get no appreciable sulforaphane if you didn’t eat something cruciferous. It’s the same with flaxseeds and the anticancer lignan compounds. As I mentioned in chapters 11 and 13, flax may average one hundred times more lignans than other foods. And mushrooms aren’t even plants at all; they belong to an entirely different biological classification and may contain nutrients (like ergothioneine) not made anywhere in the plant kingdom.2 (So technically, maybe I should be referring to a whole-food, plant- and fungus-based diet, but that just sounds kind of gross.)

It seems like every time I come home from the medical library buzzing with some exciting new data, my family rolls their eyes, sighs, and asks, “What can’t we eat now?” Or they’ll say, “Wait a second. 


Why does everything seem to have parsley in it all of a sudden?” My poor family. They’ve been very tolerant.

As the list of foods I tried to fit into my daily diet grew, I made a checklist and had it on a little dry-erase board on the fridge. We would make a game out of ticking off the boxes. This evolved into the Daily Dozen 


Daily Dozen

No. of servings

*** Beans
*	Berries
*** Other fruits
*	Cruciferous Vegetables
**	Greens
**	Other Vegetables
*	Flaxseeds
*	Nuts
*	Spices
*** Whole Grains
5*	Beverages
*	Exercise


By beans, I mean legumes, which comprise all the different kinds of beans, including soybeans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils. While eating a bowl of pea soup or dipping carrots into hummus may not seem like eating beans, it is. You should try to get three servings a day. A serving is defined as a quarter cup of hummus or bean dip; a half cup of cooked beans, split peas, lentils, tofu, or tempeh; or a full cup of fresh peas or sprouted lentils. Though peanuts are technically legumes, nutritionally, I’ve grouped them in the Nuts category, just as I would consider green (snap or string) beans to be better placed in the Other Vegetables category.

A serving of berries is a half cup of fresh or frozen, or a quarter cup of dried. While biologically speaking, avocados, bananas, and even watermelons are technically berries, I’m using the colloquial term for any small edible fruit, which is why I include kumquats and grapes (and raisins) in this category, as well as fruits that are typically thought of as berries but aren’t technically, such as blackberries, cherries, mulberries, raspberries, and strawberries.

For other fruits, a serving is a medium-sized fruit, a cup of cut-up fruit, or a quarter cup of dried fruit. Again, I’m using the colloquial rather than the botanical definition, so I place tomatoes in the Other Vegetables group. (Interestingly, this is something the U.S. Supreme Court actually ruled on in 1893.3 Arkansas decided to have it both ways, declaring tomatoes both the official state fruit and the official state vegetable.4)

Common cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, cabbage, collards, and kale. I recommend at least one serving a day (typically a half cup) and at least two additional servings of greens a day, cruciferous or otherwise. Serving sizes for other greens and vegetables are a cup for raw leafy vegetables, a half cup for other raw or cooked vegetables, and a quarter cup for dried mushrooms.

Everyone should try to incorporate one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds into his or her daily diet, in addition to a serving of nuts or other seeds. A quarter cup of nuts is considered a serving, or two tablespoons of nut or seed butters, including peanut butter. (Chestnuts and coconuts don’t nutritionally count as nuts.)

I also recommend one-quarter teaspoon a day of the spice turmeric, along with any other (salt-free) herbs and spices you may enjoy.

A serving of whole grains can be considered a half cup of hot cereal such as oatmeal, cooked grain such as rice (including the “pseudograins” amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa), cooked pasta, or corn kernels; a cup of ready-to-eat (cold) cereal; one tortilla or slice of bread; half a bagel or english muffin; or three cups of popped popcorn.

The serving size in the beverage category is one glass (twelve ounces), and the recommended five glasses a day is in addition to the water you get naturally from the foods in your diet.

Finally, I advise one daily “serving” of exercise, which can be split up over the day. I recommend ninety minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as brisk (four miles per hour) walking or forty minutes of vigorous activity (such as jogging or active sports) each day. Why so much? I’ll explain my reasoning in the Exercise chapter.

This may all sound like a lot of boxes to check, but it’s not difficult to knock off a bunch at one time. One simple peanut butter and banana sandwich and you just checked off four boxes. Or imagine sitting down to a big salad. Two cups of spinach, a handful of arugula, a handful of toasted walnuts, a half cup of chickpeas, a half cup of red bell pepper, and a small tomato. You just knocked out seven boxes in one dish. Sprinkle on your flax, add a handful of goji berries, and enjoy it with a glass of water and fruit for dessert, and you could wipe out nearly half your daily check boxes in a single meal. And then if you ate it on a treadmill … just kidding!

Do I check off each glass of water I drink? No. In fact, I don’t even use the checklist anymore; I just used it initially as a tool to get me into a routine. Whenever I was sitting down to a meal, I would ask myself, Could I add greens to this? Could I add beans to that? (I always have an open can of beans in the fridge.) Can I sprinkle on some flax or pumpkin seeds, or maybe some dried fruit? The checklist just got me into the habit of thinking, How can I make this meal even healthier?

I also found the checklist helped with grocery shopping. Although I always keep bags of frozen berries and greens in the freezer, if I’m at the store and want to buy fresh produce for the week, it helps me figure out how much kale or blueberries I need.

The checklist also helps me picture what a meal might look like. Looking over the checklist, you’ll see there are three servings each of beans, fruits, and whole grains, and about twice as many veggies in total than any other food component. Glancing at my plate, I can imagine one quarter of it filled with grains, one quarter with legumes, and a half plate filled with vegetables, along with maybe a side salad and fruit for dessert. I prefer one-bowl meals where everything’s mixed together, but the checklist still helps me to visualize. Instead of a big bowl of spaghetti with some veggies and lentils on top, I think of a big bowl of vegetables with some pasta and lentils mixed in. Instead of a big plate of brown rice with some stir-fried vegetables on top, I picture a meal that’s mostly veggies—and oh look! There’s some rice and beans in there too.

But there is no need to be obsessive about the Daily Dozen. On hectic travel days when I’ve burned through my snacks and I’m trying to piece together some semblance of a healthy meal at the airport food court, sometimes I’m lucky if I even hit a quarter of my goals. If you eat poorly on one day, just try to eat better the next. My hope is that the checklist will serve you as a helpful reminder to try to eat a variety of the healthiest foods every day.

But should you eat your veggies raw or cooked? Do you need to choose organic or is conventional okay? What about GMOs? Gluten? All these questions and more will be answered as I go through each of the Daily Dozen in detail in the following chapters.

//*********************************
Beans

Dr. Greger’s Favorite Beans

Black beans, black-eyed peas, butter beans, cannellini beans, chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans), edamame, english peas, great northern beans, kidney beans, lentils (beluga, french, and red varieties), miso, navy beans, pinto beans, small red beans, split peas (yellow or green), and tempeh

Serving Sizes:

¼ cup of hummus or bean dip

½ cup cooked beans, split peas, lentils, tofu, or tempeh

1 cup of fresh peas or sprouted lentils

Daily Recommendation:

3 servings per day

The federal government’s MyPlate campaign was developed to prompt Americans to think about building healthy meals. Most of your plate should be covered with vegetables and grains, preferably whole grains, with the rest of the plate split between fruits and the protein group. Legumes were given special treatment, straddling both the protein and the vegetable groups. They’re loaded with protein, iron, and zinc, as you might expect from other protein sources like meat, but legumes also contain nutrients that are concentrated in the vegetable kingdom, including fiber, folate, and potassium. You get the best of both worlds with beans, all the while enjoying foods that are naturally low in saturated fat and sodium and free of cholesterol.

The most comprehensive analysis of diet and cancer ever performed was published in 2007 by the American Institute for Cancer Research. Sifting through some half a million studies, nine independent research teams from around the globe created a landmark scientific consensus report reviewed by twenty-one of the top cancer researchers in the world. One of their summary cancer-prevention recommendations is to eat whole grains and/or legumes (beans, split peas, chickpeas, or lentils) with every meal.1 Not every week or every day. Every meal!

Having some oatmeal in the morning makes it easy enough to fulfill the whole grains recommendation, but legumes? Who eats beans for breakfast? Well, lots of people around the world do. A traditional English breakfast includes savory combinations of baked beans on toast, mushrooms, and grilled tomatoes. Japanese breakfasts traditionally include miso soup, and many children in India start their days with idli, a type of steamed lentil cake. More familiar ways for American palates to meet the cancer prevention guidelines might be a whole-grain bagel schmeared with hummus. My friend Paul mashes cannellini beans into his oatmeal and swears you can’t even see or taste them. Why not?

Soy

Soybeans are probably the beans Americans are most comfortable incorporating into their breakfasts. Soy milk, for instance, has grown into a billion-dollar business. But soy milk and even tofu are processed foods. When it comes to the nutrients you tend to associate with legumes—fiber, iron, magnesium, potassium, protein, and zinc—about half are lost when soybeans are converted into tofu. However, beans are so healthy that you can throw away half the nutrition and still have a really healthy food. If you do eat tofu, choose varieties made with calcium (you’ll see it in the ingredients list), which can weigh in at a whopping 550 mg of calcium per (3 oz) slice.2

Even better than tofu, though, would be a whole soy food like tempeh, which is a type of fermented soybean patty. If you look closely at tempeh, you can actually see all the little soybeans. I don’t usually eat tempeh for breakfast, but I do like to slice it thin, dip it into a thick flax “egg” mixture (see here for my recipe), dredge it through some rosemary-seasoned whole-grain bread crumbs or coarse blue cornmeal, and bake it in my toaster oven at about 400°F until golden brown. Then I dip it in buffalo hot sauce for a healthier approximation of the chicken wings I enjoyed in my youth.


//***********************************************************
What About GMO Soy?

A prominent scientific journal recently editorialized that although we are now swimming in information about genetically modified crops, much of what we’re being told is wrong—from both sides of the debate. “But a lot of this incorrect information is sophisticated, backed by legitimate-sounding research and written with certitude,” the editorial read, quipping that when it comes to GMOs, a good gauge of a statement’s fallacy may be “the conviction with which it is delivered.”3

Monsanto’s Roundup Ready soybeans are the number-one genetically modified crop, engineered to be resistant to the herbicide Roundup (also sold by Monsanto), which allows farmers to spray the crops to kill weeds while leaving the soy standing.4

Though much debate continues to swarm around the hypothetical risks of GMO crops, the greater concern for human health may be the potential for GMO crops to contain elevated pesticide residues.5 This fear was realized in 2014 when high levels of Roundup pesticides were reported on GMO soybeans (but not on non-GMO or organic soybeans).6 The pesticide levels were considered high compared to maximum allowable residue levels at the time, but were they high enough to have adverse effects on consumers?

Anti-GMO activists point to studies showing Roundup may interfere with embryonic development and disrupt hormones. These studies were, respectively, on sea urchin embryos7 and cells from mouse testicles.8 Blogs scream headlines like “Men! Save Your Testicles,” citing articles with concerning names like “Prepubertal Exposure to Commercial Formulation of the Herbicide Glyphosate Alters Testosterone Levels and Testicular Morphology.”9 But that study was about puberty in rats. I doubt the blog would have gotten as many hits if it had been titled “Men! Save Prepubescent Rats’ Testicles!”10

Am I being too harsh? After all, where could scientists find live human tissue to experiment on? A research team came up with a brilliant solution—study placentas! Millions of women in the United States give birth each year, and the placenta, the temporary organ formed in the uterus to nourish the fetus during pregnancy, is typically incinerated after delivery. Why not test Roundup on human placental tissue? The researchers did so and found that at the concentration that’s sprayed on crops in the fields, the pesticides did indeed have toxic effects on human tissue.11

That finding may help explain the few tentative studies suggesting adverse effects on pesticide workers12,13 and their children,14 but by the time the pesticides enter the food supply, they are highly diluted. Concentrations of Roundup pesticides may only reach a few parts per million in food and a few parts per billion in your body. Researchers, however, discovered the pesticide may still have effects at a few parts per trillion. Even at that minuscule dose, Roundup pesticides were found to have estrogenic effects in vitro, stimulating the growth of estrogen-receptor-positive human breast cancer cells.15

As we saw in chapter 11, though, soy consumption is associated with lower breast cancer risk and improved breast cancer survival. That may be because most GMO soy in the United States is used as feed for chickens, pigs, and cattle, whereas most of the major soy food manufacturers use non-GMO soy. It could also be because the benefits of eating any kind of soy far outweigh the risks. Regardless, why accept any risk at all when you can choose organic soy products, which by law exclude GMOs?

The bottom line is that there is no direct human data suggesting any harm from eating GMO crops, though such studies haven’t been done (which critics say is exactly the point).16 That’s why mandatory labeling on GMO products would be helpful, so that public health researchers can track whether or not GMOs are having any adverse effects.

But I believe it is important to put the GMO issue in perspective. As I’ve tried to show, there are dietary and lifestyle changes we can make that could eliminate most heart disease, strokes, diabetes, and cancer. Millions of lives could be saved. For this reason, I’m sympathetic to the biotech industry’s exasperation about GMO concerns when we still have people dropping dead from everything else they’re eating.17 As one review concluded: “Consumption of genetically modified food entails risk of undesirable effects similar to the consumption of traditional food.”18 In other words, buying the non-GMO Twinkie isn’t doing your body much good.

Miso is another fermented whole soy food. This thick paste is commonly mixed with hot water to make a delicious soup that’s a staple in Japanese cuisine. If you want to give it a try, I suggest white miso, which has a mellower flavor than red miso. Making miso soup can be as easy as mixing one tablespoon of miso with two cups of hot water and whatever vegetables you prefer. That’s it!

Because miso may contain probiotic bacteria,19 it’s probably best not to actually cook the miso, lest the good bugs be wiped out. When I prepare it, I boil dried mushrooms, a pinch of arame seaweed, a few sun-dried tomatoes, and greens in a pot and ladle off about a quarter cup of hot broth into a large bowl, add the miso, and mash it with a fork until only a thin paste remains. I then pour the rest of the soup into the bowl and stir to combine it with the miso. And, because I’m a bit of a hot-sauce freak, I add some Sriracha for a little kick. My new favorite addition is freshly toasted sesame seeds. I pour out a layer of raw, hulled sesame seeds, put them in the toaster oven until they just start to turn golden, and then throw them sizzling into the soup. Makes the whole kitchen smell heavenly.

Miso Soup: Soy Versus Sodium

The process of producing miso involves adding salt—lots of salt. A single bowl of miso soup could contain half the American Heart Association’s recommended daily limit, which is why I always reflexively avoided it when I’d see it on a menu. But when I actually looked into it, I was surprised by what I found.

There are two principal reasons to avoid salt: stomach cancer and high blood pressure. Considered a “probable cause” of stomach cancer,20 excess salt intake may cause thousands of cases every year in the United States.21 The elevated stomach cancer risk associated with salt intake appears on par with that of smoking or heavy alcohol use but may only be half as bad as opium use22 or a daily serving of meat. A study of nearly a half-million people found that a daily portion of meat (about the size of a deck of cards) was associated with up to five times the odds of stomach cancer.23

This may explain why people eating plant-based diets appear to be at significantly lower risk.24 But it’s not just sodium-rich animal products like processed meats and salted fish that are associated with higher stomach cancer risk—pickled plant foods are as well.25 Kimchi, a spicy pickled vegetable side dish, is a staple in Korean cuisine and could help explain why that country may have the highest stomach cancer rates in the world.26

Miso, however, was not associated with increased cancer risk.27 The carcinogenic effects of the salt may be counteracted by the anticarcinogenic effects of the soy. For example, tofu intake has been associated with about 50 percent less stomach cancer risk28 and salt with about 50 percent more risk,29 which explains how they may effectively cancel each other out. Further protection apparently offered by allium (onion) family vegetables30 may tip the cancer-fighting scale in favor of miso soup that’s garlicky or has some scallions thrown in.

Cancer isn’t the primary reason people are told to avoid salt, though. What about miso soup and high blood pressure? There may be a similar relationship. The salt in miso may push up your blood pressure while the soy protein in miso may lower it back down.31 For example, if you compare the effects of soy milk to skim milk (to make a fairer comparison by removing the saturated butterfat factor), soy milk lowers blood pressure about nine times more effectively than skim dairy milk.32 Would the benefits of soy be enough to counter the effects of the salt in miso, though? Japanese researchers decided to find out.

Over a four-year period, they tracked men and women in their sixties who started out with normal blood pressures to see who was more likely to be diagnosed with high blood pressure: those who had two or more bowls of miso soup a day or those who had one or less. Two bowls a day would be like adding half a teaspoon of salt to your daily diet, yet those who consumed at least that much miso were found to have five times lower risk of becoming hypertensive. The researchers concluded: “Our results on miso-soup have shown that [the] anti-hypertensive effect of miso is possibly above [the] hypertensive effect of salt.”33 So miso soup may actually be protective overall.

Edamame is about as whole a soy food as you can get. After all, these are soybeans still in their pods. You can buy them frozen and just throw a handful into some boiling water anytime you want a healthy snack. They cook in about five minutes. All you need to do is strain them and, if you’re like me, crack lots of fresh pepper onto the pods and nibble the beans right out. (You can also buy them pre-shelled, but then they’re not as fun to eat.)

On the opposite end of the processing spectrum are plant-based meat alternatives like veggie burgers, which are healthy only insofar as they replace the real thing. Beyond Chicken, for example, has fiber, zero saturated fat, zero cholesterol, and equal protein to and fewer calories than an actual chicken breast (plus presumably less food-poisoning risk). But Beyond Chicken pales in comparison to the nutrition found in the soybeans, yellow peas, and amaranth grain from which it was made. Of course, people choosing these meat alternatives are not standing in the grocery store agonizing between Beyond Chicken Grilled Strips and a bowl of legumes and whole grains. So if fajitas are the foregone conclusion, then it would certainly be healthier to choose the plant-based mock meat to the meat itself. I see the value of these meat-alternative products as healthier transition foods to wean people off the standard American diet. Even if you just stopped there, you’d be better off, but the more you can move toward whole-food nutrition, the better. You don’t want to get stuck at the yellow light.

Peas

Like edamame, raw english peas (also known as shell or garden peas) can be a great au naturel snack. I fell in love with peas in the pod when I first picked them off the vine at a farm my brother and I spent time on one summer as kids. They were like candy. Every year, I look forward to the few weeks I can find them fresh.

Lentils

Lentils are little lens-shaped legumes. (Lenses were actually named after lentils; lens is lentil in Latin.) They gained fame in 1982 upon the discovery of the “lentil effect,” or the ability of lentil consumption to blunt the sugar spike of foods consumed hours later at a subsequent meal.34 Lentils are so rich in prebiotics that they create a feast for your friendly flora, which in turn feed you right back with beneficial compounds, such as propionate, that relax your stomach and slow the rate at which sugars are absorbed into your system.35 Chickpeas and other legumes were found to have a similar influence, and so this phenomenon was later renamed the “second-meal effect.”36

Lentils are already one of the most nutrient-dense legumes. But when sprouted, their antioxidant power doubles (and even quintuples for chickpeas).37 Lentils can be easily sprouted into one of the healthiest possible snacks. I was amazed when I first tried making them. What start out looking like hard little pebbles transform into tender morsels in just a couple of days. Why add protein powder to your smoothies when you can add sprouted lentils? In a sprouting jar, or simply a mason jar covered with cheesecloth secured with a rubber band, soak lentils overnight in water, drain, and then rinse and drain twice daily for another couple of days. Sprouting to me is like gardening on steroids—I can create fresh produce in three days right on my kitchen counter. (Of course, if you open a can of lentils, you can enjoy them in about three seconds.)

Are Canned Beans as Healthy as Home Cooked?

Canned beans are convenient, but are they as nutritious as home cooked? A recent study discovered that indeed canned beans are as healthy as boiled beans—with one exception: sodium. Salt is often added to canned beans, resulting in sodium levels up to one hundred times more than if you cooked them without any salt.38 Draining and rinsing your canned beans can remove about half the added salt, but then you’d also be rinsing away some of the nutrition. I recommend purchasing the no-salt-added varieties and cooking with the bean liquid in whatever dish you’re whipping up.

Home-cooked beans may come out tastier, particularly texture-wise. Canned beans can sometimes be a bit mushy, whereas when properly soaked and cooked, beans can come out nice and firm yet tender. Using dried beans is also cheaper. Some bean-counting researchers found that canned beans can be about three times as expensive as home cooked, but the difference only came out to about twenty cents per serving.39 My family chooses to spend that extra twenty cents to save the hours beans can take to cook.

The only legumes I have the patience to cook from scratch are lentils. They cook quickly and don’t need to be presoaked. You can just simmer them as you would pasta, in a pot with an abundance of water, for about half an hour. In fact, if you’re making pasta and have the time, why not let some lentils boil in the water for twenty minutes before adding in the pasta? Lentils are great in spaghetti sauce. That’s what I do when I make rice or quinoa: I throw a handful of dried lentils into the rice cooker, and they’re done when the grain is cooked. Mashed and seasoned cooked lentils also make a great veggie dip. Double check marks!

Dipping veggies in hummus is a double-check-box snack. And don’t forget other bean blending, from garlicky white bean spreads and pinto pâtés to spicy black bean dip. Another fantastic snack (can you tell I love snacking?) is roasted chickpeas. Google it. My favorite, not surprisingly, is the buffalo ranch flavor (from the Kid Tested Firefighter Approved blog40), using a silicone baking mat.

Mealtime options can include dishes like bean burritos; chili; pasta e fagioli; red beans and rice; minestrone; Tuscan white bean stew; and black bean, lentil, or split pea soup. My mom turned me on to dehydrated precooked pea soup mixes. (The lowest sodium brand I’ve been able to find is from Dr. John McDougall’s food line.) You simply add the mix to boiling water with some frozen greens and stir. (Whole Foods Market sells inexpensive one-pound frozen bags of a prechopped blend of kale, collard, and mustard greens. Couldn’t be easier!) I pack pea soup mix when I travel. It’s lightweight, and I can prepare it in the hotel room coffeemaker.

Big Bucks on Beans’ Benefits

For more than a decade, soy foods have enjoyed the rare privilege of an “FDA-approved” food-label health claim about soy’s ability to protect against heart disease. A billion-dollar industry, Big Soy has a lot of money to fund research touting the benefits of their bean. But is soy really the top bean, or are other legumes just as powerful? It turns out that non-soy beans, including lentils, lima beans, navy beans, and pinto beans, drop bad cholesterol levels41 as effectively as soy protein.42 One study, for example, found that eating a half a cup a day of cooked pinto beans for two months may drop your cholesterol by nineteen points.43

One of my favorite go-to quickie meals starts with toasting some corn tortillas. (Food for Life, the same company that makes Ezekiel bread, makes a sprouted yellow corn tortilla usually sold in the frozen section.) Then I mash some canned beans on them with a fork and add a spoonful or two of jarred salsa. All the better if I have fresh cilantro, salad greens, or avocado to top it all off. If I’m lucky enough to have fresh collard greens, I’ll steam a few leaves and use them as burrito wraps to replace the tortillas. We call them collardritos in our house. Greens and beans—can’t get healthier than that!

Any leguminous dessert options? Three words: black-bean brownies. I don’t have a recipe of my own, but if you poke around online, you’ll find many good ones, including the one Dr. Joel Fuhrman shared on The Dr. Oz Show, which uses almond butter as the green-light source of fat and dates as the green-light source of sugar.44

Mostly, I just add beans to whatever I happen to be making. I try to always keep an open can front and center in the fridge as a reminder. We buy black beans by the case. (Black beans appear to have more phenolic phytonutrients than other common legumes,45 but the best bean is probably whichever one you’ll eat the most of!)

Clearing the Air About Beans and Gas

Beans, beans. Good for your heart. The more you eat ’em, the … longer you live? Legumes have been found to be “the most important predictor of survival in older people”46 around the globe. Whether it was the Japanese eating soy products, the Swedes eating brown beans and peas, or those in the Mediterranean region eating lentils, chickpeas, and white beans, legume intake was consistently associated with a longer life span. Researchers found an 8 percent reduction in risk of premature death for every twenty-gram increase in daily legume intake—that’s barely two tablespoons’ worth!47

So why aren’t more people taking advantage of this dietary “fountain of youth”? Fear of flatulence.48 Is that really the choice you’re left with, then? Breaking wind or breaking down? Passing gas or passing on?

Are the concerns about the gassiness of beans just a bunch of hot air?

When researchers tried adding a half cup of beans to people’s diets, the majority experienced no symptoms at all. Even among people who did get gassy, 70 percent or more reported that it diminished by the second or third week of the study. The researchers concluded: “People’s concerns about excessive flatulence from eating beans may be exaggerated.”49

Flatulence may be more common than you think. Americans report passing gas an average of fourteen times a day,50 with the normal range extending up to twenty-three times daily.51 Flatulence comes from two places: swallowed air and fermentation in the bowel. Factors that might cause you to swallow extra air include chewing gum, wearing ill-fitting dentures, sucking on hard candies, drinking through a straw, eating too fast, talking while you eat, and smoking cigarettes. So, if the fear of lung cancer doesn’t get you to quit smoking, maybe fear of flatulence will.

The main source of gas, though, is the normal bacterial fermentation in the colon of undigested sugars. Dairy products are a leading cause of excessive flatulence,52 which is due to poor digestion of the milk sugar lactose.53 One of the most flatulent patients ever reported in the medical literature was effectively cured once all dairy products were removed from his diet. The case, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine and submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records, involved a man who, after consuming dairy, experienced “70 passages in one four-hour period.”54 Cutting the cheese, indeed.

Long term, most people bulking up on high-fiber plant foods do not appear to have significantly increased problems with gas.55 The buoyancy of floating stools from trapped gases can in fact be seen as a sign of adequate fiber intake.56 The indigestible sugars in beans that make it down to your colon may even function as prebiotics to feed your good bacteria and make for a healthier colon.

Even if at first they make you gassy, beans are so health promoting that you should experiment with ways to keep them in your diet at all costs. Lentils, split peas, and canned beans tend to produce less gas, and tofu isn’t usually an offender. Repeated soakings of dried beans in water containing a quarter teaspoon of baking soda per gallon57 and tossing out the cooking water may help if you boil your own beans. Of the spices that have been tested, cloves, cinnamon, and garlic seem to be the most gas reducing, followed by turmeric (but only if uncooked), pepper, and ginger.58 If worse comes to worst, there are cheap supplements that contain alpha-galactosidase, an enzyme shown to break up the bean sugars and take the sail out of your wind.59

Odor is a separate issue. The smell appears to come primarily from the digestion of sulfur-rich foods. So to cut down on the stench, experts have recommended cutting back on such foods as meat and eggs.60 (Hydrogen sulfide is called “rotten egg gas” for a reason.) This may be why people who eat meat regularly were found to generate as much as fifteen times the sulfides as those eating plant-based diets.61

There are healthy sulfur-rich foods, such as garlic and cauliflower. If you’re about to embark on a long trip in a confined space after a big meal of aloo gobi, Pepto-Bismol and generic equivalents can act as a windbreaker by binding up the sulfur in your gut to eliminate odors. But this should be used only as a short-term solution due to the potential for bismuth toxicity with chronic use.62

Then there are the high-tech solutions, such as carbon-fiber, odor-eating underwear (cost: $65), which were put to the test in a series of studies that included such gems as “Utilizing gas-tight Mylar pantaloons, the ability of a charcoal-lined cushion to absorb sulfur-containing gases instilled at the anus of eight subjects was assessed.”63 The name of the charcoal-lined cushion? The “Toot Trapper.”

The bottom line: Intestinal gas is normal and healthy. No less an expert than Hippocrates himself was attributed as saying, “Passing gas is necessary to well-being.”64 In a review of degassing drugs and devices, Dr. John Fardy, a chair of gastroenterology, wrote: “Perhaps increased tolerance of flatus would be a better solution, for we tamper with harmless natural phenomena at our peril.”65 And, yes, Dr. Fardy is his real name.

Legume consumption is associated with a slimmer waist and lower blood pressure, and randomized trials have shown it can match or beat out calorie cutting for slimming tummy fat as well as improving the regulation of blood sugar, insulin levels, and cholesterol. Beans are packed with fiber, folate, and phytates, which may help reduce the risk of stroke, depression, and colon cancer. The phytoestrogens in soy in particular appear to both help prevent breast cancer and improve breast cancer survival. No wonder the cancer guidelines suggest you should try to fit beans into your meals—and it’s so easy! They can be added to nearly any meal, easily incorporated into snack times, or served as the star attraction. The possibilities are endless.

Berries

Dr. Greger’s Favorite Berries

Açai berries, barberries, blackberries, blueberries, cherries (sweet or tart), concord grapes, cranberries, goji berries, kumquats, mulberries, raspberries (black or red), and strawberries

Serving Sizes:

½ cup fresh or frozen

¼ cup dried

Daily Recommendation:

1 serving per day

The case for berries has been made throughout this book. Berries offer potential protection against cancer (chapters 4 and 11), a boost to the immune system (chapter 5), and a guard for the liver (chapter 8) and brain (chapters 3 and 14). An American Cancer Society study of nearly one hundred thousand men and women found that those who ate the most berries appeared significantly less likely to die of cardiovascular disease.1

Wait a second—tastes great and may help you live longer? Yes. That’s what plant-based eating is all about.

Greens are the healthiest vegetables, and berries are the healthiest fruits—in part due to their respective plant pigments. Leaves contain the green pigment chlorophyll, which sets off the firestorm of photosynthesis, so greens have to be packed with antioxidants to deal with the charged high-energy electrons that are formed. (Remember superoxide from chapter 3?) Meanwhile, berries evolved to have bright, contrasting colors to attract fruit-eating critters to help disperse their seeds. And the same molecular characteristics that give berries such vibrant colors may account for some of their antioxidant abilities.2

Americans eat a lot of pale and beige foods: white bread, white pasta, white potatoes, white rice. Colorful foods are often healthier because they contain antioxidant pigments, whether it’s the beta-carotene that makes carrots and sweet potatoes orange, the lycopene antioxidant pigment that makes tomatoes red, or the anthocyanin pigments that make blueberries blue. The colors are the antioxidants. That knowledge alone should revolutionize your stroll down the produce aisle.

Guess which have more antioxidants—red onions or white onions? You don’t need to look up the answer. You can see the difference with your own eyes. (Indeed, red onions have 76 percent more antioxidant capacity than white, with yellow onions in between.3) So, given the choice, why buy another white onion ever again?

Red cabbage may contain eight times more antioxidants than green cabbage,4 which is why you’ll never find a green cabbage in my house.

Pop quiz: Which wipes out more free radicals—pink grapefruit or regular grapefruit? Granny Smith or Red Delicious? Iceberg lettuce or romaine? Red grapes or green? Yellow corn or white corn? See, you don’t need me to go to the grocery store with you. You can make all these calls yourself.

What about a purple-skinned eggplant or a white-skinned eggplant? Trick question! Remember, the pigment is the antioxidant, so the color of the skin doesn’t matter if you peel it off. As we learned in chapter 11, that’s why you never want to peel apples. It’s for this same reason kumquats may be the healthiest citrus fruit, since you can eat them rind and all.

Shop for the reddest of strawberries, the blackest of blackberries, the most scarlet tomato, the darkest green broccoli you can find. The colors are the antiaging, anticancer antioxidants.

Antioxidant content is one of the reasons I’ve singled out berries for special treatment. They are second only to herbs and spices as the most antioxidant-packed food category. As a group, they average nearly ten times more antioxidants than other fruits and vegetables (and exceed fifty times more than animal-based foods).5

The Antioxidant Power of Berries

As with other green-light foods, the healthiest variety is the one you’ll eat most often, but if you have no particular preference, why not put the berry with the most antioxidants in your morning oatmeal? Thanks to a study that compared more than a hundred different berries and berry products, we now know which one that is.6

America’s favorite fruits are apples and bananas, with antioxidant power of about 60 units and 40 units, respectively. Mangos, the preferred fruit around the world outside of the United States, have even more antioxidant punch at around 110 units. (It makes sense when you consider how much more colorful they are on the inside.) But none of these fruits are a match for berries. Strawberries weigh in at about 310 units per cup, cranberries at 330, raspberries at 350, blueberries at 380 (though wild blueberries may have twice as much7), and blackberries at a whopping 650 units. Above even those are exotic types you can pick wild in the Arctic tundra, like red whortleberries. (They sound like something from a Dr. Seuss book!) But in terms of what you can find readily in the store, it’s blackberries for the win. (I share my whole-fruit cocktail recipe for using one of the runners-up, cranberries, here.) I’m happy as long as you’re eating a serving of any type of berry every day, but in terms of antioxidant content, choosing blackberries over strawberries appears to give you twice the bang for your berry.8

What About All the Sugar in Fruit?

There are a few popular diets out there that urge people to stop eating fruits because their natural sugars (fructose) are thought to contribute to weight gain. The truth is, only fructose from added sugars appears to be associated with declining liver function,9 high blood pressure, and weight gain.10 How could the fructose in sugar be bad but the same fructose in fruit be harmless? Think about the difference between a sugar cube and a sugar beet. (Beets are the primary source of sugar in the United States.11) In nature, fructose comes prepackaged with the fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients that appear to nullify adverse fructose effects.12

Studies show that if you drink a glass of water with three tablespoons of sugar (similar to what would be in a can of soda), you’ll have a big spike in your blood sugar levels within the first hour. That causes your body to release so much insulin to mop up the excess sugar that you actually overshoot and become hypoglycemic by the second hour, meaning that your blood sugar drops even lower than it would if you were fasting. Your body detects this low blood sugar, thinks you might be in some sort of famine situation, and responds by dumping fat into your bloodstream as an energy source to keep you alive.13 This excess fat in the blood can then go on to cause further problems. (See chapter 6.)

But what if you eat a cup of blended berries in addition to the sugar? The berries, of course, have sugars of their own—an additional tablespoon’s worth—so the blood sugar spike should be even worse, right? Actually, no. Study participants who ate berries with their cup of sugar water showed no additional blood sugar spike and no hypoglycemic dip afterward; their blood sugar levels merely went up and down, and there was no surge of fat into the blood.14

Consuming sugar in fruit form is not only harmless but actually helpful. Eating berries can blunt the insulin spike from high-glycemic foods like white bread, for example.15 This may be because the fiber in fruit has a gelling effect in your stomach and small intestine that slows the release of sugars16 or because of certain phytonutrients in fruit that appear to block the absorption of sugar through the gut wall and into your bloodstream.17 So eating fructose the way nature intended carries benefits rather than risks.

Low-dose fructose may actually benefit blood sugar control. Eating a piece of fruit with each meal could be expected to lower, rather than raise, the blood sugar response.18 What about people with type 2 diabetes? Diabetics randomized into a group restricted to no more than two daily pieces of fruit had no better blood sugar control than those randomized into a group told to eat a minimum of two pieces of fruit per day. The researchers concluded that “the intake of fruit should not be restricted in patients with type 2 diabetes.”19

Surely there must be some level of fructose consumption that’s harmful even when served in Mother Nature’s green-light form, right? Apparently not.

Seventeen people were asked to eat twenty servings of fruit per day for months. Despite the extraordinarily high fructose content of this fruit-based diet—the sugar equivalent of about eight cans of soda a day—the investigators reported beneficial outcomes with no overall adverse effects for body weight, blood pressure,20 insulin, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.21 More recently, the research group who invented the glycemic index found that feeding subjects a fruit-, vegetable-, and nut-based diet that included about twenty servings of fruit per day for a couple of weeks had no adverse effects on weight, blood pressure, or triglycerides—all while lowering LDL (“bad”) cholesterol by an astounding thirty-eight points.22

Cholesterol lowering was not the only record broken: Participants were asked to eat forty-three servings of vegetables a day in addition to the fruit, the result of which was that the researchers recorded the largest-ever bowel movements documented in a dietary intervention.23

Are frozen berries as nutritious as fresh ones? Studies on cherries,24 raspberries,25 and strawberries26 suggest that most of their nutrition is retained even when frozen. I usually opt for frozen berries since they last longer, are available year round, and tend to be cheaper. If you looked in our freezer right now, you’d see it’s about half frozen greens and half frozen berries. What do I do with those berries? Make ice cream, of course.

The favored dessert in our home is soft-serve “ice cream” made by blending frozen fruit. You whip up frozen fruit in a blender, food processor, or juicer, and voilà! Instant all-fruit ice cream. You have to taste it to believe it. The simplest recipe has one ingredient: frozen bananas. Peel and freeze some ripe bananas (the riper, the better—I’m talking brown). Once frozen, throw them in a food processor and blend. They transform into a smooth, light, fluffy dessert cheaper, healthier, and tastier than anything you might get in a trendy frozen yogurt shop.

Of course making berry ice cream or at least a berry-banana mix is even healthier. My favorite is chocolate. To make it, blend dark, sweet cherries or strawberries mixed with a tablespoon of cocoa power, a splash of a milk of your choice (more if you want a milkshake), a capful of vanilla extract, and some pitted dates. If you didn’t yet get your nuts for the day, you can add some almond butter. Either way, you get an instant, decadent, chocolate dessert so nutritious that the more you eat, the healthier you are. Let me repeat that: The more you eat, the healthier you are. That’s my kind of ice cream!

Tart Cherries

Research dating back half a century suggests tart cherries are so anti-inflammatory that they can be used to successfully treat a painful type of arthritis called gout.27 Delicious dietary treatments are much welcomed, as some gout drugs can cost $2,000 a dose,28 carry no clear-cut distinction between nontoxic, toxic, and lethal doses,29 or can cause a rare side effect in which your skin detaches from your body.30 Of course, the best way to deal with gout is to try to prevent it in the first place with a more plant-based diet.31

Cherries can reduce the level of inflammation among healthy people too (as measured by a drop in C-reactive protein levels),32 so I was excited to find a green-light source available year-round—a canned product with only two ingredients: cherries and water. I drain off the liquid (which then goes into my hibiscus punch recipe here) and mix the cherries in a bowl of cooked oatmeal along with cocoa powder and pumpkin seeds. If you sweeten it with date sugar or erythritol (see here), it’s like eating chocolate-covered cherries for breakfast.

A note of caution: For the same reason that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin should be avoided during the third trimester of pregnancy, cocoa, berries, and other foods high in anti-inflammatory polyphenols should only be eaten in moderation in late pregnancy.33

Goji Berries

Tart cherries naturally contain melatonin and have been used to improve sleep without any side effects.34 Goji berries, however, have the highest concentrations of melatonin.35 Gojis have the third-highest antioxidant capacity of any common dried fruit—five times more than raisins and second only to dried pomegranate seeds and barberries (a fruit commonly found in Middle Eastern markets and spice stores).36 Gojis also have a specific antioxidant pigment that makes corn yellow—zeaxanthin. When eaten, zeaxanthin is shuttled into your retinas (the back of your eyes) and appears to protect against macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss.37

The egg industry boasts about the zeaxanthin content in yolks, but goji berries have about fifty times more than eggs.38 A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that gojis may even help people already suffering from macular degeneration.39 The researchers used milk to improve the absorption of zeaxanthin (which, like all carotenoids, is fat soluble), but a healthier way would be to use green-light sources of fat, such as nuts and seeds—in other words, goji trail mix!

Aren’t goji berries expensive, though? In natural foods stores, they can go for twenty dollars a pound, but in Asian supermarkets, you can buy them as “Lycium” berries, and they’re even cheaper than raisins. So, however you used to eat raisins—as a snack, in baked goods, in your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, whatever—I recommend you make the switch to gojis.

Black Currants and Bilberries

Speaking of berries and eyesight, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of black currants found they can improve the symptoms of computer eye strain (known in doctor-speak as “video display terminal work-induced transient refractive alteration”).40 What passes for currants in the United States are usually champagne grape raisins, not actual black currants, which were banned in the country a century ago at the behest of the lumber industry. (The industry feared they might spread a plant disease that affects white pines, a tree we hardly harvest anymore, so the ban has since been lifted in some states.) Real black currants are currently making a comeback, but if—as the researchers suspected—the benefits have to do with the anthocyanin pigments, other berries like bilberries, blueberries, or blackberries may help as well. Anthocyanin pigments are responsible for many of the intense blue, black, purple, and red colors of berries and other fruits and vegetables. The highest concentrations are found in aronia berries and elderberries, followed by black raspberries, blueberries (especially the smaller “wild” varieties), and blackberries. The cheapest source, though, is probably red cabbage.41

Bilberries gained notoriety during World War II when it was said that pilots in the British Royal Air Force “were eating bilberry jam to improve their night vision.”42 It turns out this may have been a story concocted to fool the Germans. The more likely reason the Brits were able to suddenly target Nazi bombers in the middle of the night wasn’t because of bilberries but thanks to a top-secret new invention: radar.

Unfortunately, these anthocyanin pigments take a hit when berries are processed into jam. As much as 97 percent of anthocyanins are lost when strawberries are turned into strawberry jam.43 Freeze-drying, however, appears to be remarkably nutrient preserving.44 I remember trying “astronaut ice cream” as a kid when I visited the Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum. That’s what freeze-dried strawberries taste like to me. They just melt in your mouth. Delicious, nutritious, but expensive.

Fresh berries, of course, are divine. My family enjoys pick-your-own outings and then freezes the abundance. I’ve also been known to lay a sheet under branches of mulberry trees that grow in a park by our house and gently knock down a ripe bounty with a broom handle. Evidently, nearly all wild “aggregate” berries (meaning berries that look like clusters of little balls, like blackberries, raspberries, and mulberries) in North America are edible,45 but please be sure you make an ironclad identification before foraging.

*   *   *

Berries in all their colorful, sweet, and flavorful glory are protective little antioxidant powerhouses. The issue shouldn’t be how you are going to get your one minimum daily serving but rather how you are going to pry yourself away from them. In your smoothie, as a dessert, on your salad, or just popped right into your mouth—they are nature’s candy.

Other Fruits

Dr. Greger’s Favorite Other Fruits

Apples, dried apricots, avocados, bananas, cantaloupe, clementines, dates, dried figs, grapefruit, honeydew, kiwifruit, lemons, limes, lychees, mangos, nectarines, oranges, papaya, passion fruit, peaches, pears, pineapple, plums (especially black plums), pluots, pomegranates, prunes, tangerines, and watermelon

Serving Sizes:

1 medium-sized fruit

1 cup cut-up fruit

¼ cup dried fruit

Daily Recommendation:

3 servings per day

It took years for nearly five hundred researchers from more than three hundred institutions in fifty countries to develop the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study. Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, it is the largest analysis of risk factors for death and disease in history.1 In the United States, the massive study determined that the leading cause of both death and disability was the American diet, followed by smoking.2 What did they determine to be the worst aspect about our diet? Not eating enough fruit.3

Don’t limit yourself to eating fruit just the way it comes plucked off the tree. Although fruit makes for a perfect, quick snack, don’t forget that it can be cooked as well. Think baked apples, poached pears, and grilled pineapple.

If you like drinking your fruit, blending is better than juicing to preserve nutrition. Juicing removes more than just fiber. Most of the polyphenol phytonutrients (see chapter 3) in fruits and vegetables appear to be bound to the fiber and are only liberated for absorption by the friendly flora in your gut. When you merely drink the juice, you lose out on the fiber and all the nutrition that was attached to it.4 Even just cloudy apple juice, which retains a bit of the fruit fiber, appears to have nearly triple the phenolics compared to clear apple juice.5

Whereas greater consumption of whole fruits has been associated with a lower likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, Harvard University researchers found that greater juice consumption was associated with higher diabetes risk. So, by choosing yellow-light sources of fruit, like juice or jelly, you may not only be missing out on nutrients but actively working against your health.6

An Apple a Day

Anyone who says they don’t have time to eat healthfully has never met an apple. Talk about a convenience food! For those who grew up in a world dominated by Red Delicious and Granny Smith, I’m happy to report there are thousands of varieties. Health-wise, crab apples (gross!) probably top the charts,7 but taste-wise, my personal favorite is Honeycrisp—or any pick-your-own variety I can find locally. If you’ve never tried an apple you picked right off a tree, you don’t know what you’re missing. Failing that, farmers’ markets can offer good deals on great produce. My family buys apples by the half bushel.

Dates

My favorite fruit snack in the fall and winter is apple slices with dates, for the perfect mix of tart and sweet. Growing up, I never liked dates. They tasted dry and kind of waxy. But then I discovered there were soft, plump, moist varieties that didn’t taste like the chalky ones that haunted my childhood. Barhi dates, for example, are wet and sticky, but when frozen, they acquire the taste and chew of caramel candy. Seriously. Paired with my Honeycrisp, it’s like eating a butterscotch-flavored caramel apple.

Locally, you should be able to find decent Medjool dates in Middle Eastern grocery stores and many natural foods markets, but for the too-moist-to-be-sold-commercially varieties, you’ll probably have to shop online. I have tried dates from most of the major online retailers and always go back to ordering from the Date People, a small farm in California. I am averse to commercial endorsements, but I’ve never tasted consistently better dates from any other source (although Black Sphinx dates from Phoenix come close!). Date People’s annual harvest comes in around my birthday in October, and I always splurge as a present to myself and get a big box to put in our freezer.

Olives and Olive Oil

Olives and extra-virgin olive oil are yellow-light foods. Olive consumption should be minimized because they’re soaked in brine—a dozen large olives could take up nearly half your recommended sodium limit for an entire day. Olive oil is sodium-free, but most of its nutrition has been removed. You can think of extra-virgin olive oil a little like fruit juice: It has nutrients, but the calories you get are relatively empty compared to those from the whole fruit. (Olives are, after all, fruits.)

Freshly squeezed olive juice already has less nutrition than the whole fruit, but then olive-oil producers also throw away the olive wastewater, which contains the water-soluble nutrients. As a result, you end up getting just a small fraction of the nutrition of the whole fruit by the time extra-virgin olive oil is bottled. Refined olive oil (nonvirgin) is even worse. I would classify it, along with other vegetable oils, as red-light foods, as they offer such scant nutrition for their heavy caloric loads. One tablespoon of oil can contain more than one hundred calories without filling you up. (Compare that single tablespoon to the one-hundred-calorie serving sizes of other foods here.)

I think of oil as the table sugar of the fat kingdom. Similar to the way manufacturers take healthy foods like beets and throw out all their nutrition to make sugar, they take wholesome corn and scorch-earth it down to corn oil. Like sugar, corn oil calories may be worse than just empty. In chapter 1, I touched on the impairment of artery function that can occur within hours of eating red-light fare like fast food and cheesecake. The same detrimental effect happens after the consumption of olive oil8 and other oils9 (but not after eating green-light sources of fat like nuts).10 Even extra-virgin olive oil may impair your arteries’ ability to relax and dilate normally.11 So, like any yellow-light food, its use should be curtailed.

Cooking without oil is surprisingly easy. To keep foods from sticking, you can sauté in wine, sherry, broth, vinegar, or just plain water. For baking, I’ve successfully used green-light ingredients such as mashed bananas or avocado, soaked prunes, and even canned pumpkin to substitute for oil to provide a similar moistness.

The reduction of yellow-light foods is all about frequency and quantity. If you are going to trek outside the green zone, my advice is simple: Make it count. Don’t waste precious indulgences on crappy food. I don’t want to sound like a food snob, but if you’re going to eat something less than maximally healthy, I say pamper yourself and truly relish it. When I eat olives, there’s no way I’m going to eat those waxy black abominations in a can. I’m going to slice up some purple kalamatas that actually have some flavor. If you’re going to spoil yourself once in a while, I say do it right!

Mangos

Mangos are my favorite fruit treat during spring and summer, but you have to know where to look to get good ones. Check out Hispanic markets and Indian grocery stores. The difference between a mango from Walmart and one from an Indian spice store is like the difference between a hard, pale, tasteless, pink tomato and a ripe, flavorful, farm-stand heirloom. You should be able to smell the mango at arm’s length.

My favorite way to eat a mango is like sipping a Capri Sun drink pouch. When the fruit gets soft and ripe, I roll it between my palms, kneading it with my fingers until it becomes essentially liquid pulp in a pouch. Then I nip off the tip with my teeth, gently squeeze, and suck the mango right out of its peel.

Watermelon

Are some whole fruits better than others? Berries contain the most antioxidants, whereas melons wallow down around iceberg lettuce levels. Watermelon seeds, on the other hand, have pretty respectable antioxidant levels, so I try to avoid seedless varieties. A spoonful of watermelon seeds may have as many antioxidants as a whole cup of melon balls.12 Seedless or not, watermelon contains a compound called citrulline that can boost the activity of the enzyme responsible for dilating the blood vessels in the penis that result in erections. A group of Italian researchers found that citrulline supplementation at the level of five servings of red watermelon a day improved erection hardness in men with mild erectile dysfunction, allowing for a 68 percent increase in monthly intercourse frequency.13 Yellow watermelon has four times more citrulline,14 though, so just about one wedge a day (one-sixteenth of a modest melon) may have the same effect. If this information is new to you, perhaps it’s because the advertising budgets of drug companies like Pfizer, which rake in billions of dollars each year from the sale of erectile dysfunction drugs, are about a thousand times15 that of the entire budget of the National Watermelon Promotion Board.16

Dried Fruit

I love dried mangos, but they are hard to find without added sugar. I remember naïvely asking a friend in the food business why the industry felt the need to sugar-up an already sweet fruit. “Added weight,” he explained. Just as poultry processors inject salt water into chickens to add water weight, processed food companies often use sugar as a cheap way to bulk up products sold by the pound.

This made me determined to make my own. I bought an inexpensive dehydrator from eBay, and I’m so glad I did. Fruit is about 90 percent water, so imagine intensifying the flavor of a fresh, ripe mango tenfold. Mind-blowing! Mangos can be a messy pain to peel, but once that’s done, I slice them about a centimeter thick and sprinkle them with chia seeds before putting them in the dehydrator. If I’m taking them on a plane or a hike, I’ll dry them completely. Otherwise, I only wait until just the outside is dry. The outer layer, encrusted with chia, gets a crispy texture while the core remains moist and ready to burst. It’s the kind of thing I can’t eat while watching a movie or reading a book. It tastes so good I just have to stop, close my eyes, and savor it.

I also like drying thin apple slices. I either sprinkle them with cinnamon or rub them with freshly grated ginger. They can be just dried until chewy or completely dehydrated into crunchy apple chips. Eating a dozen dried apple rings a day may drop LDL cholesterol levels 16 percent within three months and 24 percent within six months.17

If you buy dried fruit, I recommend choosing unsulfured varieties. Sulfur-containing preservatives, such as sulfur dioxide in dried fruit and sulfites in wine, can form hydrogen sulfide in your gut—this is the rotten egg gas implicated in the development of the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis. The main source of hydrogen sulfide is the metabolism of animal protein,18 but you can further lower your exposure by avoiding sulfur additives (either by reading labels or choosing organic, in which such preservatives are forbidden). The sulfur naturally contained in cruciferous vegetables does not appear to elevate colitis risk,19 so feel free to add kale chips to your healthy snacking menu.

Prescribing Kiwifruit

There appear to be a disproportionate number of articles in the medical literature about the clinical benefits of kiwifruit. Is that because they’re better than other fruits? Or is it because the kiwi industry has more research dollars? One country, New Zealand, holds a substantial share of the global kiwi market, so it’s in its best interest to underwrite research on the fruit. As a result, there is no shortage of papers touting the benefits of kiwifruit.

Kiwi is one of the fruits I’ve prescribed to my patients with insomnia (two an hour before bedtime appears to significantly improve sleep onset, duration, and efficiency)20 and also to help with constipation-type irritable bowel syndrome (two kiwifruit a day seem to significantly improve bowel function). Kiwi certainly seems like a better option than the leading IBS drug, which was pulled from the market for apparently killing too many people.21

Kiwifruit also appear to benefit immune function. Preschoolers randomized to eat gold kiwifruits every day appeared to cut their risk of contracting a cold or flu-like illness nearly in half compared to those randomly selected to eat bananas instead.22 A similar experiment was tried on elderly individuals, another high-risk group. Those in the banana control group who got an upper-respiratory-tract infection suffered for about five days with a sore throat and congestion, compared to the kiwifruit eaters, who felt better after just a day or two.23 About 1 in 130 children may be allergic to kiwifruit, though,24 which may rank kiwis as the third-most-common food allergen (second only to milk and eggs),25 so they are not for everyone.

Citrus

Adding citrus zest to your meals not only adds color, flavor, aroma, and a bit of culinary flair but also nutrition. Citrus zest lives up to its name in terms of enlivening dishes, and it may do the same to your DNA-repair capabilities. On average, humans appear to suffer eight hundred hits to their DNA per hour. If not fixed, this can cause mutations that give rise to cancer.26 Comparing identical and fraternal twins, researchers have determined that only part of your DNA-repair function is determined genetically. The rest may be under your control.27

The dietary factor found best able to boost DNA repair was citrus fruit.28 Within two hours of consuming citrus, your DNA becomes significantly more resistant to damage,29 which may help explain why citrus consumption is associated with lower risk of breast cancer.30 Some of the citrus compounds thought responsible—which concentrate in the breast31 and enhance DNA repair32—are found in the peel, though. This may be why people who eat at least some citrus peel appear to have lower skin cancer rates than those who don’t.33

Stick with the whole fruit, because supplements don’t appear to boost DNA repair,34 and citrus juice doesn’t appear to help, either. In fact, drinking orange juice every morning may even increase skin cancer risk.35 Green-light forms of foods always seem to be the best, and you can eat citrus in an even less processed way by slipping some of the rind into your diet through zesting. I like to freeze lemons, limes, and oranges whole so we always have them on hand to grate onto meals that could use a little zing.

My only whole-citrus caveat: Inform your physician if you eat grapefruit. This fruit can suppress the enzymes that help clear more than half of commonly prescribed drugs, and less drug clearance means higher drug levels in the body.36 This may actually be good if you want a better caffeine buzz from your morning coffee37 or if your doctor wants to help you save money by boosting the effects of expensive drugs instead of just peeing them away.38 But higher drug levels may also mean higher risk of side effects, so if you regularly eat grapefruits, your physician may want to change your prescription or alter the dosing.

Exotic Fruits

The medical school I attended sits in the middle of Boston’s Chinatown. I remember the first time I perused the produce aisle at a large Asian supermarket. With options from bizarre-looking dragon fruit to tribble-like rambutans, I felt like I was on another planet. Every week I tried something new. Some stuck with me—I still sneak lychees into the movies—but others were onetime affairs. Let me share with you the Durian Incident.

Durians are the most badass of all fruits. Imagine a five-pound football covered in sharp spikes like some medieval mace. What other fruit could be described in the medical literature as causing “severe body injury” in papers with titles like “Penetrating Ocular Injury by Durian Fruit”?39 And I haven’t even gotten to its most distinctive quality: its smell. With an odor perhaps best described as “pig-shit, turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock,”40 durian fruits are banned from many public spaces, like subways and airports, in Southeast Asia, where they are grown.

I had to try eating one of these crazy things!

Durian fruits are sold frozen. (I would soon come to understand why.) I took one back to campus and managed to hack off a piece without impaling myself on a spike. The fruit tasted like a caramelized onion popsicle. I left the rest in my locker. Big mistake! I arrived the next day to find an entire floor of the medical center—including the dean’s office—cordoned off. They were going locker to locker, cutting off all the locks, searching in vain for the cause of a stench so overpowering you couldn’t even locate it. It was like a fog of stink. Hospital staff seriously thought someone had stolen body parts from the gross anatomy cadaver lab. And then it struck me. Uh-oh. The durian had thawed. When I realized it was all my fault, I crawled to the dean to beg forgiveness. I already had a history of run-ins with the administration over issues I had raised about the curriculum, and now this. I’ll never forget what he said to me that day: “Why am I not surprised you had something to do with this?”

*   *   *

When adding as much fruit as possible to your diet, you certainly don’t have to seek out weapons-grade stinky fruit, but you also don’t have to stick with the same old, same old. Treat yourself! Have fun sampling the many varieties of the many different fruits around. How lovely it can be to stroll through your farmers’ market on a weekend and pick up locally grown fruits that you can zest onto your meals, blend into smoothies, chew when dried, incorporate into your favorite dishes, or best of all, bite right into. The opportunities are ripe for the picking!

Cruciferous Vegetables

Dr. Greger’s Favorite Cruciferous Vegetables

Arugula, bok choy, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, horseradish, kale (black, green, and red), mustard greens, radishes, turnip greens, and watercress

Serving Sizes:

½ cup chopped

¼ cup brussels or broccoli sprouts

1 tablespoon horseradish

Daily Recommendation:

1 serving per day

When I used to teach medical students at Tufts, I gave a lecture about this amazing new therapeutic called “iloccorB.” I’d talk about all the evidence supporting it, the great things it could do, and its excellent safety profile. Just as the students would start scrambling to buy stock in the company and prescribe it to their future patients, I’d do the big reveal. Apologizing for my “dyslexia”, I would admit that I’d gotten it backward. All this time, I had been talking about broccoli.

I’ve mentioned broccoli more than any other food in this book, and for good reason. We’ve seen how cruciferous vegetables like broccoli can potentially prevent DNA damage and metastatic cancer spread in chapter 2, activate defenses against pathogens and pollutants in chapter 5, help to prevent lymphoma in chapter 9, boost your liver detox enzymes and target breast cancer stem cells in chapter 11, and reduce the risk of prostate cancer progression in chapter 13. The component responsible for these benefits is thought to be sulforaphane, which is formed almost exclusively in cruciferous vegetables. This is why they get their own spot on the Daily Dozen.

Beyond being a promising anticancer agent,1 sulforaphane may also help protect your brain2 and your eyesight,3 reduce nasal allergy inflammation,4 manage type 2 diabetes,5 and was recently found to successfully help treat autism. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial of boys with autism found that about two to three cruciferous vegetable servings’ worth6 of sulforaphane a day improves social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication within a matter of weeks. The researchers, primarily from Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University, suggest that the effect might be due to sulforaphane’s role as a “detoxicant.”7

Strategies to Enhance Sulforaphane Formation

The formation of sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables is like a chemical flare reaction. It requires the mixing of a precursor compound with an enzyme called myrosinase, which is inactivated by cooking8 (though microwaved broccoli appears to retain some cancer-fighting capacity). This may explain why we see dramatic suppression of test-tube cancer-cell growth by raw broccoli, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts, but hardly any reaction when they’re cooked.9 But who wants to eat raw brussels sprouts? Not me. Thankfully, there are ways to get the benefits of raw vegetables in cooked form.

Biting into broccoli is like snapping that chemical flare. When raw broccoli (or any other cruciferous vegetable) is chopped or chewed, the sulforaphane precursor mixes with the myrosinase enzyme and sulforaphane is created as the vegetable sits on the cutting board or lies in your upper stomach waiting to be digested.10 Though the enzyme is destroyed by cooking, both the precursor and the final product are resistant to heat. So here’s the trick: Use what I call the “Hack and Hold” technique (maybe I should call it Whack and Wait?).

If you chop the broccoli (or brussels sprouts, kale, collards, cauliflower, or any other cruciferous vegetable) and then wait forty minutes, you can cook it as much as you want. At that point, the sulforaphane has already been made, so the enzyme is no longer needed to achieve maximum benefit. It’s already done its job. (You can also buy bags of fresh greens and other crucifers that are prechopped or shredded, which can presumably be cooked immediately.)

Given this understanding, can you see how most people prepare broccoli soup incorrectly? Typically, they first cook the broccoli and then blend it. But, when you blend it, you’re merely mixing the precursor with an enzyme that’s been inactivated by cooking. Do it in the opposite order: First blend your veggies and then wait forty minutes before cooking them. This way, you can maximize sulforaphane production.

What about frozen broccoli and other crucifers? Commercially produced frozen broccoli lacks the ability to form sulforaphane because the vegetables are blanched (flash-cooked) before they’re frozen for the very purpose of deactivating enzymes.11 This process prolongs shelf life, but when you take the veggies out of your freezer, the enzyme is inert. At that point, it doesn’t matter how much you chop or how long you wait—no sulforaphane is going to be made. This may be why fresh kale has been shown to suppress cancer cell growth in vitro up to ten times better than frozen kale.12

******************************** mustard seed powder over cooked cruciferous vegetable
The frozen crucifer is still packed with the precursor, though—remember, it’s heat resistant. You could make lots of sulforaphane from it by adding back some enzyme.13 But where can you get myrosinase? Scientists buy theirs from chemical companies, but you can just walk into any grocery store.

Mustard greens are also cruciferous vegetables. They grow from mustard seeds, which you can buy ground up in the spice aisle as mustard powder. If you sprinkled some mustard powder on frozen broccoli that’s been cooked, would it start churning out sulforaphane? Yes!

Boiling broccoli prevents the formation of any significant levels of sulforaphane due to inactivation of the enzyme. However, the addition of powdered mustard seeds to cooked broccoli significantly increases sulforaphane formation.14 Then it’s almost as good as eating it raw! So, if you don’t have forty minutes to spare between chopping and cooking, or if you’re using frozen greens, just sprinkle the crucifers with some mustard powder before you eat them, and you’ll be all set. Daikon radishes, regular radishes, horseradish, and wasabi are all cruciferous vegetables and may have the same effect. All it appears to take is a pinch to revitalize sulforaphane production.15 You can also add a small amount of fresh greens to your cooked greens. So when I add shreds of purple cabbage to my finished dishes, it not only adds a beautiful garnish with a delightful crunch, it’s filled with the sulforaphane-producing enzyme.

One of my first tasks every morning used to be chopping greens for the day, using my Hack and Hold technique. But now, with the Mustard Powder Plan, I have one less to-do on my list.

Horseradish

The serving sizes I offer here correspond roughly to the daily intake required to achieve cancer-preventive levels according to the innovative breast-surgery study I detailed in chapter 11. As you can see, horseradish has the smallest serving size, which means it’s the most concentrated of the cruciferous vegetables. One tablespoon and your Daily Dozen is down to an Everyday Eleven. Horseradish can be made into a sauce, relish, or dressing to score an extra check mark with a kick. It’s great in mashed potatoes or, for a healthier option still, mashed cauliflower. Just boil cauliflower for about ten minutes until tender and then mash with a fork or potato masher or purée in a food processor with some of the reserved cooking liquid until smooth. I season it with pepper, roasted garlic, and a dollop of horseradish and then pour mushroom gravy on it. Delicious!

Roasting Cruciferous Vegetables

As much as I love mashed cauliflower, roasted cauliflower (or broccoli, for that matter) is my favorite. Roasting brings out a nutty, caramelized flavor. I slice raw cauliflower into “steaks,” roast at 400°F for about a half hour, and then smother it in a lemon-tahini sauce. Sometimes I go minimalist and just sprinkle on lemon juice, zest, capers, and garlic. (This chapter is making me hungry!)

Kale Chips

I’ll talk about some of the more traditional ways I prepare greens in the next section, but kale chips deserve a special mention. You can use a dehydrator if you have one, but I often don’t have the patience. When I’m in the mood for kale chips, I want them now. They can be as simple as one ingredient: kale. Pull the leaves off the stems and tear into large pieces. Make sure that they are dry, or they’ll steam rather than crisp. Lay out the torn leaves in a single layer on a cookie tray lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat to prevent sticking, and bake at a low temperature (about 250°F) and check often to make sure they don’t burn. Within about twenty minutes, they transform into light, crispy snacks. Preseason the leaves before you roast them, or add your spices after they’re done. There are thousands of recipes online. I recommend starting with Ann Esselstyn’s recipe on her son Rip’s website, Engine2Diet.com.16 With kale chips, the more you snack, the healthier you are.

Cruciferous Garnishes

Similar to the way I use an open can of beans in the fridge as a reminder to try to bean-up any dish, we always have a purple (or red) cabbage in the crisper to help us cruciferize our meals. I slice off shreds and garnish nearly anything with them. Red cabbage averages about one dollar per pound,17 is found at pretty much any grocery store or market, can last weeks in the fridge (though if it does, that means you’re not using it enough!), and has more antioxidants per dollar than anything else you’ll find in the produce aisle. There are healthier foods you can buy, but not for the same amount of money. For example, purple cabbage may have nearly three times the antioxidant power per dollar that blueberries do.18 In terms of eating healthfully on a budget, purple cabbage can’t be beat. Or can it?

After chopping and discarding the waste, red cabbage averages 45 cents a cup.19 But broccoli sprouts—if you make them yourself—may be even cheaper. Broccoli sprout seeds can be purchased online or at natural foods stores for about twenty dollars a pound, but that makes about seventy-five cups of sprouts. In terms of sulforaphane content, that may be around three hundred cups of mature broccoli. So DIY broccoli sprouts provide a green-light sulforaphane source for about a nickel a day.

Sprouting broccoli sprouts is as easy as sprouting lentils. Start with a mason jar with a sprouting (screen) lid. Add a tablespoon of seeds, let them soak overnight in water, drain in the morning, and then after that, just quickly rinse and drain twice a day. Most people wait for about five days, until the seeds fully sprout (taking on the look of alfalfa sprouts), but new science suggests sulforaphane content peaks at forty-eight hours after the seeds are initially drained.20 This makes them even quicker and easier to grow and eat. When I’m not traveling, I usually have a few jars in rotation. It can be the middle of winter, and I’m growing my own salad on my kitchen counter! Every day, you can get cups of fresh produce for your family without ever having to go to the store.

Cruciferous Supplements?

If you don’t like the taste of cruciferous vegetables but still want the benefits of the sulforaphane, what about the broccoli supplements currently on the market? Researchers recently put a leading commercial supplement to the test. BroccoMax boasts the equivalent of a half pound of broccoli in every capsule. Study subjects were given either six capsules a day or a single cup of broccoli sprouts. The supplement hardly worked at all, whereas the sprouts boosted blood levels about eight times higher for eight times less cost. The researchers concluded that “our data provide further evidence that bioavailability of [sulforaphane] is dramatically lower when subjects consume broccoli supplements compared to fresh broccoli sprouts.”21

Too Much of a Good Thing?

If broccoli sprouts are so cheap and effective, why not eat bowls of them? A formal safety analysis found no significant adverse effects to about one and a half cups a day,22 but we didn’t have data on a potential upper limit until a team of Italian researchers tried to push the envelope. They were attempting to come up with an intravenous infusion dose to use as chemotherapy, and so they wanted to know how high they could go. The researchers discovered that blood levels achieved by four or more cups of broccoli sprouts may indeed be detrimental.23 They concluded, however, that no harm was found at “nutritionally attainable concentrations.” But that’s not really true. Broccoli sprouts do have a radishy bite, but someone could theoretically eat four cups of sprouts a day. (They don’t know health nuts like I know some health nuts.)

Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, someone came up to me after a lecture in Miami and told me he had heard that wheatgrass juice was good for you. “It cleans you out,” he had read. So he thought, Why not? and decided to stuff himself with it. He told me how he calculated the volume of the human digestive tract (all ten yards or so) and proceeded to drink that amount continuously, quart after quart, until it started coming out the other end. Intrigued, I asked him what happened. He looked up at me with an expression that I can only describe as rapturous and said, “It was volcanic.”

It would be hard for me to say too many good things about crucifers. These vegetables do wonders for your health, from fighting cancer progression and boosting defenses against pathogens and pollutants to helping protect your brain and vision and more. And you can use this family of veggies as your excuse to play Mad Scientist in the kitchen, manipulating enzyme chemistry to maximize the health benefits.

Greens

Dr. Greger’s Favorite Greens

Arugula, beet greens, collard greens, kale (black, green, and red), mesclun mix (assorted young salad greens), mustard greens, sorrel, spinach, swiss chard, and turnip greens

Serving Sizes:

1 cup raw

½ cup cooked

Daily Recommendation:

2 servings per day

Popeye was right when he bragged that he was strong to the finish because he ate his spinach. Dark-green, leafy vegetables are the healthiest foods on the planet. As whole foods go, they offer the most nutrition per calorie. Just to emphasize the point, there was a study published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer entitled “Antioxidant, Antimutagenic, and Antitumor Effects of Pine Needles.”1 Edible leaves, in all their shapes and sizes, it seems, can be healthy foods.

In 1777, General George Washington issued a general order that American troops should forage for wild greens growing around their camps “as these vegetables are very conducive to health, and tend to prevent … all putrid disorders.”2 Since then, however, Americans have declared their independence from greens. Today, only about one in twenty-five even reach a dozen servings throughout the course of an entire month.3 I advise getting more than a dozen servings per week.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT: Greens and Warfarin

In 1984, the tragic case of a thirty-five-year-old woman unfolded when she failed to inform her physician about her change in diet. Because of her mechanical heart valve, the woman was on a blood-thinning drug called warfarin. But because she wanted to lose weight, she started eating a diet composed almost entirely of salad, broccoli, turnip greens, and mustard greens. Five weeks later, she suffered a blood clot and died.4

If you are on the drug warfarin (also known as Coumadin), talk with your physician before you increase your greens intake. The drug works (both as a rat poison and a human blood-thinner) by crippling the enzyme that recycles vitamin K, which is involved in clotting your blood. If your system gets an influx of fresh vitamin K, which is concentrated in greens, you can thereby undermine the effectiveness of the drug. You should still be able to eat your greens, but your physician will have to titrate the dose of the drug to match your regular greens intake.

Eating greens nearly every day may be one of the most powerful steps you can take to prolong your life.5 Of all the food groups analyzed by a team of Harvard University researchers, greens turned out to be associated with the strongest protection against major chronic diseases,6 including up to about a 20 percent reduction in risk for both heart attacks7 and strokes8 for every additional daily serving.

Imagine if there were a pill that could prolong your life and only had good side effects. Everyone would be taking it! It would be making billions of dollars for the lucky drug company that created it. All health plans by law would have to cover it. People from every walk of life and every corner of the globe would be clamoring for it. But when that “pill” is just eat-your-greens, people lose interest.

Drug companies have yet to patent broccoli (though Monsanto is trying!9). Doctors, however, don’t have to wait for perky pharmaceutical sales reps to wine, dine, and cajole them into prescribing Pfizer-brand spinach or GlaxoSmithKline-brand collards. Here’s my prescription for you:



If the full spectrum of colorful plant pigments are good for you, why are greens the healthiest? When autumn in New England becomes aflame with brilliant hues, where do those oranges and yellows come from? They were there all along, actually—just masked by the green pigment chlorophyll that starts to break down in the fall.10 Similarly, the dark-green leaves of vegetables contain many of the other plant pigments all wrapped up in one package. As I mentioned, these colorful compounds are often the very same antioxidants implicated in many of the benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption. So, in essence, when you eat your greens, you are eating the rainbow.

How to Regenerate Coenzyme Q10 Naturally

One of the reasons greens are some of the healthiest green-light foods may be due to their green color. Decades ago, a search began for “interceptor” molecules that could serve as the body’s first line of defense against cancer. The theory was that if we could find something that could tightly bind to carcinogens and prevent them from slipping into our DNA, we might be able to prevent some of the mutations that lead to cancer. After years of combing for the existence of such carcinogen-binding molecules, an interceptor was found: chlorophyll, the most ubiquitous plant pigment in the world. It was right under our noses all along (provided we were eating healthfully!).11

In a petri dish, certain DNA damage in human cells exposed to a carcinogen could be “totally abolished” by chlorophyll.12 But what about in people? In the name of science, volunteers drank a solution of radioactive aflatoxin (a carcinogen) with or without spinach chlorophyll. Six cups of spinach worth of chlorophyll appeared to block about 40 percent of the carcinogen.13 Amazing! But that’s not all chlorophyll can do.

In college, you learn that pretty much everything you were taught in high school biology wasn’t true. Then in graduate school, you unlearn all the oversimplifications you learned in college. Just when you think you understand something in biology, it always seems a little more complicated than you thought. For example, until recently, we assumed plants and plantlike organisms were the only ones that could directly capture and utilize the energy from the sun. Plants photosynthesize. Animals don’t. That’s because plants have chlorophyll and animals do not. Well, technically, you do have chlorophyll in your body—temporarily, at least—after you eat greens. But it would seem there’s no way the chlorophyll that enters your bloodstream after that salad could react with sunlight. After all, light can’t penetrate through your skin, right?

Wrong. Any kid who’s ever shined a flashlight through her or his fingers could have told you that.

The red wavelengths of sunlight do penetrate into your body.14 In fact, if you step outside on a sunny day, there’s enough light reaching your brain that you could actually read this page inside your skull.15 Your internal organs are bathed in sunlight, along with any chlorophyll circulating in your bloodstream. Although any energy produced by the chlorophyll would be negligible,16 it turns out that light-activated chlorophyll in your body may help regenerate a critical molecule called coenzyme Q10.17

CoQ10, also known as ubiquinol, is an antioxidant. When ubiquinol extinguishes a free radical, it is oxidized to ubiquinone. To act as an effective antioxidant again, the body must regenerate ubiquinol from ubiquinone. Think of it like an electrical fuse: Ubiquinol can only be used once before having to be reset. That’s where sunlight and chlorophyll may come in.

Researchers exposed some ubiquinone and dietary chlorophyll metabolites to the kind of light that reaches your bloodstream … and poof! CoQ10 was reborn. However, without the chlorophyll, or without the light, nothing happened. All along, we’ve been thinking that the main benefit of sunlight was only the formation of vitamin D and that the main benefit of greens was the antioxidants they contain. But now we suspect the combination of the two may actually help the body create and maintain its own internal stock of antioxidants.

Eating a plant-based, chlorophyll-rich diet may be especially important for those on cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, as these medications can interfere with CoQ10 production.

Green Can Taste Great

I hope I’ve been able to convince you to eat greens as often as possible. The problem for many people is getting them to taste good. I’m afraid too many of us still suffer flashbacks from overcooked, slimy green lumps on school cafeteria trays.

Take kale, for example. Fibrous and grassy tasting, right? Kind of bitter too? Some varieties are more palatable than others. In a good supermarket produce section, you may be able to find three types: green, black, and red. Nutritionally, the differences among them appear to be insignificant compared to how much of each you may be willing to eat.18,19 The healthiest kale is the one you’ll eat the most of.

I would suggest using black kale (also called lacinato, dinosaur, or Tuscan kale), red kale (also found as red Russian kale), or baby kale, since these varieties are all milder and more tender than the more common mature green (curly) kale.

Start by rinsing the leaves thoroughly under running water. Then rip off the stems and tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces. Alternatively, after the leaves are removed from their stems, roll them up and slice into thin ribbons. If you want to make it even easier on yourself, just use whatever type you can find frozen. Frozen greens are cheaper, last longer, and come prewashed and prechopped.

There’s a phenomenon called flavor-flavor conditioning in which you can change your palate by linking a less pleasant flavor (for instance, sour or bitter) with a more pleasant one (say, sweet). For example, when researchers tried adding sugar to sour grapefruit juice, people liked it better. No surprise. But within a few days, the study subjects began to like even unsweetened grapefruit juice more than they did before the experiment started. In fact, this reconditioning of the palate lasted for at least weeks after the sugar was removed.20

The same happens when researchers dip or spritz broccoli with sugar water or aspartame.21 I know that sounds gross, but they’re not actually making the broccoli taste sweet. The added sweetness merely masks the bitterness by fooling your taste buds.22 This is why the so-called secret ingredient in many collard greens recipes is a spoonful of sugar. Certainly, if there were ever a food to justify the use of a yellow- or red-light condiment to boost consumption, it would be the single healthiest of all foods: greens. I use a balsamic glaze even though it has some added sugar in it. It would be healthier, though, to add green-light sweetness in the form of something like figs or grated apples.

The sweetness trick is why green smoothies can be so delicious (if not a little odd looking). Smoothies can be a great way to introduce greens into children’s diets. The basic triad is a liquid, ripe fruit, and fresh greens. I’d start with a two-to-one ratio of fruits to greens to start with before tipping heavier toward greens on the scale. So, for example, one cup of water, a frozen banana, a cup of frozen berries, and a cup of packed baby spinach would be a classic green smoothie 101.

I like to add fresh mint leaves as well for a boost of flavor (and even more greens). Fresh herbs can be expensive at the store, but mint can grow like a weed in your yard or in a pot on your windowsill. Eating greens for breakfast can be as delicious as mint chocolate oatmeal—cooked oatmeal, chopped mint leaves, cocoa powder, and a healthy sweetener (see here).

When you’re thinking about ways to pair your greens with something you already love to make the greens more palatable, consider mixing them with a green-light source of fat: nuts, seeds, nut or seed butters, or avocados. Many of the nutrients greens are famous for are fat soluble, including beta-carotene, lutein, vitamin K, and zeaxanthin. So pairing your greens with a green-light source of fat may not only make them taste better but will maximize nutrient absorption. This can mean enjoying a creamy tahini-based dressing on your salad, putting walnuts in your pesto, or sprinkling some toasted sesame seeds on your sautéed kale.

The jump in nutrient absorption is no small effect. When researchers tried feeding people a healthy salad of spinach, romaine, carrots, and tomatoes along with a source of fat, there was an impressive spike in carotenoid phytonutrients in their bloodstream over the next eight hours. With a fat-free dressing, carotenoid absorption flatlined down to negligible amounts; it was as if they’d never eaten the salad at all.23 Similarly, adding some avocado to your salsa may triple the amount of fat-soluble nutrients that make it into your bloodstream (in this case, the lycopene in the tomatoes).24 It doesn’t take much. Just three grams of fat in an entire hot meal may be sufficient to boost absorption.25 That’s just a single walnut or a spoonful of avocado or shredded coconut. Snack on a few pistachios after a meal, and you’re all set. The greens and the source of fat just have to end up in your stomach at the same time.

Another way to remove bitterness from greens is to blanch or boil them, but unfortunately this works by leaching some of the healthy compounds into the cooking water.26 If you’re making soup, that’s not a problem, because the nutrients aren’t destroyed as much as they are displaced. If the cooking liquid is poured off, however, you could be losing some nutrition. But even if 50 percent of these healthy compounds go down the drain, if the decreased bitterness motivates you to eat twice as many greens, problem solved! Whenever I’m boiling pasta, for example, I’ll add a bunch of fresh greens to the pot a few minutes before I’m ready to drain the pasta. I know I’ll be losing some nutrients when I pour off the cooking water, but it’s worth it to me for the convenience of throwing everything into one pot and getting my family to eat even more greens.

Try to incorporate greens into as many meals as possible. I put just about everything I eat on a bed of greens. That way, the greens take on the flavor of the rest of the dish. However, if you want to eat cooked greens “straight,” you can try adding lemon juice, flavored vinegars, red pepper flakes, garlic, ginger, low-sodium soy sauce, or caramelized onions. I personally like mine hot, sweet, smoky, and salty. I use hot sauce for heat, balsamic glaze for sweetness, and both smoked paprika and liquid smoke. For saltiness, I used to be fond of a soy sauce substitute called Bragg Liquid Aminos until I got more serious about cutting down my sodium intake. The best sodium-free salt substitute I’ve been able to find is something called Table Tasty. (What’s with these names?)

There are whole grocery aisles full of prepared sauces with which you can experiment. Most have added salt, oil, or sugar, so I try to reserve them for exceptionally healthy foods. Mixing yellow- and red-light foods together (like dipping your fries and McNuggets in barbecue sauce) may just add insult to injury, but I wouldn’t eat half as many baked rosemary sweet-potato fries if I weren’t dipping them in hot-sauce-spiked ketchup. And if there were ever an excuse to dip out of the green-light zone, it would be for green, leafy vegetables.

During my bachelor days, I would regularly order Chinese food for delivery—usually broccoli and garlic sauce (hold the white rice). Then I’d throw brown rice or quinoa along with dried lentils into my rice cooker and steam or microwave a pound of greens. By the time the delivery arrived, everything was ready and I would just mix it all together and have more than enough for leftovers.

You can also find prepackaged pouches of Indian food online or at Indian or natural foods markets. Again, I’d use them as sauces rather than eat them as a meal in themselves. My favorite is spinach dal—that way, I’m eating greens in a greens sauce! That’s like the kale-pesto principle: Use one green (basil) to make the other green (kale) taste better.

The Health Benefits of Vinegar

Vinegar may be one condiment that’s good for you. Randomized, controlled trials involving both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals suggest that adding two teaspoons of vinegar to a meal may improve blood sugar control, effectively blunting the blood sugar spike after a meal by about 20 percent.27 So adding vinegar to potato salad or to rice (like the Japanese do to make sushi rice) or dipping bread in balsamic vinegar may blunt the effects of these high-glycemic foods.

We’ve known about the antiglycemic effect of vinegar for more than twenty-five years, but we’re still not sure of the mechanism.28 Originally, it was thought that vinegar slowed stomach emptying, but even consuming vinegar outside of meals appears to help. Type 2 diabetics consuming two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar at bedtime, for example, were found to wake up with better blood sugars in the morning.29 Consuming pickles or vinegar pills does not seem to have the same effect.30 Do not, however, drink vinegar straight, as it can burn your esophagus,31 or in excess—a cup a day for six years (that’s two thousand cups!) was discovered to be a bad idea.32

Vinegar may also help with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), improve arterial function, and help reduce body fat. A daily tablespoon of apple cider vinegar restored ovarian function within a few months in four out of seven women with PCOS.33 A tablespoon of rice vinegar was found to acutely improve artery function in postmenopausal women. We’re not sure why, but the acetate from the acetic acid in vinegar may lead to improved nitric-oxide production (see here).34 Such an effect would be expected to help with hypertension, and indeed there is a study purporting to show blood pressure benefits from a tablespoon of vinegar a day.35

Despite folk wisdom to the contrary, vinegar does not appear to be an effective treatment for head lice,36 but it may help with weight loss. A double-blind, placebo-controlled (but vinegar company–funded) study was performed, in which obese subjects consumed daily vinegar drinks with either one or two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, or a placebo drink that tasted like vinegar but contained no acetic acid. Both vinegar groups lost significantly more weight than the control group. Though the effect was modest—about four pounds over a three-month period—CT scans showed the vinegar groups’ subjects lost a significant amount of their “visceral” fat, the abdominal fat that is particularly associated with chronic disease risk.37

There are all sorts of flavorful, exotic vinegars to explore these days, including fig, peach, and pomegranate. I encourage you to experiment and find ways to incorporate some into your diet.

Salad Days

Having a big salad every day is a great way to burn through the Daily Dozen. To a base of mesclun greens and arugula, I add tomato, red bell pepper, beans, and barberries, along with toasted nuts if I’m using a fat-free dressing. My current favorite dressing recipe is a Caesar spin-off shared by Dr. Michael Klaper from the TrueNorth Health Center:

2 tablespoons almond meal

3 cloves crushed garlic

3 tablespoons dijon mustard

3 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes

2 tablespoons white miso

3 tablespoons lemon juice

1/3 cup water

Blend and enjoy! (If you have a high-speed blender, you could probably use whole almonds instead of meal.)

Baby spinach may have higher levels of phytonutrients than mature spinach leaves,38 but what about real baby spinach—so-called microgreens, the seedlings of vegetables and herbs? A nutritional analysis of twenty-five commercially available microgreens found they did have significantly higher nutrient densities. For example, red cabbage microgreens have a sixfold higher vitamin C concentration than mature red cabbage and nearly seventy times the vitamin K.39 But they’re eaten in such microquantities that even the healthiest upscale restaurant garnish probably isn’t going to do much for you.

If, however, you want to grow your own, you could have rotating trays of microgreens that you snip off with scissors for probably the healthiest salad out there. (On a lecture tour, I once stayed with someone who did just that, and I’ve been jealous ever since.) Microgreens are the perfect plants for the impatient gardener—fully grown in just one to two weeks.

The One Green to Avoid

Although greens are the healthiest of foods, there’s one green I caution against eating: alfalfa sprouts. Over a dozen years, twenty-eight outbreaks of Salmonella food poisoning linked to sprouts have been documented in the United States, affecting 1,275 people.40 Of course, Salmonella-tainted eggs sicken an estimated 142,000 Americans every year,41 but that doesn’t make it any less tragic for those hospitalized and killed in “sproutbreaks.” Alfalfa sprout seeds have all sorts of microscopic nooks and crannies where bacteria from manure-contaminated irrigation water can hide. So even home-sprouted alfalfa seeds should not be considered safe.

I will never forget a presentation I gave in Boston. It was in a game show–style format in which contestants from the audience tried to rank, from healthiest to unhealthiest, the foods I’d brought with me. There was a lively cacophony of conflicting advice shouted from the crowd. You can imagine the groans when I revealed that alfalfa sprouts—a quintessential health food—belonged way at the top on the foods-to-avoid list.

Later that night, I was stuck with the sprouts after all the healthier and yummier items had been given away as prizes. I had just told my audience not to eat them—but I hate wasting food. In a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do moment, I added them to my salad that night. Yes, they had been sitting in the car all day and on stage for hours. Yes, they were at the top of my game show’s list of foods you should not eat. But, what were the odds that that one particular package was contaminated? I went back to work the next day at the New England Medical Center emergency room—not as a physician but as a patient with Salmonella food poisoning.

So other than the dreaded alfalfa sprout, greens truly are the healthiest foods on the planet. You simply can’t do better in terms of nutrition per calorie. Explore, innovate, taste test, play, and teach your palate to enjoy them. Whether you sneak them into a refreshing smoothie, incorporate them into sauces and dressings, use them as a base for main dishes, or eat them straight in a big, vibrant salad—just do it. Your body will thank you with every bite of greens you take.

Other Vegetables

Dr. Greger’s Other Favorite Vegetables

Artichokes, asparagus, beets, bell peppers, carrots, corn, garlic, mushrooms (button, oyster, portobello, and shiitake), okra, onions, purple potatoes, pumpkin, sea vegetables (arame, dulse, and nori), snap peas, squash (delicata, summer, and spaghetti squash varieties), sweet potatoes/yams, tomatoes, and zucchini

Serving Sizes:

1 cup raw leafy vegetables

½ cup raw or cooked nonleafy vegetables

½ cup vegetable juice

¼ cup dried mushrooms

Daily Recommendation:

2 servings per day

The mammoth Global Burden of Disease Study identified the typical American diet as the primary cause of Americans’ death and disability1 and inadequate vegetable intake as our fifth-leading dietary risk factor, nearly as bad as our consumption of processed meat.2 The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that if the nation increased its consumption of fruits and veggies to meet the dietary guidelines, we might save the lives of more than one hundred thousand people a year.3

You should eat more fruits and vegetables as if your life depended on it, because maybe it does.

Garden Variety: Diversifying Your Vegetable Portfolio

Perhaps the least controversial advice in all of nutrition is to eat more fruits and vegetables, which is to say eat more plants, since the term vegetable basically just means all parts of the plant that aren’t fruit. There are root vegetables like sweet potatoes, stem vegetables like rhubarb, pod vegetables like peas, and even flower vegetables like broccoli. (It isn’t called cauliflower for nothing.) We’ve already talked about the leaf vegetables in the greens section. If dark-green, leafy vegetables are the healthiest foods around, then why branch out to other parts of the plant? (Pun intended!) Yes, you’re supposed to eat the rainbow, but didn’t we just learn that green leaves have an entire spectrum of colors hidden inside?

Unlike more generic compounds like vitamin C, which is broadly available in various fruits and vegetables, other nutrients are not so evenly distributed. Just as certain fruits like citrus offer unique nonpigment phytonutrients not found in other fruits, different vegetables contribute different compounds. White cauliflower, lacking antioxidant pigments, doesn’t appear to have much to offer at first glance, but because it belongs to the cruciferous family, it’s one of your healthiest options. Similarly, white mushrooms may look pretty drab, but they can provide myconutrients not found in the entire plant kingdom.

We now know that certain phytonutrients bind to specific receptors and other proteins in the body. I talked about the Ah “broccoli receptors” in chapter 5. There are also effectively green-tea receptors in your body—that is, receptors for EGCG, a key component of green tea. There are binding proteins for the phytonutrients in grapes, onions, and capers. Recently, a cell surface receptor was even identified for a nutrient concentrated in apple peels. These specific proteins may not be activated, though, unless you eat specific foods.4

The different phytonutrient profiles may then result in different clinical effects. For example, drinking tomato juice can rescue the immune function of study subjects crippled by two weeks of fruit and vegetable deficiency, but carrot juice apparently cannot.5 Even different parts of the same vegetable can have different effects. One of the reasons certain tomato products appear to be protective against heart attacks6 is because the yellow fluid surrounding the seeds concentrates a compound that suppresses platelet activation.7 (Platelets are what help trigger the blood clots that cause heart attacks and most strokes.) Aspirin has a similar effect, but it doesn’t work in everyone and can increase bleeding risk—two limitations that the tomato compound may be able to overcome.8,9 But if you only consume tomato sauce, juice, or ketchup, you may be missing out10 since the seeds are removed during processing. So when picking out canned tomato products, choose whole, crushed, or diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, purée, or paste.


******************************************************************************************8
Different plants may also affect the same part of the body in different ways. Consider mental function, for instance. In a study of dozens of fruits and vegetables, from raspberries to rutabagas, certain plants appear to shore up specific cognitive domains. For example, the consumption of some plant foods was associated with better executive function, perceptual speed, and semantic (fact-based) memory, while the consumption of others was more consistently associated with visual-spatial skills and autobiographical memory.11 In other words, you may need to build up a portfolio of many fruits and vegetables to cover all your bases.

One of the reasons studies may underestimate the protective effects of plant foods is that they tend to measure quantity of fruit and vegetable consumption rather than quality of fruit and vegetable consumption. People are more likely to eat bananas and cucumbers than blueberries and kale. But variety is important too. Half the fruit servings in the United States are taken up by just five fruits—apples and apple juice, bananas, grapes, orange juice, and watermelon—and most vegetable servings are from canned tomatoes, potatoes, and iceberg lettuce.12

In one of the few studies that looked specifically at the diversity of fruit and vegetable consumption, the variety of intake was an even better predictor of decreased inflammation in the bodies of middle-aged adults than the absolute quantity of consumption.13 Even after removing the effects of quantity, the addition of two different types of fruits and vegetables per week has been associated with an 8 percent reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes.14 These kinds of data led the American Heart Association to add a recommendation in their latest dietary guidelines to also eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.15 It’s an important addition; otherwise, a big bag of potato chips or one head of iceberg lettuce could technically fulfill or exceed your recommended nine servings a day.

It’s better to eat a whole orange rather than take a vitamin C pill, since the pill deprives you of all the other wonderful nutrients in the oranges themselves. The same principle applies when you don’t diversify your fruit and vegetable consumption. By only eating apples, you also miss out on oranges’ nutrients. You don’t get the limonoids in citrus, like limonin, limonol, or tangeretin, though you may get more malic acid (from the Latin malum, meaning apple). When it comes to the unique phytonutrient profile of each fruit and vegetable, it’s like comparing apples to oranges! That’s why you should mix it up.

In a sense, though, all fruits are just fruits, whereas vegetables can be any other part of the plant. Roots may harbor different nutrients than shoots. For this reason, it may be even more important to get in a variety of vegetables, so you can benefit from all parts of the plant, as one large cancer study of nearly a half-million people did indeed find.16 “Because each vegetable contains a unique combination,” a recent review concluded, “a great diversity of vegetables should be eaten … to get all the health benefits.”17 Variety is not only the spice of life; it may prolong it as well.

How to Make a Cancer-Fighting Salad

Imagine you’re standing in line at one of those made-to-order salad places where you get to choose your lettuce, your toppings, and your dressing. You start with the greens. For the sake of this example, let’s say you are offered a choice between the five covered in the Food Chemistry study: Boston lettuce, endive, radicchio, romaine lettuce, and spinach. Which should you choose? Based on the study findings: spinach. Out of the five options, spinach beat out the others against breast cancer, brain tumors, kidney cancer, lung cancer, pediatric brain tumors, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer. The runner up? Radicchio.61

Which toppings should you add to your spinach salad? You only get five to choose from and, after consulting the Daily Dozen cheat sheet in your wallet, you can tick three check boxes immediately: beans, berries, and nuts. Now you only have two toppings left. Out of the thirty-two remaining vegetables included in the study, which two of the following should you pick? Choose carefully:

Acorn squash

Asparagus

Beetroot

Bok choy

Boston lettuce

Broccoli

Brussels sprouts

Cabbage

Carrot

Cauliflower

Celery

Curly cabbage

Eggplant

Endive

English cucumber

Fennel bulb

Fiddleheads

Garlic

Green beans

Green onions

Jalapeño

Kale

Leek

Orange bell pepper

Potato

Radicchio

Radish

Red cabbage

Romaine lettuce

Rutabaga

Tomato

Yellow onion

Which two did you choose? If one of your choices was brussels sprouts, cabbage, curly cabbage, or kale, and the other choice was garlic, green onions, or leek, you get a gold star! Of all the vegetables tested, those had the most cancer-preventing potential. Notice anything they have in common? All the top choices belong to one of only two superfood families: cruciferous vegetables and the allium veggie family, which includes garlic and onions. As the researchers put it, “the inclusion of cruciferous and Allium vegetables in the diet is essential for effective dietary-based chemopreventive [cancer-preventing] strategies.”62

Note that the most common vegetables didn’t make the cut. “The majority of the vegetable extracts tested in this study, including vegetables that are commonly consumed in Western countries such as potato, carrot, lettuce and tomato,” the researchers concluded, “had little effect on the proliferation of the tumour cell lines.”63

The single most effective vegetable was garlic, which came in first against breast cancer, both child and adult brain cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer, and second after leeks against kidney cancer. So might I suggest a garlicky salad dressing like the one here?


//
Garlic and Onions

As the above salad example illustrates, garlic, onions, leeks, and other vegetables in the allium family appear to have special properties. Wait a second, though. Like chemotherapy, maybe garlic isn’t just toxic to cancer cells but toxic to all cells? That wouldn’t be good. Researchers also wondered about this, so they decided to compare the effects of garlic and other vegetables on the growth of both cancer cells and normal cells. The same garlic dose that blocked nearly 80 percent of cancer cell proliferation appeared to have no effect whatsoever against normal cells, and similar results were found for the other allium and cruciferous vegetables. In other words, vegetables are selective; they destroy cancer cells but leave normal cells alone.

These results were seen in a petri dish, though, and while such studies may have direct relevance for digestive-tract cancers that come in close contact with these foods, for these foods to be protective against other cancers, the anticancer compounds would have to be absorbed into the bloodstream. And in the case of brain tumors, the anticancer compounds would additionally have to cross the blood-brain barrier. The findings do seem to sync with other studies, though, both among human populations and in other laboratories, that corroborate the cancer-fighting benefits of cruciferous vegetables,64 garlic, and onions.65 Regardless, this study illustrates the dramatic differences between the biological capacities of individual vegetables and families of veggies and underscores the importance of including a variety of vegetables in your diet.

Which Is the Best Cooking Method?

Is it better to eat your vegetables raw or cooked? If you’re thinking raw, you’re right. But if you guessed cooked, you’re also right.66 Confused? Well, a number of nutrients, like vitamin C, are partially destroyed by cooking. For example, steamed broccoli may have about 10 percent less vitamin C than raw broccoli.67 If, however, you prefer cooked broccoli enough to eat seven florets of steamed rather than six florets of raw, then you just more than made up the difference.

Other nutrients, however, actually become more absorbable after cooking. For example, you end up with more than six times the vitamin A in your bloodstream from cooked carrots compared to raw ones.68 A study of long-term raw foodists found surprisingly low blood levels of the red antioxidant pigment lycopene.69 It’s not what you eat but what you absorb, and cooked tomatoes appear able to better boost your lycopene levels.70 Steaming may also improve the bile acid–binding capacity of vegetables,71 which may help lower breast cancer risk.72

Raw-food diets automatically eliminate most red- and yellow-light foods, which is not only an improvement over the standard American diet but also over many plant-based diets. There is no evidence to suggest, however, that eating raw foods largely or exclusively is healthier than eating a combination of cooked and raw whole plant foods.

Some cooking methods, though, are preferable to others. Deep-fried foods, whether of plant origin (like french fries) or from animals (like fried chicken), have been associated with higher cancer risk.73 Deep-frying leads to the production of dangerous heterocyclic amines in meat (as detailed in chapter 11) and to acrylamide in deep-fried plant foods. The excess lifetime cancer risk attributable to the consumption of french fries in young children, for example, may be as high as one or two in ten thousand—meaning about one in ten thousand boys and girls eating french fries may develop cancer that would have otherwise not occurred had they not eaten french fries. The researchers urge deep-fryer cooking times and temperatures be set as low as possible “while still maintaining a tasty quality.”74 (They wouldn’t want to reduce cancer so much that the deep-fried foods wouldn’t be as tasty!) Blanching potatoes first can reduce acrylamide formation, but potato chip companies argue that this might have a negative impact on the “nutritional properties of the fried product,” because it would leach away some of the vitamin C.75 But if you’re relying on potato chips to get your vitamin C, acrylamide is probably the least of your worries.

************************************************
What is the best way to cook vegetables to preserve nutrition? I am often asked that question, and it’s difficult to answer, as it varies for different vegetables. What we would need is a study that measures a variety of different cooking methods with a variety of different vegetables. Thankfully, we got exactly that in 2009. A Spanish research team pulled out all the stops, performing more than three hundred separate experiments with twenty vegetables and six cooking methods, all while considering three different measures of antioxidant activity. They tested baking, boiling, frying, griddling (cooking in a thick frying pan with no oil), microwaving, and pressure-cooking.76

Let’s start with the worst methods in terms of antioxidant loss: boiling and pressure-cooking. When you use these wet-cooking methods, some of the nutrition is lost into the cooking water, but less than I would have thought. For instance, the researchers found that boiling removes an average of 14 percent of the vegetables’ antioxidant capacity. So, if you like your corn on the cob boiled, you could just add an extra quarter ear to the pot. (Six quarters boiled may have all the antioxidant power of five quarters raw, baked, or microwaved.77) Of the six cooking methods studied, griddling and microwaving were actually the gentlest. Nuking your veggies appears to preserve, on average, more than 95 percent of antioxidant capacity.78

Those are averages across twenty vegetables, however. Some vegetables are more resistant, and antioxidant power actually increases with cooking in some veggies. Which do you think was the most vulnerable vegetable—that is, the one probably best eaten raw? If you guessed bell peppers, you’re right. They’ve been shown to lose up to 70 percent of their antioxidant capacity when baked in an oven. I’m going to continue to roast my peppers because of how much I love the taste, but I realize I’m getting less nutritional bang for my buck. (No biggie, though, because I can just add an extra sprinkle of oregano to my roasted red pepper pasta sauce.)

On the other hand, three vegetables hardly seem to be affected at all by cooking: artichokes, beets, and onions. You can even boil them, and they’ll still retain 97.5 percent of their antioxidant power.

Finally, there are two vegetables that may actually become healthier through cooking: the humble carrot and the celery stalk. No matter how you prepare them—even by boiling—carrots and celery appear to gain in antioxidant power. Green beans get an honorable mention, because they increase in antioxidant power when cooked by all methods except boiling or pressure-cooking. Microwaved green beans, for example, have more antioxidants than raw. So go ahead and make a nice vegetable soup and boost the ingredients’ antioxidant content at the same time.

How to Make Your Own Fruit and Vegetable Wash

Buying organic foods reduces your exposure to pesticides, but it doesn’t eliminate them entirely. Pesticide residues have been detected in 11 percent of organic crop samples due to accidental or fraudulent use, cross-contamination from neighboring nonorganic fields, or the lingering presence of persistent pollutants like DDT in the soil.79

There are many commercial fruit and vegetable wash products that purport to improve the removal of pesticides, but a variety have been tested and appear to be a complete waste of money.80 For example, Procter & Gamble had a product that claimed it was “proven to be 98% more effective than water in removing pesticides.” When it was put to the test, though, it did no better than plain tap water.81 Rinsing produce under running water generally removes less than half of the pesticide residue.82 A fingernail-polish-remover acetone bath has been found to be more effective at removing pesticides,83 but of course I’m not advocating dunking your fruits and veggies in that! The goal is to make your tomato less toxic.

One effective method is to use a 5 percent acetic-acid bath—in other words, plain white vinegar, which has been found to remove the bulk of certain pesticide residues.84 But 5 percent is full strength, and it would get expensive buying gallons of white vinegar just to wash your fruits and veggies. Unfortunately, a diluted white-vinegar bath only seems marginally more effective than tap water.85

Thankfully, there is a solution that is both cheap and effective: salt water. A 10 percent saltwater rinse has been found to work as well as full-strength vinegar.86 To make your own pesticide-reducing bath, add one part salt to nine parts water. Just make sure to rinse off all the salt before eating.


//***********************************
Is Buying Organic Worth It?

Stroll down the produce aisle of your grocery store. You’ll see lots of foods labeled “organic,” but what does that really mean?

According to the USDA, organic farming practices preserve the environment and avoid most synthetic materials, including pesticides and antibiotics. Among other requirements, organic farmers must receive annual on-site inspections, use only USDA-approved materials, and not use genetically modified crops. In order to be counted in the $35 billion U.S. organic retail market, products receive a USDA organic stamp.87

The fact is that being organic doesn’t mean a food is healthy. The organic food industry didn’t become so lucrative by selling carrots. For instance, you can now buy pesticide-free potato chips and organic jelly beans.88 There are even organic Oreo cookies. Junk food is still junk food, even if it was produced organically. The organic label cannot turn red lights green.

Many are surprised to learn (I know I was!) that a review of hundreds of studies found that organic produce does not seem to have significantly more vitamins and minerals. Organic fruits and vegetables do, however, appear to have more nontraditional nutrients like polyphenol antioxidants,89 thought to be because conventionally grown plants given high-dose synthetic nitrogen fertilizers may divert more resources to growth rather than defense.90 This may be why, as we learned in chapter 4, organic berries appear to suppress cancer growth better than conventional berries in vitro.

Based on its elevated antioxidant levels, organic produce may be considered 20–40 percent healthier, the equivalent of adding one or two servings’ worth to a five-a-day regimen. But organic produce may be 40 percent more expensive, so for the same money, you could just buy the extra servings’ worth of conventional produce. From a purely nutrients-per-dollar standpoint, it’s not clear that organic foods are any better.91 But people don’t just buy organic foods because they’re healthier—what about safety?

Conventional produce appears to have twice the levels of cadmium, one of the three toxic heavy metals in the food supply, along with mercury and lead.92 The cadmium is thought to come from the phosphate fertilizers that are added to conventional crops.93 The greatest concern most people have about conventionally grown produce, though, is the pesticide residues.

People not only tend to overestimate the nutritional benefit of organic food, they also overestimate the risks of pesticides.94 For example, surveys have found that many consumers erroneously believe that just as many people die from pesticide residues on conventional food as they do from automobile accidents,95 or that eating nonorganic produce is almost as bad as smoking a daily pack of cigarettes.96 This kind of thinking is dangerous, as it could lead to a decrease in overall fruit and vegetable consumption.

If just half of the U.S. population were to increase fruit and vegetable consumption by a single serving per day, an estimated twenty thousand cancer cases might be avoided each year. This estimate was calculated using conventional produce, so the additional pesticide burden from all that extra produce might be expected to cause ten new cancer cases. On balance, the study suggested, if half of Americans ate one more serving of produce per day, we’d prevent 19,990 people from becoming cancer patients every year. Sounds good to me!

Unfortunately, this paper was written by scientists-for-hire paid by conventional produce growers, so they had an incentive to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the risks.97 Nevertheless, I think the bottom line is sound. You receive tremendous benefit from eating conventional fruits and vegetables that far outweighs whatever little bump in risk you may get from the pesticides.98 But why accept any risk at all when you can choose organic? My own family buys organic whenever we can, but we never let concern about pesticides stop us from stuffing our faces with as many fruits and vegetables as possible.

*   *   *

At least half your plate should be filled with vegetables. Here’s a simple rule: Include vegetables in everything, and the more the better. Bean burritos are better than carnitas, but better still is a bean burrito with lots of veggies wrapped inside. Instead of spaghetti with marinara sauce, make it spaghetti with marinara sauce … and loads of veggies. Marinara is certainly better than Alfredo, but it’s even better still to go the extra veggie mile and heap on your favorite vegetables.

Flaxseeds

Dr. Greger’s Favorite Flaxseeds

Golden or brown

Serving Size:

1 tablespoon ground

Daily Recommendation:

1 serving per day

I have talked about the wonders of flaxseeds in a few of this book’s earlier chapters, including those on high blood pressure (chapter 7), breast cancer (chapter 11), and prostate cancer (chapter 13). Remember how flaxseeds apparently offer “miraculous defense against some critical maladies”?

Okay, you’re convinced. But just where do you get flaxseeds, and how do you best use them?

You can buy flaxseeds in bulk at natural foods stores for just a few dollars per pound. They come in nature’s finest packaging: a hard natural hull that keeps them fresh. However, Mother Nature packs them a little too well. If you eat flaxseeds whole, they’re likely to pass right through you without releasing any of their nutrients. So, for best results, first grind up the seeds with a blender or coffee or spice grinder, or buy them preground or “milled.” (The other option is to chew them really well.) Thanks to their antioxidant content, ground flaxseeds should last at least four months at room temperature.1

Ground flax is a light, nutty powder that can be sprinkled on oatmeal, salads, soups—frankly, just about anything you’re eating. You can even bake with flax without damaging the lignans2 or omega-3 fatty acids3 (unlike flaxseed oil). During medical school, I used to make a few dozen flaxseed muffins at a time and put them in the freezer. Then I’d pop one in the microwave every morning before I ran out the door and get my daily flax fix while eating breakfast surreptitiously on the subway.

Are Fruit-and-Nut Bars Fattening?

There are a number of energy bars on the market containing only green-light ingredients, such as dried fruits, seeds, and nuts. People love them because they’re so easy to throw into a briefcase, backpack, or purse and eat as a convenient snack on the go.

Dried fruits, seeds, and nuts are all nutrient-dense foods, but they’re also calorie dense. Might concentrating so many calories into such a small energy bar contribute to weight gain? To find out, Yale University researchers split about one hundred overweight men and women into two groups. All the participants ate their normal diet, but half were told to add two fruit-and-nut bars daily. After two months, despite the extra 340 calories a day from the bars, the fruit-and-nut bar group did not gain any weight.4

Dried fruits and nuts appear to be so satiating that people feel full and unintentionally offset the calories elsewhere throughout the day. Studies on apple rings,5 figs,6 prunes,7 and raisins8 have found similar results. In the apple study, postmenopausal women who added two apples’ worth of apple rings to their daily diet for six months not only didn’t gain weight but experienced a whopping 24 percent drop in their LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.9 (That’s nearly the effect you can get with some statin drugs!) In general, the 7 percent of Americans who average a tablespoon or more of dried fruit per day tend to be less overweight and less obese, and they have slimmer waistlines and less abdominal obesity than Americans who don’t eat as much dried fruit.10

Of course, when shopping for energy bars, it’s imperative that you read their labels, as many brands have added sugars. Or you can just save yourself some money and choose good old-fashioned trail mix. Better yet, how about eating a piece of fresh fruit? Still, if the choice is between an energy bar and a candy bar as an afternoon snack, the choice is clear.

Other Ways to Eat Flaxseeds

When you’re not sprinkling ground flax on your cereal, salads, or soups or baking it into your muffins, there are plenty of other ways to get your daily serving of flaxseeds. There are a lot of convenient flax bars, crackers, and snacks on the market these days, a few of which even have all green-light ingredients.

Honestly, it’s pretty easy to make your own flax crackers. Mix two cups of ground flaxseeds with a cup of water, add whatever herbs and spices you want, and then spread the dough thinly on a parchment- or silicone-lined baking sheet. Score the dough into thirty-two crackers and bake at 400°F for about twenty minutes. To flavor mine, I use a half teaspoon each of smoked paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder, but you should play around until you find a (salt-free) spice profile you prefer. When cut into thirty-two pieces, each cracker meets your Daily Dozen serving requirement.

I also use my trusty discount dehydrator to make raw flax crackers. All you do is mix a cup of whole flaxseeds with a cup of water along with flavorful ingredients like sun-dried tomatoes and basil. After it firms for about an hour and gets a jelly-like consistency, I spread it out thinly and dehydrate away. Give it a try! Dip your flax crackers in hummus or another bean dip for double check marks. Since you’re using whole flaxseeds, though, make sure to chew thoroughly for maximum benefit.

Flaxseeds have a wonderful binding quality that makes them a great ingredient for thick, milkshake-like smoothies. Toss a tablespoon of ground flax into a blender with some frozen berries, unsweetened soy milk, and half a ripe banana or mango or a few dates for sweetness, and you have a delicious drink containing both classes of protective phytoestrogens—lignans in flax and isoflavones in soy. (See chapter 11.) Blend in some cocoa powder for a chocolate milkshake that could help improve your chances of both preventing and surviving breast and prostate cancers.

This same binding quality makes flaxseeds a green-light thickener to replace cornstarch. I use flax to make my favorite quickie stir-fry sauce. I start with some bok choy and fresh mushrooms. The water clinging to the bok choy after it’s rinsed, along with the liquid that gets released from the mushrooms while cooking, is enough to flash-steam the veggies in a hot pan without any added oil. Once the bok choy is tender-crisp, I add a cup of water mixed with a tablespoon each of tahini, ground flaxseeds, and Asian black-bean garlic sauce, a fermented yellow-light condiment you can find in a jar at most large grocery stores. Once the sauce thickens, it’s ready for some fresh ground pepper (and hot sauce, if you’ve got that spicy tooth like I do) and … voilà!

You can even use ground flaxseeds to replace eggs in baking. For each egg in the recipe, whisk one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds with three tablespoons of water until the mixture becomes gooey. Unlike chicken eggs, “flax eggs” are not only cholesterol-free but they’re also packed with soluble fiber to bring your cholesterol down11 instead of up.

It never ceases to amaze me how these tiny little seeds can pack such a health-promoting punch. With just a measly tablespoon a day and so many delicious, easy ways to incorporate ground flax into your sips and bites, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to tick this Daily Dozen check box every day.

Nuts and Seeds

Dr. Greger’s Favorite Nuts and Seeds

Almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, chia seeds, hazelnuts/filberts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and walnuts

Serving Sizes:

¼ cup nuts or seeds

2 tablespoons nut or seed butter

Daily Recommendation:

1 serving per day

Sometimes it feels like there just aren’t enough hours in a day to get everything done. So instead of trying to make your day longer, why not make your life longer by an extra two years? That’s about how long your life span may be increased by eating nuts regularly—one handful (or about a quarter of a cup) five or more days a week.1 Just that one simple and delicious act alone may extend your life.

The Global Burden of Disease Study calculated that not eating enough nuts and seeds was the third-leading dietary risk factor for death and disability in the world, killing more people than processed meat consumption. Insufficient nut and seed intake is thought to lead to the deaths of millions of people every year, fifteen times more than all those who die from overdoses of heroin, crack cocaine, and all other illicit drugs combined.2

The Uses of Blended Nuts

Nuts make for quick and delicious snacks on their own, but my personal favorite use for them is as green-light sources of fat to make rich, creamy sauces. Whether in a cashew Alfredo, a ginger-peanut sauce, or a tahini-based green goddess dressing, nuts and seeds can maximize nutrient acquisition by both improving absorption and increasing your total intake of vegetables by adding some creamy cachet.

An often overlooked use for nuts is as a key ingredient in soups, such as African peanut stew. When blended and heated, cashews thicken to make an amazingly creamy soup base. Nut and seed butters also pair well with veggies and fruits. Most everyone loves the classic childhood pairings of peanut butter with celery or apples. One of my favorite treats is dipping fresh strawberries into a decadent chocolate sauce. All you need is a half cup of an unsweetened milk, one tablespoon of chia seeds, one tablespoon of cocoa, one teaspoon of almond butter, and sweetener to taste. (I use one tablespoon of erythritol, discussed here.) Mix all the ingredients, and heat until the almond butter melts and the sweetener dissolves. Pour into a bowl, whisk until smooth, and put it in the fridge to cool. The chia and fiber from the cocoa powder help it thicken into an indulgent delight. (You can grind up the chia seeds first, but I like the tapioca-like texture the little chia balls form.)

Walnuts for the Win

Which nut is healthiest? Normally, my answer is whichever you’re most willing and able to eat regularly, but walnuts really do seem to take the lead. They have among the highest antioxidant3 and omega-34 levels, and they beat out other nuts in vitro in suppressing cancer cell growth.5 But how do walnuts fare outside the laboratory in real life?

PREDIMED is one of the largest interventional dietary trials ever performed. Interventional studies, if you remember, are those in which participants are randomized to different diets to see who fares better. This helps researchers avoid the problem of confounding variables when trying to determine cause and effect in cohort studies. For example, in major study6 after study7 after study,8 people who eat nuts tend to live longer and suffer fewer deaths from cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease. There was a lingering question, though: Did these findings show causation or merely correlation? It could be possible, after all, that nut eaters also tend to have other healthy lifestyle behaviors. Maybe those who eat nuts are more likely to be, well, health nuts. On the other hand, if scientists randomly assign thousands of people to various levels of nut consumption and the nuttier group ends up the healthiest, we could have more confidence that nuts aren’t just associated with better health but actually cause better health. This is what PREDIMED ended up doing.9

More than seven thousand men and women at high cardiovascular risk were randomized into different diet groups and followed for years. One of the groups received a free half pound of nuts every week. In addition to eating more nuts, they were told to improve their diets in other ways, such as eating more fruits and vegetables and less meat and dairy, but weren’t as successful at any of those other goals compared to the control group. Nevertheless, having a free half pound of nuts sent to them every week for four consecutive years did indeed persuade them to start eating more nuts.10 (It’s too bad the researchers couldn’t have slipped in a little free broccoli too!)

At baseline, before the study even started, the thousands assigned to the nut group were already eating about half an ounce of nuts a day. Thanks to the ensuing freebies, they ended up bumping up their consumption to a whole ounce (about a handful). As a result, the study was able to determine what happens when people at high risk for heart disease following a particular diet eat an extra half ounce of nuts every day.

With no significant differences in meat and dairy intake, there were no significant differences in saturated fat or cholesterol intake. So, unsurprisingly, there were no significant differences in their blood cholesterol levels or the subsequent number of heart attacks. However, the added-nuts group did end up having significantly fewer strokes. In a sense, all the dietary groups were eating stroke-promoting diets. People in all the groups had strokes after eating each of the diets for years—so, ideally, they’d instead choose diets that can stop or reverse the disease process rather than encourage it. But for those not willing to make major shifts in their diet, just the minor tweak of adding nuts appeared to cut stroke risk in half.11 Those in the extra-nut-eating group still had strokes, but only about half as many. If this works as well in the general population, eighty-nine thousand strokes a year would be prevented in the United States alone. That would be like ten strokes an hour, around the clock, prevented simply by adding about four walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts to the nation’s daily diet.

Regardless of which group participants were assigned to, those eating more nuts each day had a significantly lower risk of dying prematurely overall.12 Those who consumed more red- and yellow-light sources of fat—olive oil or extra virgin olive oil—failed to have any survival benefit.13 This is consistent with the way Ancel Keys, the so-called father of the Mediterranean diet, viewed olive oil. He thought of its benefit more as a means of replacing animal fats—that is, anything to get people to eat less lard and butter.14

Of all the nuts studied in PREDIMED, the researchers found the greatest benefits associated with walnuts, particularly for preventing cancer deaths.15 People who ate more than three servings of walnuts per week appeared to cut their risk of dying from cancer in half. A review of the scientific literature concluded that “the far-reaching positive effects of a plant-based diet that includes walnuts may be the most critical message for the public.”16

The Power of a Pea-“Nut”

Did you know that peanuts actually aren’t nuts? Technically, they’re legumes, but they’re often lumped together with true nuts in dietary surveys and studies, so it’s been hard to tease out their effects. Harvard University researchers worked to change that in the Nurses’ Health Study by specifically asking people about their peanut butter intake. They found that women at high risk for heart disease who ate nuts or a tablespoon of peanut butter five or more days a week appeared to nearly halve their risk of suffering a heart attack compared to women who ate a serving or less per week.17 This cross-protection between true nuts and peanuts also appears to extend to fibrocystic breast disease. Adolescent girls in high school who consumed just one or more servings of peanuts a week appeared to have significantly lower risk of developing lumpy breasts, which can be a marker for increased breast cancer risk.18 PB&J to the rescue!

Nuts and Obesity: Weighing the Evidence

Nuts and nut butters are packed with nutrition—and calories. For example, just two tablespoons of a nut or seed butter might contain nearly two hundred calories. Nevertheless, it’s probably better to eat two hundred calories of nut butter than two hundred calories of what most Americans would eat otherwise. Given how concentrated nut calories are—you’d have to eat nearly an entire head of cabbage to get the same amount—if you add a serving of nuts to your daily diet, won’t you gain weight?

To date, there have been about twenty clinical trials on nuts and weight, and not a single one showed the weight gain you might expect. All the studies showed less weight gain than predicted, no weight gain at all, or weight loss—even after study subjects added a handful or two of nuts to their daily diets.19 However, these studies lasted just a few weeks or months. Perhaps prolonged nut consumption leads to weight gain? That question has been examined six different ways in studies lasting up to eight years. One found no significant change, and the other five measures found significantly less weight gain and reduced risk of abdominal obesity in those who ate more nuts.20

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. If calories, which are units of energy, can’t just disappear, then where are they all going? In one trial, for instance, participants who ate up to 120 pistachios as an afternoon snack every day for three months didn’t appear to gain a pound.21 How could thirty thousand calories vanish into thin air?

One theory offered was dubbed the Pistachio Principle: Maybe nuts just take a lot of work to eat. Pistachios are typically bought in their shells, which slows consumption time, allowing your brain to better regulate your appetite.22 Sounds plausible, but what about shelled nuts like almonds and cashews? A study out of Japan did suggest that increasing “dietary hardness” (meaning chewing difficulty) is associated with a slimmer waist.23 Perhaps all that chewing simply tires you out?

Then there’s the fecal-excretion theory. Many of the cell walls of chewed almonds, for example, remain intact in the gastrointestinal tract. In other words, it’s possible a lot of the calories in nuts just never get digested and wind up in your waste because you didn’t chew well enough. Both of these theories were put to the test by an international group of researchers who gave participants either a half cup of unshelled peanuts or a half cup of peanuts ground into peanut butter. If either the Pistachio Principle or the fecal-extraction theory were correct, the peanut-butter group would gain weight, since no calories would be left in undigested nuts, and no calories would be burned chewing. But in the end, neither group gained weight, so there must be another answer.24

What about the dietary-compensation theory? The idea here is that nuts are so satiating and good at suppressing appetite that you end up eating less food overall. This could explain why some studies found that people lost weight after eating nuts. To test this idea, Harvard Medical School researchers gave two groups smoothies with the same number of calories, but one contained walnuts, and the other didn’t. Despite drinking the same amount of calories, the placebo (nut-free) smoothie group reported feeling significantly less full than the walnut group.25 So, yes—it does seem that nuts can make you feel fuller faster than some other foods.

At this point, it looks as if 70 percent of nut calories are lost through dietary compensation and 10 percent are flushed as fat in your feces.26 But what about the last 20 percent? Unless all the calories are accounted for, you would still expect some weight gain. The answer appears to lie in the ability of nuts to boost metabolism. When you eat nuts, you burn more of your own fat. Researchers have found that while control-diet subjects were burning about twenty grams of fat within an eight-hour period, a group eating the same number of calories and fat, but with walnuts included in their diet, burned off more—about thirty-one grams of fat.27 If a pill could do that, drug companies would be raking it in!

The bottom line? Yes, nuts are high in calories, but through a combination of dietary compensation mechanisms, your body’s failure to absorb some of the fat, and increased fat-burning metabolism, nuts can be a lifeline without expanding your waistline.

Pistachio Nuts for Sexual Dysfunction

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the recurrent or persistent inability to attain or maintain an erection for satisfactory sexual performance. It is present in up to thirty million men in the United States and approximately one hundred million men worldwide.28 Wait a second. The United States has less than 5 percent of the world’s population yet up to 30 percent of the impotence? We’re number one!

The reason may be due to our artery-clogging diet. Erectile dysfunction and our number-one killer, coronary artery disease, are actually two manifestations of the same disease—inflamed, clogged, and crippled arteries—regardless of which organs are affected.29 Not to worry, though, because Americans have red, white, and blue pills like Viagra … right? The problem is that these pills just cover up the symptoms of vascular disease and don’t do anything for the underlying pathology.

Atherosclerosis is considered a systemic disorder that uniformly affects all major blood vessels in the body. Hardening of the arteries can lead to softening of the penis, since stiffened arteries can’t relax open and let the blood flow. Thus, erectile dysfunction may just be the flaccid tip of the iceberg in terms of a systemic disorder.30 For two-thirds of men showing up at emergency rooms with crushing chest pain, their penises had been trying to warn them for years that something was wrong with their circulation.31

Why does atherosclerosis tend to hit the penis first? The arteries in the penis are half the size of the “widow-maker” coronary artery in the heart. Therefore, the amount of plaque you wouldn’t even feel in the heart could clog half the penile artery, causing symptomatic restriction in blood flow.32 This is why erectile dysfunction has been called “penile angina.”33 In fact, by measuring blood flow in a man’s penis with ultrasound, doctors can predict the results of his cardiac stress test with an accuracy of 80 percent.34 Male sexual function is like a penile stress test, a “window into the hearts of men.”35

In medical school, we were taught the forty-over-forty rule: 40 percent of men over age forty have erectile dysfunction. Men with erection difficulties in their forties have a fiftyfold increased risk of having a cardiac event (like sudden death).36

We used to think of erectile dysfunction in younger men (those under age forty) as “psychogenic”—meaning it’s all in their heads. But now we’re realizing that ED is more likely an early sign of vascular disease. Some experts believe that a man with erectile dysfunction—even if he doesn’t have cardiac symptoms—“should be considered a cardiac … patient until proved otherwise.”37

The reason even young men should care about their cholesterol levels is because they predict erectile dysfunction later in life,38 which in turn predicts heart attacks, strokes, and a shortened life span.39 As one medical journal put it, the take-home message is that “ED = Early Death.”40

What does this have to do with nuts? A clinical study found that men who ate three to four handfuls of pistachios a day for three weeks experienced a significant improvement in blood flow through the penis, accompanied by significantly firmer erections. The researchers concluded that three weeks of pistachios “resulted in a significant improvement in erectile function … without any side effects.”41

This is not just a male issue. Women with higher cholesterol levels report significantly lower arousal, orgasm, lubrication, and sexual satisfaction. Atherosclerosis of the pelvic arteries can lead to decreased vaginal engorgement and “clitoral erectile insufficiency syndrome,” defined as “failure to achieve clitoral tumescence [engorgement].” This is thought to be an important factor in female sexual dysfunction.42 We learned from the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study that eating just two handfuls of nuts weekly may extend a woman’s life as much as jogging four hours a week.43 So eating healthier may not only extend your love life but also your entire life.

Why are beans, nuts, and whole grains so health promoting? Maybe it’s because they are all seeds. Think about it: All it takes for an acorn to explode into an oak tree is water, air, and sunlight. Everything else is contained within the seed, which possesses the entire complex of protective nutrients required to mature into a plant or tree. Whether you’re eating a black bean, a walnut, a grain of brown rice, or a sesame seed, in essence you’re getting the whole plant in a tiny little package. As two noted nutrition experts concluded, “[D]ietary recommendations should embrace a wide array of seeds as part of a plant-based dietary pattern…”44

Nuts may be the easiest and tastiest Daily Dozen check box to check off. For those with peanut or tree nut allergies, seeds and seed butters can often be used as safe alternatives. But what about nut consumption if you have diverticulosis? For fifty years, doctors have told patients with this common intestinal condition to avoid nuts, seeds, and popcorn, but when the issue was finally put to the test, it turns out these healthy foods actually appear to be protective.45 So diverticulosis shouldn’t stop you from meeting this Daily Dozen mark, either. This one simple and delicious act could add years to your life without adding on pounds.

Herbs and Spices

Dr. Greger’s Favorite Herbs and Spices

Allspice, barberries, basil, bay leaves, cardamom, chili powder, cilantro, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, curry powder, dill, fenugreek, garlic, ginger, horseradish, lemongrass, marjoram, mustard powder, nutmeg, oregano, smoked paprika, parsley, pepper, peppermint, rosemary, saffron, sage, thyme, turmeric, and vanilla

Daily Recommendation:

¼ teaspoon of turmeric, along with any other (salt-free) herbs and spices you enjoy

Here’s a simple tip: Use your senses to pick out healthy foods. There is a good biological reason you should be so attracted to the vibrant colors found in the produce aisle: In many cases, the colors are the antioxidants. You can figure out which of two tomatoes has more antioxidants just by looking at which has a deeper red color. Of course, the food industry tries to hijack this natural instinct for colorful foods with abominations like Froot Loops, but if you stick to green-light foods, you can let color guide you. The same is true, we’re now realizing, with flavor.

Just as many of the plant pigments are beneficial, scientists are discovering that many of the flavor compounds in herbs and spices are powerful antioxidants as well.1 Guess where the antioxidant rosmarinic acid is found? What about cuminal, thymol, and gingerols? The flavors are the antioxidants. You can use this knowledge to help you make decisions at the grocery store. You can see that red onions have more antioxidants than white, and you can taste that regular onions have more antioxidants than mellower, milder Vidalia-type onions.2

The bitter and pungent compounds in the cruciferous and allium families are thought to be responsible for their health benefits. Intense colors and intense flavors can be signs of intense benefit. For optimum health, you should try to eat both colorful and flavorful foods. Indeed, the dietary guidelines for a number of countries now specifically encourage the consumption of herbs and spices, not only as a substitute for salt but for the healthy properties they have in their own right.3 And on the top of my list of healthful herbs and spices is turmeric—a spice that is both colorful and flavorful.

Why You Should Include Turmeric in Your Daily Diet

In recent years, more than five thousand articles have been published in the medical literature about curcumin, the pigment in turmeric that gives it that bright yellow color. Many of these papers sport impressive-looking diagrams suggesting that curcumin can benefit a multitude of conditions with a dizzying array of mechanisms.4 Curcumin was first isolated more than a century ago, yet out of the thousands of experiments, only a few in the twentieth century were clinical studies involving actual human participants. But since the turn of the century, more than fifty clinical trials have tested curcumin against a variety of diseases, and dozens more studies are on the way.5

We have seen how curcumin may play a role in preventing or treating lung disease, brain disease, and a variety of cancers, including multiple myeloma, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer. But curcumin has also been shown to help speed recovery after surgery6 and effectively treat rheumatoid arthritis better than the leading drug of choice.7 It also may be effective in treating osteoarthritis8 and other inflammatory conditions, such as lupus9 and inflammatory bowel disease.10 In the latest trial for ulcerative colitis, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study found that more than 50 percent of patients achieved remission within just one month on curcumin compared to none of the patients who received the placebo.11 If you are as convinced as I am that you should include turmeric in your diet to benefit from its pigment curcumin, the next questions, then, are: how much do you eat, how do you eat it, and what are the risks?

A Quarter Teaspoon of Turmeric Every Day

Turmeric is potent stuff. If I took a sample of your blood and exposed it to an oxidizing chemical, researchers could quantify the damage it caused to the DNA in your blood cells with sophisticated technology that allows them to count the number of breaks in DNA strands. If I then gave you a single pinch of turmeric to eat once a day for a week, redrew your blood, and again exposed your blood cells to the same free radicals, you would see that with the tiny bit of turmeric on board, the number of cells with DNA damage could be cut in half.12 That’s not mixing turmeric with cells in a petri dish—that’s having you ingest the spice and then measuring the effects in your blood. And this was not some fancy curcumin supplement, not some turmeric extract. It was just the plain spice you can buy at any grocery store. And, the dose was tiny, about one-eighth of a teaspoon.

Now that’s powerful!

The doses of turmeric that have been used in human studies range from less than one-sixteenth of a teaspoon up to nearly two tablespoons a day.13 Few adverse effects have been reported even at high doses, but the studies typically have lasted only a month or so. We don’t know what long-term effects of high doses there may be. Because turmeric can have such powerful drug-like effects, until we have better safety data, I would not advise anyone to take more than the culinary doses that have a long-standing record of apparent safety. How much is that? Though traditional Indian diets can include up to about a teaspoon of turmeric daily, the average intake in India is closer to a quarter teaspoon a day.14 So that’s how much I recommend you get as part of your Daily Dozen.

How to Eat Turmeric

Primitive peoples often used spices in sophisticated ways. For instance, quinine from cinchona bark was used to treat the symptoms of malaria long before the disease was even identified, and the raw ingredients of aspirin have been used as a popular painkiller long before Mr. Friedrich Bayer came along.15 Over the last twenty-five years, about half of new drug discoveries have come from natural products.16

There’s a plant in South Asia called adhatoda (adu, meaning “goat,” and thoda, meaning “not touch”—it’s so bitter even the goats won’t eat it). Its leaves are steeped with pepper to make a folk remedy effective for treating asthma. Somehow it was figured out what scientists didn’t discover until 1928: Adding pepper vastly boosted the plant’s antiasthmatic properties. And now we know why. About 5 percent of black pepper by weight is composed of a compound called piperine, which accounts for pepper’s pungent flavor and aroma. But piperine is also a potent inhibitor of drug metabolism.17 One of the ways your liver gets rid of foreign substances is by making them water soluble so you can pee them out. This black pepper molecule, however, inhibits that process, thereby boosting blood levels of the medicinal compounds in adhatoda—and it can do the same for curcumin in turmeric root.

Within an hour of eating turmeric, curcumin appears in your bloodstream, but only in small traces. Why only scant amounts? Presumably, your liver is actively working to get rid of it. But what if you suppress that elimination process by eating some black pepper? If you consume the same amount of curcumin but add a quarter teaspoon of black pepper, the level of curcumin in your blood shoots up by 2,000 percent.18 Even just the littlest pinch of pepper, just one-twentieth of a teaspoon, can significantly boost curcumin blood levels.19 And guess what is a common ingredient in many curry powders besides turmeric? Black pepper. Curry powder in India is also often served with a source of fat, which alone can enhance the bioavailability of curcumin seven- to eightfold.20 (Unfortunately, traditional knowledge appeared to fail here as to the best source of that fat. Indian cuisine employs a great deal of clarified butter, or ghee, which may explain the country’s relatively high rates of heart disease despite its otherwise relatively healthy diet.21)

My favorite way to incorporate turmeric is to use fresh turmeric root. Any large Asian market should carry it in the produce aisle. It looks like skinny fingers of gingerroot, but when you snap it open, you are greeted by the most unreal, Day-Glo, fluorescent-orange color. My quarter teaspoon of dried turmeric recommendation translates into about a quarter inch of fresh turmeric root. The roots are about two inches long, cost about ten cents each, and can last for weeks in the fridge or basically forever in the freezer. Every year you can go to the store and buy a twelve-month supply of fresh turmeric for about five dollars.

There’s evidence to suggest that the cooked and raw forms may have different properties. Cooked turmeric appears to offer better DNA protection, while raw turmeric may have greater anti-inflammatory effects.22 I enjoy it both ways. I use a grater to add my daily quarter inch into whatever I may be cooking (or right onto a cooked sweet potato), or I throw a raw slice into a smoothie. You probably won’t even taste it. Fresh turmeric has a much more subtle flavor than dried, so it may be an especially good option for those who don’t like turmeric’s taste. You will see it, though. Be careful—it can stain clothing and surfaces. Turmeric may not just make your health golden but your fingertips, as well.

Consuming turmeric with soy may offer a double benefit for osteoarthritis sufferers.23 Scrambled tofu is the classic turmeric-soy combination, but let me share two of my favorites: one raw and one cooked. You can whip up a pumpkin pie smoothie in less than three minutes. Simply blend a can of pumpkin purée, a handful of frozen cranberries and pitted dates, pumpkin pie spice to taste, a quarter-inch turmeric slice (or quarter-teaspoon of powder), and unsweetened soy milk to reach your preferred consistency.

Another favorite is my pumpkin custard (aka crustless pie). All you need to do is blend one can of pumpkin purée with about ten ounces of silken tofu (the Mori-Nu brand is convenient because it stays fresh without refrigeration), as much pumpkin pie spice as you like, and one to two dozen pitted dates (depending on how much of a sweet tooth you have). Pour into a dish and bake at 350°F until cracks appear on the surface. By skipping the piecrust and sticking with a custard, you’re left with vegetables, tofu, spices, and fruit. The more you eat, the healthier you are.

Fresh or powdered, turmeric is a natural flavor fit for Indian and Moroccan cuisines, but I add it to most anything. I find it pairs particularly well with brown rice dishes, lentil soup, and roasted cauliflower. Prepared yellow mustard typically already has turmeric in it for color, but try to find a salt-free variety—one that’s essentially just vinegar, a cruciferous vegetable (mustard seeds), and turmeric. I can’t think of a healthier condiment.

What About Turmeric Supplements?

Wouldn’t it be more convenient to just take a curcumin supplement every day? Added expense aside, I see three potential downsides. First, curcumin is not equivalent to turmeric. Supplement manufacturers often fall into the same reductionist trap as the drug companies do. Herbs are assumed to have only one main active ingredient, so the thinking goes that if you can isolate and purify it into a pill, you should be able to boost the effects. Well, curcumin is described as the active ingredient in turmeric,24 but is it the active ingredient or just an active ingredient? In fact, it’s just one of many different components of the whole-food spice.25

Few studies have compared turmeric with curcumin, but some that have suggest that turmeric may work even better. For example, researchers at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas pitted both turmeric and curcumin against seven different types of human cancer cells in vitro. Against breast cancer, for instance, curcumin kicked butt, but turmeric kicked even more butt. The same was true against pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, multiple myeloma, myelogenous leukemia, and others—turmeric came out on top, above just its yellow pigment curcumin. These findings suggest that components other than curcumin can also contribute to anticancer activities.26

Although curcumin is believed to account for most of turmeric’s health-promoting activities, research published over the past decade has indicated that curcumin-free turmeric—turmeric with the so-called active ingredient removed—may be as effective as or even more effective than turmeric with curcumin. There are turmerones, for example, in turmeric (but processed out of curcumin supplements) that may exhibit both anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. I naïvely assumed that the researchers who discovered this would advocate that people consume turmeric rather than take curcumin supplements, but instead, they suggested the production of all sorts of different turmeric-derived supplements.27 After all, who can make any money on a whole food that costs pennies a day?

My second concern involves dosing. While the turmeric trials have used modest amounts that could conceivably be achieved through diet, curcumin-only trials have tested the amount of curcumin found in entire cupfuls of turmeric spice—one hundred times more than what curry lovers have been eating for centuries.28 Some supplements add black pepper as well, potentially boosting levels to the equivalent of twenty-nine cups a day of turmeric, which might result in enough curcumin in the blood to potentially cause DNA damage based on in vitro data.29

Finally, there is a concern about contamination with toxic metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, and lead. None of the tested samples of powdered turmeric on the U.S. market has been found to be contaminated with heavy metals, but the same cannot be said of curcumin supplements.30

None of these concerns (except cost) applies to supplements containing only whole ground turmeric powder. Nearly all turmeric supplements are extracts, however. How else could they get away with selling a small bottle of pills for twenty dollars when the bulk spice may be less than twenty dollars a pound? A bottle might last two or three months. For the same price, bulk turmeric could offer two or three years’ worth at Daily Dozen dosing.

One compromise between convenience and cost may be to make your own turmeric capsules. There are capsule-stuffing gadgets that allow you to fill your own. Given the cost discrepancy between bulk turmeric and supplements, such a gadget would probably pay for itself after your first batch. A “00”-sized capsule would fit a day’s quarter-teaspoon dose. Making your own capsules might be a little time consuming, but if you won’t otherwise consume turmeric in your daily diet, it might be time well spent. If there were ever such thing as a magic pill, single-ingredient, ground turmeric root would probably come closest.

//****************************
Who Should Not Take Turmeric

If you suffer from gallstones, turmeric may trigger pain. Turmeric is a cholecystokinetic agent, meaning it facilitates the pumping action of the gallbladder to keep bile from stagnating.31 Ultrasound studies show that a quarter teaspoon of turmeric causes the gallbladder to contract, squeezing out half of its contents.32 In this way, it may help prevent gallstones from forming in the first place. But what if you already have a stone obstructing your bile duct? That turmeric-induced squeeze could be painful.33 For everyone else, though, the effect of turmeric would be expected to reduce the risk of gallstone formation and ultimately even reduce the risk of gallbladder cancer.34

Too much turmeric, however, may increase the risk of certain kidney stones. Turmeric is high in soluble oxalates, which can bind to calcium and develop into the most common form of kidney stone—insoluble calcium oxalate, which is responsible for about 75 percent of all cases. Those who have a tendency to form those stones should probably restrict consumption of total dietary oxalate to no more than 50 mg per day. This would mean no more than a teaspoon of turmeric daily at most.35 (Turmeric, by the way, is considered safe during pregnancy, but curcumin supplements may not be.36)

*   *   *

My recommended daily quarter teaspoon of turmeric is in addition to whatever other (salt-free) herbs and spices you enjoy. The reason the Daily Dozen encourages herb and spice consumption in general and not just turmeric is not because they’re all interchangeable—turmeric appears to have unique benefits—but because there’s evidence other herbs and spices have health benefits as well. I’ve talked about the role of saffron, for example, in the treatment of Alzheimer’s (chapter 3) and depression (chapter 12). Spices don’t just make food taste better; they make food better for you. I encourage you to keep a well-stocked spice cabinet and make it a habit to add whatever herbs and spices you find appealing to any dish you might be eating.

What follows here is a more in-depth examination of some of the herbs and spices for which we have the most scientific data. I will describe some of the fascinating studies that illustrate the benefits of these flavor boosters and explain some of the easiest ways to add them to your meals.


//
Peppermint

Which herbs have the most antioxidants? The most antioxidant-packed herb is dried Norwegian bearberry leaf. (Good luck finding that!) The most antioxidant-packed common herb is peppermint.73 That’s why I add mint to my favorite hibiscus cocktail recipe (see here) and why I try to add it to food whenever possible. Mint is a traditional ingredient in Middle Eastern salads like tabbouleh, Indian chutneys, and Vietnamese soups and fresh summer rolls. I like to put it into anything chocolaty as well.

//**********************************************
Oregano and Marjoram

Oregano is such an antioxidant-rich herb that researchers decided to test if it could reduce the DNA-damaging effects of radiation. Radioactive iodine is sometimes given to people with overactive thyroid glands or thyroid cancer to destroy part of the gland or mop up any remaining tumor cells after surgery. For days after the isotope injection, patients are so radioactive that they are advised not to kiss anyone or to sleep close to anyone (including their pets), and to maximize the distance between themselves and children or pregnant women.74 The treatment can be very effective, but all that radiation exposure appears to increase the risk of developing new cancers later on.75 Hoping to prevent the DNA damage associated with this treatment, researchers tested the ability of oregano to protect chromosomes of human blood cells in vitro from exposure to radioactive iodine. At the highest dose, chromosome damage was reduced 70 percent. The researchers concluded that oregano may “act as a potent radioprotective agent.”76

Other petri-dish studies with oregano suggest anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. In a comparison of the effects of various spice extracts—bay leaves, fennel, lavender, oregano, paprika, parsley, rosemary, and thyme—oregano beat out all but bay leaves in its ability to suppress cervical cancer cell growth in vitro while leaving normal cells alone.77 Of 115 different foods tested for anti-inflammatory properties in vitro, oregano made it into the top five, along with oyster mushrooms, onions, cinnamon, and tea leaves.78

Marjoram is a closely related herb and also shows promise in laboratory studies. It appears to significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro.79 None of these studies on oregano family herbs was done on people, though, so we have no idea how, if at all, these effects will translate to a clinical setting. One of the only randomized, controlled trials I’m aware of is a study of marjoram tea for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The tea was purportedly used in traditional herbal medicine to “restore hormonal balance,” so researchers decided to put it to the test. They instructed women with PCOS to drink two cups of marjoram tea on an empty stomach every day for a month. Beneficial effects on hormone levels were observed, which, the researchers concluded, “may justify the improvement claimed by traditional medicine practitioners and patients.”80

Cloves

The most antioxidant-packed common spice is the clove.81 It has an exceptionally strong flavor, so try adding just a teensy pinch to anything you’d normally put cinnamon or ginger on. Ground cloves are great on stewed pears and baked apples, giving them a pleasant, mulled cider taste, and a mug of chai tea is a fantastic way to pack in a bunch of high-impact common spices at once.

//******************************************************************8
Amla

The most antioxidant-packed uncommon spice is amla,82 which is powdered dried Indian gooseberry fruit. As a Western-trained physician, I had never heard of amla despite its common use in Ayurvedic herbal preparations. I was surprised to find four hundred articles on this lesser-known spice in the medical literature, and even more surprised to find papers with titles like “Amla … a Wonder Berry in the Treatment and Prevention of Cancer.” Amla is arguably the most important plant in Ayurvedic medicine, used traditionally as everything from a neutralizer of snake venom to a hair tonic.83 I eat it because it’s apparently the single most antioxidant-packed green-light food on Earth.84

Using an argon laser, researchers can measure and track human carotenoid antioxidant levels in real time. The most important finding from this body of work is that antioxidant levels can plummet within two hours of an oxidatively stressful event. When you’re stuck in traffic breathing diesel fumes, deprived of sleep, or suffering from a cold, for example, your body starts using up some of its antioxidant stores. What may only take two hours to lose can take up to three days to build back up.85

Even ordinary body processes, such as turning food into energy, can produce free radicals. This is okay as long as the food you eat comes prepackaged with antioxidants. But if it doesn’t—if you chug straight sugar water, for example—the level of free radicals and oxidized fat in your bloodstream rises over the next few hours, while vitamin E levels drop as your body’s antioxidant stores are expended.86 If you were to eat the same amount of sugar in the form of an orange, though, you wouldn’t get a spike in oxidation.87 Researchers concluded: “This argues strongly for the need to include high antioxidant foods in each and every meal in order to prevent this redox [free-radical versus antioxidant] imbalance.”88

The standard American diet (SAD) isn’t exactly antioxidant packed. Here is the antioxidant content (in modified FRAP assay daμmol antioxidant units) of some typical American breakfast foods: bacon (7) and eggs (8), a bowl of corn flakes (25) with milk (10), an Egg McMuffin (11), pancakes (21) with maple syrup (9), and a bagel (20) with cream cheese (4). A typical breakfast may average about 25 antioxidant units.89

Compare those to the smoothie I had for breakfast this morning. I started with a cup of water (0), a half cup of frozen blueberries (323), and the pulp of a ripe mango (108). I added a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds (8), along with a half cup of fresh mint leaves (33) and a palmful of bulk white tea leaves (103). (For more about tea leaves, see here.) While the typical SAD breakfast may give you only about 25 antioxidant units, my breakfast smoothie offered more than 500. And, when I add the final ingredient, a single teaspoon of amla, I get an additional 753 antioxidant units. That’s about four cents’ worth of amla, and it just doubled the antioxidant content of my entire smoothie. Before I’ve even fully woken up, I’ve already consumed more than 1,000 antioxidant units. That’s more than the average person may get in an entire week. I could drink my smoothie and eat nothing but doughnuts for the rest of the week, and most people still wouldn’t catch up. Notice that even though I packed the blender with amazing foods like blueberries and tea leaves, fully half the antioxidant power came from that single, four-cent teaspoon of powdered gooseberries.

You can buy amla online or at any Indian spice store. Ayurvedic herbal supplements are typically something you’d want to stay away from, as they have been found to be heavily contaminated with heavy metals,90 some of which are actually added intentionally.91 But none of the samples of powdered amla tested so far has been found to be contaminated. You can find whole Indian gooseberries in the frozen section of Indian grocery stores, but frankly, I find them inedible—astringent, sour, bitter, and fibrous all at the same time. The powder isn’t much tastier, but it can be disguised in something with a strong flavor, like a smoothie. Alternatively, you could pack amla into capsules like the turmeric. Whenever I’m out on the road on a speaking tour, I try to take daily capsules of turmeric and amla until I can get back home and wrest back control over my diet.

//
Spice Mixes

While there have been a considerable number of studies done with individual spices, few have looked at increasing spice consumption in general. One group at Pennsylvania State University did compare the effects of a high-fat chicken meal with and without a mixture of nine herbs and spices. Herbs and spices were chosen because, ounce for ounce, they have more antioxidants than any other food group (and because the study was funded by the McCormick spice company).92

Unsurprisingly, the people in the spice group experienced a doubling of the antioxidant power in their bloodstreams compared to participants in the spice-free group. Remarkably, though, the spice group ended up with 30 percent less fat (triglycerides) in their blood after the meal and improved insulin sensitivity. The researchers concluded that “the incorporation of spices into the daily diet may help normalize postprandial [after-meal] disturbances in glucose [sugar] and lipid [fat] homeostasis [control] while enhancing antioxidant defense.”

But why experience such disturbances in the first place? The study reminds me of those that show eating greens is particularly protective against cancer among smokers.93 That is, the take-home message shouldn’t be telling smokers to eat greens—it should be telling smokers to quit smoking. Of course, they could do both, which in the context of the spice study would mean adopting an antioxidant-rich, green-light diet, offering the best of both worlds.

Some of my favorite spice mixes are pumpkin pie spice, curry powder, chili powder, Chinese five-spice powder, a savory Indian spice blend called garam masala, an Ethiopian blend called berbere, Italian seasoning, poultry seasoning, and a Middle Eastern blend called za’atar. Spice mixes are a convenient way to provide a balance of flavors while boosting the variety of your spice intake, but make sure to check that the mixes are salt-free.

Is Liquid Smoke Safe?

I don’t know how I lived so long without smoked paprika. I swear it tastes like barbecue potato chips. After I first discovered it, I became a smoked-paprika zealot and put it on almost everything, but now I reserve it mostly for greens and when toasting fresh squash and pumpkin seeds. (I’ll bet you aren’t surprised to learn that’s my favorite part of Halloween!) I was concerned there might be carcinogenic combustion products in smoked seasonings (similar to the benzo[a]pyrene found in cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust), but these compounds tend to be fat soluble. So when you smoke a spice or make a water-based solution like liquid smoke, the smoke flavor compounds are captured without capturing most of the smoke cancer compounds. The same can’t be said for smoked fatty foods. While you’d have to chug three bottles of hickory smoke flavoring to exceed the safety limit, a smoked ham or smoked turkey sandwich could take you halfway there, and a single barbecued chicken leg would take you over the top. Smoked fish, such as herring or salmon, appears to be the worst. One bagel with lox could take you ten times over the safety limit.


//***********************************
Some Risks to Spicing Up Your Life

There are a few spices, however, of which you can have too much of a good thing. Take poppy seeds, for example.

The opium poppy used to make heroin is the same opium poppy that produces the poppy seeds in muffins and bagels. The idea that poppy seeds could serve as the source of appreciable amounts of narcotics was not given much credence despite the existence of an old European custom recommending a poppy seed–filled pacifier to quiet a noisy baby.95 It wasn’t given much credence, that is, until a mother tried giving her six-month-old some strained milk in which she had boiled some poppy seeds with the very best intentions of helping the child sleep better. The baby stopped breathing—but luckily survived.96

The cases of poppy seed overdose aren’t limited to children. There’s another case in the literature of an adult who felt “dim feelings in the head” after eating spaghetti with a half cup of poppy seeds on top.97 So what’s the upper limit of poppy seed consumption that’s probably safe? Based on median morphine levels,98 about one teaspoon for every ten pounds of body weight. This means that someone weighing about 150 pounds should probably eat no more than five tablespoons of raw poppy seeds at a time.99

Cooking may wipe out half of the morphine and codeine contained naturally in poppy seeds, which gives you some more leeway when baking.100 Soaking the poppy seeds for five minutes and then discarding the water before adding the seeds to your recipe can eliminate half of that remaining, if you’re making some poppy seed–filled pastry or other baked goods for children. Otherwise, there shouldn’t be any risk at usual levels of intake—unless you’re going in for a drug test, in which case you may want to avoid poppy seeds altogether.101

Too much nutmeg can also be a problem. A paper entitled “Christmas Gingerbread … and Christmas Cheer: Review of the Potential Role of Mood Elevating Amphetamine-like Compounds…” suggested that certain natural constituents of spices like nutmeg may form amphetamine compounds within the body sufficient “to elevate the mood and to help provide some added Christmas cheer” during the holiday season.102

This hypothetical risk was raised as far back as the 1960s in the New England Journal of Medicine in an article called “Nutmeg Intoxication.”103 The paper pondered whether the age-old custom of adding nutmeg to eggnog arose from the “psychopharmacological effect” described in cases of nutmeg intoxication. Such cases evidently go back to the 1500s, when nutmeg was used as an abortifacient to induce a miscarriage.104 In the 1960s, the spice was used as a psychotropic drug.105 During that decade, mental health professionals concluded that while nutmeg “is much cheaper for use and probably less dangerous than the habit-forming heroin, it must be stated that it is not free from danger and may cause death.”106

The toxic dose of nutmeg is two to three teaspoons. I had assumed no one would ever come close to that amount unintentionally until I saw a report in which a married couple ate some pasta, collapsed, and were subsequently hospitalized. What had happened was a big mystery until the husband revealed that he had accidentally added one-third of a jar of nutmeg to the meal while cooking.107 That’s about four teaspoons of the spice. I don’t know how they could have eaten it! I imagine the poor wife was just trying to be polite.

Another popular and powerful spice is cinnamon, which has been prized for its ability to lower blood sugar levels.108 It works so well that you can even “cheat” on a diabetes test by consuming two teaspoons of cinnamon the night before. Twelve hours later, your blood sugar spike in response to meals will still be significantly dampened.109 Even just a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference.110 Unfortunately, cinnamon can no longer be considered a safe and effective treatment for diabetes.

There are two main types of cinnamon: Ceylon cinnamon and cassia cinnamon (also known as Chinese cinnamon). In the United States, anything simply labeled “cinnamon” is probably cassia, since it’s cheaper. This is unfortunate, because cassia contains a compound called coumarin, which may be toxic to the liver at high doses. Unless it’s specifically labeled Ceylon cinnamon, a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon even a few times a week may be too much for small children, and a daily teaspoon would exceed the tolerable upper safety limit for adults.111 Can’t you just switch to Ceylon cinnamon and get the benefits without the risks? Without the risks, yes, but we’re no longer so sure about the benefits.

Nearly all the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been performed with cassia. We’ve just assumed that the same would apply for the safer Ceylon cinnamon, but it was only recently put to the test. The nice blunting of blood sugars you see in response to cassia cinnamon disappeared when the researchers tried using Ceylon cinnamon instead.112 In fact, all along it may actually have been the toxic coumarin itself that was the active blood-sugar-lowering ingredient in the cassia cinnamon. Thus, sidestepping the toxin by switching to Ceylon cinnamon may sidestep the benefit. So, in a nutshell, when it comes to lowering blood sugars, cinnamon may not be safe (cassia), or it may be safe, but apparently not effective in reducing blood sugar (Ceylon).

I still encourage Ceylon cinnamon consumption, given that it is one of the cheapest common food sources of antioxidants, second only to purple cabbage. But what’s a type 2 diabetic to do? Even the cassia cinnamon only brought down blood sugars modestly—in other words, it was only as good as the leading diabetes drug in the world, metformin, sold as Glucophage.113 Yes, cassia cinnamon may work as effectively as the leading drug, but that’s not saying much. The best way to treat diabetes is to attempt to cure it entirely with a healthy diet. (See chapter 6.)


//************************** Whole Grains *****************************************
Eat Whole … Within Minutes

Eating whole grains should be more than just swapping out white bread for whole wheat and white rice for brown. There is a wonderful universe of whole grains out there. You may have tried quinoa, but what about kañiwa or fonio? Even wild rice (which is not actually even rice) may not sound as wild as the grain called freekeh. Have fun and try some amaranth, millet, sorghum, or teff to expand the amber waves of your horizon. Buckwheat is my mom’s favorite.

As with vegetables, use color to make decisions at the grocery store. If you have a choice, pick red quinoa over white quinoa, blue corn over yellow, and yellow corn over white. Beyond just comparing antioxidant content, there’s experimental evidence to suggest that pigmented rice—red, purple, or black—has benefits over brown. For example, in addition to having about five times more antioxidants,48 colored rice varieties have shown greater antiallergy activity in vitro,49 as well as superior anticancer effects against breast cancer50 and leukemia cells.51

For convenience’s sake, there are a number of quick-cooking grains: amaranth, millet, regular oats, quinoa, and teff can all be prepared in less than twenty minutes. For grains that take longer, such as barley, farro, or steel-cut oats, consider cooking a big pot in advance on the weekend so you can simply reheat for your meals throughout the week. Or get a rice cooker—you can buy one for less than twenty dollars.

Whole-wheat pasta cooks in about ten minutes. Improved production technologies have created a new generation of whole-grain pastas that no longer have the rough and mealy texture of yesteryear. My favorite brand is Bionaturae because of its deliciously nutty taste—try it with my Eight Check-Mark Pesto.

Dr. Greger’s Eight Check-Mark Pesto

2 cups fresh basil leaves

¼ cup freshly toasted walnuts

2 cloves fresh garlic

¼ of a peeled lemon

¼ teaspoon lemon zest

¼ inch of fresh turmeric root (or ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder)

¼ cup pinto beans

¼ cup water or liquid from bean can

1 tablespoon white miso

Pepper to taste

Combine all ingredients in a food processor. Blend until smooth.

Scoop onto a cup and a half of cooked whole-grain pasta.

Popcorn is a whole grain that takes less than five minutes to prepare. A hot-air popper is another inexpensive, useful appliance. There’s an endless variety of savory, sweet, and spicy toppings you can use. I like the combination of chlorella and nutritional yeast. (In my family, the green color earned it the name “zombie corn.”) By lightly misting air-popped popcorn with a spray bottle, you can get dry seasonings to stick. I like to spritz with balsamic vinegar. Be sure to stay away from artificial butter flavorings. Originally, we thought the artificial butter flavor chemical diacetyl was just an occupational health hazard, resulting in the deaths of workers who handled the chemical from a condition that became known as “popcorn lung.”52 Now we know consumers are also at risk, given a case series of serious lung disease thought to be caused by butter-flavored microwave popcorn consumption.53

There are even one-minute whole-grain options: fully precooked bowls and pouches of brown rice and quinoa that can be microwaved and don’t even need to be refrigerated—just heat and eat.


//***********************************************************
The Five-to-One Rule

If you buy packaged grain products, anything labeled on the front with words like “multigrain,” “stone-ground,” “100% wheat,” “cracked wheat,” “seven-grain,” or “bran” is usually not a whole-grain product. They’re trying to distract you from the fact that they’re using refined grains. Here, color may not help. Ingredients like “raisin juice concentrate” are used to darken white bread to make it look healthier. Even if the first word in the ingredients list is “whole,” the rest of the ingredients could be junk.

I suggest using the Five-to-One Rule. When buying healthier, whole-grain products, look at the Nutrition Facts label on the package and see if the ratio of grams of carbohydrates to grams of dietary fiber is five or less (see figure 7). For example, let’s see if 100 percent whole-wheat Wonder Bread passes the test: Per serving, the package lists 30 grams of carbohydrates and 3 grams of fiber. Thirty divided by 3 is 10. Well, 10 is more than 5, so the 100 percent whole-wheat Wonder Bread goes back on the shelf even though, technically, it’s a whole-grain product. Compare that to Ezekiel bread, a sprouted-grain bread based on a biblical verse. It has 15 grams of carbohydrates and 3 grams of fiber, and, just like that, passes the test. So do Ezekiel english muffins, which taste great with fruit-only jam and nut butter. Though the science on the potential benefits of sprouted grains is still in its infancy, available data look promising.

Apply the same Five-to-One Rule to breakfast cereals, another grocery category that can lull you into believing nearly everything is healthy. Multi-Grain Cheerios, for example, sounds good, but it has a ratio over 7. And then it just goes downhill from there with Frosted Cheerios and Fruity Cheerios, which have carbohydrate-to-fiber ratios that exceed 10. Compare that with Uncle Sam cereal, sliding in with a ratio under 4. Others that make the cut include some no-added-sugar puffed-grain cereals like puffed barley, but the healthiest whole grains are the least processed, the so-called intact grains.

******************************************************************
Even though wheat berries, shredded wheat, whole-wheat flour, and puffed-wheat cereal may all be 100 percent whole wheat, they are handled by the body very differently. When grains are ground into flour or puffed, they are digested more rapidly and more completely. This increases their glycemic index and leaves fewer leftovers for the friendly flora down in your colon.

Researchers have experimented with this by splitting people into two groups. One group ate nuts, seeds, and beans more or less intact. The other group ate the same exact foods, but ground into flours and pastes. The first group ate nuts instead of nut butters, whole chickpeas instead of hummus, and muesli instead of muesli ground into a cream-of-wheat texture. Note that both groups were eating whole foods, just in different forms.

What happened? The intact-whole-grain diet group doubled their stool size, which was significantly greater than that of the ground-whole-grain group, even though they were eating the same foods in the same quantities.55 How is that possible? There is so much more left over for your gut flora to eat when you eat your grains intact. Few people realize that the bulk of stool is not undigested food but pure bacteria—trillions and trillions of bacteria.56 That may be why you get an increase of nearly two ounces of stool for every one ounce of fiber you eat. That’s not just water weight—you’re feeding your good bacteria so they can be fruitful and multiply.57

As the study demonstrated, when you eat grains intact, even if you chew your food thoroughly, pieces of whole seeds and grains transport starch and other goodies all the way down to your colon for your flora to feast on.58 But when grains are unnaturally processed into flour, almost all of the starch is digested in the small intestine, and you end up starving your microbial self. When that happens regularly, it can result in dysbiosis, an imbalance in which bad bacteria can take over and increase your susceptibility to inflammatory diseases or colon cancer.59 The moral of the story: Whole grains are great, but intact whole grains may be even better.

Instead of a puffed brown-rice cereal, how about just brown rice? Brown rice for breakfast may sound weird, but warm bowls of grains are traditional breakfast foods in many parts of the world. There are savory versions, or you can sweeten it up with fresh, frozen, dried, or freeze-dried berries. There are online sites where you can buy freeze-dried strawberries in bulk for less than a dollar per cup.

//*****************************************************************************
Oats

Oatmeal, of course, is the classic whole-grain breakfast. Just as cruciferous vegetables and flaxseeds harbor beneficial compounds found in abundance nowhere else, oats contain a unique class of anti-inflammatory compounds called avenanthramides. They’re thought to be responsible in part for the fresh odor and flavor of oats60 as well as the ability of oatmeal lotion to relieve skin itching and irritation.61 Studies on human skin fragments from plastic surgery that were subjected to inflammatory chemicals reveal that oatmeal extract can suppress inflammation62—so much that oatmeal now appears to be the treatment of choice for certain serious chemotherapy-induced skin rashes.63 Ironically, two of the cancer cell lines found to be resistant to that type of chemotherapy64 were found to be sensitive to avenanthramides in vitro, suggesting that people should be applying oatmeal to their insides as well.65 Oatmeal is more than just a whole grain.66

Oatmeal is my go-to breakfast when I travel. If there isn’t a nearby Starbucks where I can pick up some oatmeal, I prepare instant oatmeal with dried fruit in the coffeemaker in my hotel room. At home, if you want to spice up your oatmeal routine, Google “savory oatmeal” for all sorts of interesting dishes involving sautéed mushrooms, herbs, spinach, curry, roasted vegetables—you name it!

*   *   *

The Daily Dozen calls on you to eat three servings of whole grains a day. This might seem like a lot, but when you look at the actual size of those recommended servings, it’ll be a snap for you to succeed. Just one pasta dish at an Italian restaurant may average the equivalent of six servings!67 A morning oatmeal habit is a great way to kick-start your day, and then there are a variety of quick-cooking whole grains that serve as convenient, filling ways to fight chronic disease risk all day long.


//****************************
Coffee

I have already discussed the benefits of coffee for the liver (chapter 8), mind (chapter 12), and brain (chapter 14). What about overall longevity? Do people who drink coffee live longer lives than people who don’t?

The National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study, the largest-ever prospective study conducted on diet and health, put that question to the test. Yes, drinking lots of coffee is associated with a longer life, but the effect is relatively modest. People who drank six or more cups per day had a 10–15 percent lower mortality rate due to fewer deaths from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections.29 However, when a study looked at people under the age of fifty-five, the opposite effect was found: Drinking more than six cups of coffee daily was found to increase the risk of death. “Hence,” the researchers concluded, “it may be appropriate to recommend that younger people, in particular, avoid heavy coffee consumption (less than 28 cups per week or less than 4 cups in a typical day).”30

The bottom line, based on all the best studies to date, is that coffee consumption may indeed be associated with a small reduction in mortality,31 on the order of a 3 percent lower risk of premature death for each cup of coffee consumed daily.32 Don’t worry, it’s not “wake up and smell the coffee or don’t wake up at all”—the findings are less prescriptive than they are reassuring for those concerned about their coffee addiction.

Coffee is not for everyone. For example, be careful if you have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). While a population study found no link between coffee consumption and subjective symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn and regurgitation,33 scientists who actually stuck tubes down people’s throats to measure their pH found that coffee does seem to induce significant acid reflux, whereas tea does not. Caffeine does not appear to be the culprit, since caffeinated water doesn’t cause a problem. However, the coffee decaffeination process seems to reduce the level of whichever compounds are responsible, since decaf coffee appeared to cause less reflux. The researchers advised that people who suffer from GERD should consider switching to decaf or—even better—drink tea instead.34

Daily coffee consumption is also associated with a slightly increased risk of bone fractures among women, but, interestingly, a decreased fracture risk among men.35 However, no association was found between coffee and hip fracture risk. Conversely, tea may reduce hip fracture risk36 but appears to have no significant effect on fracture risk in general.37 This is an important distinction, because hip fractures are associated with a shortened life span more than other types of bone fractures.

People with glaucoma,39 or perhaps even with merely a family history of glaucoma,40 may also want to stay away from caffeinated coffee. Coffee intake is associated with urinary incontinence in both women41 and men.42 And there are case reports of individuals with epilepsy having fewer seizures after laying off coffee, so avoiding it is certainly worth a try for people with seizure disorders.43 Finally, it almost goes without saying that people who have trouble sleeping might not want to drink too much coffee. Just a single cup at night can cause a significant deterioration in sleep quality.44

The mystery as to why some studies showed that coffee consumption increased cholesterol and others did not was solved when it was discovered that the cholesterol-raising compound thought to be responsible was fat soluble. The culprit compound, cafestol, is found in the oils of coffee beans that become trapped in the paper filter, so drip coffee doesn’t raise cholesterol as much as french press, boiled, or Turkish (“mud”-style) coffee. Neither the degree of roasting nor decaffeination appears to make a difference, though Robusta beans have less cafestol than Arabica beans. If you don’t have optimal cholesterol levels, you should consider sticking to filtered coffee or using instant coffee, which also lacks these compounds.45 If these tweaks don’t help, consider eliminating coffee completely, as even paper-filtered coffee may raise cholesterol levels a small amount.46

We used to think caffeine might increase the risk of an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, but this was based on anecdotal case reports involving the acute ingestion of very large quantities of caffeine47 (including a case blamed in part on a woman’s “chocolate intake abuse”).48 As a result, the erroneous notion that caffeine ingestion may trigger abnormal heart rhythms became “common knowledge,” an assumption that led to changes in medical practice. More recently, however, actual studies were performed that revealed caffeine intake does not appear to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation after all.49 Moreover, “low-dose” caffeine, which was defined as drinking fewer than about six cups of coffee a day, may even have a protective effect on heart rhythm.50

Moderate caffeine consumption in healthy, nonpregnant adults is not only safe but has been found to increase energy and alertness and enhance physical, motor, and cognitive performance.51 Despite these benefits, one medical journal editorialized that doctors should “temper any message that suggests that caffeine is beneficial … given the proliferation of energy drinks that contain massive quantities of caffeine…”52 Indeed, drinking a dozen highly caffeinated energy drinks within a few hours could cause a lethal caffeine overdose.53 That said, drinking a few cups of coffee a day may actually extend your life a bit54 and even has the potential to slightly lower your overall cancer risk.55

I cannot recommend drinking coffee, though. Why? Because every cup of coffee is a lost opportunity to drink a potentially even healthier beverage—a cup of green tea.

The Best Sweetener

In chapter 12, I shared research suggesting that adding sugar may negate some of the benefits of beverages, while adding artificial sweeteners like aspartame or saccharine may even make things worse. Are there any health-promoting sweeteners? The only two concentrated, green-light sweeteners may be blackstrap molasses and date sugar. Other natural caloric sweeteners, such as honey, less processed cane sugars, and maple, agave, and brown rice syrups don’t appear to have much to offer nutritionally.87 Date sugar is a whole food—just dried dates ground up into a powder—as are date and prune pastes, which can be homemade or purchased. These are all good options for baking, but for sweetening drinks, the taste of molasses may be too strong, and the whole-food sweeteners don’t fully dissolve.

How about stevia? During the 1990s, research out of Japan found that steviosides, the “active” ingredient in stevia, appeared harmless. But in the guts of rats, intestinal bacteria transformed steviosides into a toxic substance called steviol, which can cause a big spike in mutagenic DNA damage in vitro.88 Unfortunately, it turns out that humans have the same bacterial activity in their guts.89 It’s the dose that makes the poison, though. The World Health Organization considers up to 1.8 mg of stevia compounds per pound of body weight to be a safe amount. Given the American sweet tooth, though, if we sweetened everything with stevia, you could exceed that safety limit. But just drinking up to two stevia-sweetened beverages a day should be considered harmless.90

The sugar alcohols sorbitol and xylitol are harmless in themselves, but they aren’t absorbed by the body and end up in the colon, where they can draw in fluid and cause diarrhea. This is why they’re only used commercially in small quantities, such as in mints or chewing gum, as opposed to beverages. A related compound, however, erythritol, is absorbed and may have the harmlessness of xylitol without the laxative effect.

Erythritol is found naturally in pears and grapes, but industrially, yeast is used to produce it. Erythritol doesn’t cause cavities,91 and it hasn’t been implicated in fibromyalgia,92 preterm birth,93 headaches,94 hypertension,95 brain disorders,96 or platelet disorders97 like other low-calorie sweeteners. Moreover, erythritol may actually have some antioxidant properties.98 As with any highly processed product, though, its utility should be confined to increasing your consumption of green-light foods. So, for example, if the only way for you to eat half a grapefruit is to sprinkle some sugar on it, then it’s probably better to eat a sugared grapefruit than no grapefruit at all—though sprinkling it with erythritol would be even better. With this logic in mind, I use erythritol to increase my consumption of cranberries (remember my Pink Juice recipe in chapter 8?), cocoa powder (see here), and hibiscus tea.

//
My Hibiscus Punch

In 2010, an antioxidant analysis of three hundred different beverages was published, examining everything from Red Bull to red wine.99 And the winner is … hibiscus tea! I documented its potent antihypertensive effects in chapter 7. I’ve always had “normal” blood pressure by U.S. standards, but I wanted to shoot for optimal, so hibiscus became a daily staple for me. Give this recipe a try:

To eight cups of water, add a handful of bulk dried hibiscus or four bags of tea in which hibiscus is the first ingredient. Then add the juice of one lemon and three tablespoons of erythritol, and leave it in your fridge to cold-brew overnight. In the morning, strain out the hibiscus or take out the tea bags, shake well, and drink throughout the day. That’s something I try to do every day I’m home.

For extra credit, add green foam: Pour a cup of the tea into a blender with a bunch of fresh mint leaves, blend on high, and enjoy. You end up with dark-green leafies blended into what may be the highest antioxidant beverage in the world, and it tastes like fruit punch. Your kids will love it!

As with any sour food or beverage, make sure to rinse your mouth with water after consumption to prevent the natural acids from dissolving your enamel.100 Do not brush your teeth within an hour after eating or drinking something sour, as your enamel may be in a softened state and be further damaged by brushing.101 If you sip continuously throughout the day, I suggest using a straw to bypass your teeth.102

Be careful, though. There are three ways that even harmless sweeteners could theoretically be harmful. Over the years, numerous large-scale studies have found a correlation between artificial-sweetener use and weight gain.103 The most common explanation for this counterintuitive finding is reverse causation: People aren’t fat because they drink diet soda; they drink diet soda because they’re fat.

But there are at least three other less benign alternative explanations. The first is called “overcompensation for expected caloric reduction.” If you covertly switch people’s soda for diet soda without their knowing it, their caloric intake drops.104 This makes sense, since they’re not drinking all that sugar anymore. But what if you fess up to what you did? People who knowingly consume artificial sweeteners may actually end up eating more calories; they may figure after their zero-calorie drink, they can indulge in that second piece of pie. Indeed that’s what studies have shown. For example, if you give subjects an aspartame-sweetened cereal for breakfast, but only inform half the participants that the sweetener was artificial, when lunchtime comes, the aspartame-informed group ends up eating significantly more than the aspartame-naïve group.105 I think of this concept anytime I see someone at a fast-food restaurant ordering a diet soda with their meal.

A second explanation for gaining weight while using artificial sweeteners is based on how humankind evolved: When your brain registers the sensation of sweetness on your tongue, millions of years of evolution remind your brain to boost your appetite to eat as much as possible—after all, naturally sweet plant foods like fruits or sweet potatoes are among the healthiest. When you drink a can of diet soda, your brain thinks you just stumbled across a wild blueberry bush, and it sends urgent signals to eat large and eat fast before someone else gets wind of your bounty. At the same time, your body knows that if you eat too many calories, you might get too fat and not be able to outrun that saber-toothed tiger, so when your gut senses that you’ve absorbed enough calories, it sends signals up to your brain to urge you to stop eating. When you ingest low-calorie sweeteners, however, you experience the familiar hunger-boosting effect due to the sensation of sweetness on your tongue, yet you may lack the hunger-suppressing effect of calories entering your gut. The result can be a revved-up appetite that can lead to eating more food than you otherwise would have.106 That’s the second way diet soda could counterintuitively lead to weight gain.

The third way involves maintaining cravings for, and dependency on, all things sweet. By continuing to consume any sweeteners—with or without calories—you are unable to train your flavor preferences away from intensely sweet foods.107 Let’s say that you use erythritol at home. That’s great, but what happens when you go on vacation and don’t have ready access to it? Your preference for intensely sweet food travels with you, and that may end up translating into the increased consumption of less-than-healthy foods.

The bottom line? Erythritol seems safe, but only if you don’t use it as an excuse to eat more junk food. With great sweetness comes great responsibility.

Drink five glasses of water a day, be they plain tap water or flavored with fruit, tea leaves, or herbs. Keeping hydrated may elevate your mood (and vigor!), improve your thinking, and even help cut your risk for heart disease, bladder cancer, and other diseases. Bottoms up!



//****************************************************************
					How not to diet
-------------------------------------------------------------------

“Often the loudest, most extreme voices drown out the well informed,” wrote two noted nutrition professors on the subject of diet books. “There is also money to be made.”6

Lots of money. Every month seems to bring us a trendy new diet or weight-loss fad, and they always sell because they always fail. The diet industry may rake in up to $50 billion a year, and the business model is based on repeat customers.7 Racked with the guilt and self-hatred of failure, people often line right back up to be fooled again. I hope this book can help break that cycle by cutting through the BS.

Beyond the corrupting influence of commercial interests are the ideological biases. Too often in diet books, the rule is to obfuscate rather than illuminate, cherry-pick facts to push some pet theory, and ignore the rest to promote your own agenda. It’s the opposite of science. In true scholarship, your conclusions follow from the evidence, not the other way around.

Unfortunately, even just sticking to the peer-reviewed scientific literature is not enough. An article in The New England Journal of Medicine on obesity myths concluded that “false and scientifically unsupported beliefs about obesity are pervasive” in medical journals as well.8 In that case, the only way to get at the truth is to dive deep into the primary literature and read all the original studies yourself rather than taking some contemporary reviewer’s word for it. But who’s got time for that? There are more than half a million scientific papers on the subject of obesity, with a hundred new ones published every day. Even researchers in the field might only be able to keep track of what’s going on in their narrow, subspecialized domains. But that’s precisely what we do at NutritionFacts.org. We comb through tens of thousands of studies a year so you don’t have to.


ISN’T A CALORIE A CALORIE?
Now that we see where the lines are drawn in the weight spectrum from optimal to obese, let’s review some basic assumptions. The notion that a calorie from one source is just as fattening as a calorie from any other source is a trope broadcast by the food industry as a way to absolve itself of culpability. Coca-Cola even put out an ad emphasizing this “one simple commonsense fact.”12 As the chair of Harvard’s nutrition department put it, this “central argument” from industry is that the “overconsumption of calories from carrots would be no different from overconsumption of calories from soda.”13 If a calorie is just a calorie, why does it matter what kinds of foods we eat?

Let’s take the example of carrots versus Coca-Cola. While it’s true that in a tightly controlled laboratory setting, 240 calories of carrots—ten carrots—would have the same effect on calorie balance as the 240 calories in a bottle of Coke,14 this comparison falls flat on its face out in the real world. You could chug down those liquid calories in less than a minute, but eating 240 calories of carrots could take you more than two and a half hours of constant chewing. (It’s been timed.15) Not only would your jaw get sore, but 240 calories of carrots is about five cups—you might not even be able to fit them all in your stomach. Like all whole plant foods, carrots have fiber, which adds bulk without adding net calories. What’s more, you wouldn’t even absorb all the carrot calories. As anyone who’s eaten corn can tell you, some bits of vegetable matter can pass right through you, flushing out any calories they contain. A calorie may still be a calorie circling your toilet bowl, but it’s not going to end up on your hips.

Even if you eat and absorb the same number of calories, a calorie may still not be a calorie. As you’ll learn, the same number of calories eaten at a different time of the day, in a different meal distribution, or after different amounts of sleep can translate into different amounts of body fat.

It’s not only what we eat but how and when.

And the same number on the scale can mean different things on different diets or in different contexts. You could be losing weight but actually gaining body fat if your body sheds water and muscle mass. So it’s not just about calories in versus calories out, eating less, and moving more. We’ll see an illustration of this later, with a famous series of studies on prisoners in Vermont that showed that, depending on what the researchers fed them, it could take up to one hundred thousand more calories to create the same amount of weight gain. So you’ll learn how they effectively made one hundred thousand calories disappear. But I’m getting ahead of myself.


If you do a survey of hundreds of policy-makers, most blame the obesity epidemic on “lack of personal motivation,”30 but that makes little sense. Here in the United States, for example, obesity shot up across the entire population in the late 1970s. Are you telling me that every sector of the U.S. population experienced some sort of simultaneous decline in willpower?31 Each age, sex, and ethnic group, with all their different attitudes and experiences, coincidentally lost their collective capacity for self-control at the same time?

More plausible than a global change in the nature of our characters would be some global change in the nature of our lives.


Fast Food vs. Slow Motion
The food industry blames inactivity. “If all consumers exercised,” said the CEO of PepsiCo, “obesity wouldn’t exist.”33 Coca-Cola went a step further and spent $1.5 million to create the Global Energy Balance Network to downplay the role of diet in the obesity epidemic. Leaked internal documents show the company planned on using the front group to serve as a “weapon” to “change the conversation” about obesity in its “war” with the public health community.34

This tactic is so common among food and beverage companies it even has a name: leanwashing. You’ve likely heard of greenwashing, where companies deceptively pretend to be environmentally friendly. Leanwashing is the term used to describe companies that try to position themselves as helping to solve the obesity crisis when, instead, they’re directly contributing to it.35 For example, Nestlé, the largest food company in the world, has rebranded itself the “world’s leading nutrition, health and wellness company.”36 Yes, that Nestlé, of Nestlé Nesquik fame, makers of Cookie Crisp cereal and more than one hundred different brands of candy, including Butterfinger, Kit Kat, Goobers, Gobstoppers, Runts, and Nerds. Another of its slogans is “Good Food, Good Life.” Its Raisinets may have some fruit, but the company seems to me more Willy Wonka than wellness. Let’s just say that on its “What is Nestlé doing about obesity?” web page, the “Read about our Nestlé Healthy Kids programme” link gave me a Page Not Found error.

The constant corporate drumbeat of overemphasis on physical inactivity appears to be working. In response to a Harris poll question (“Which of these do you think are the major reasons why obesity has increased?”), a large majority (83 percent) chose lack of exercise, while only 34 percent chose excessive calorie consumption.38 But blaming couch-potato-ness has actually been identified as one of the most common misconceptions about obesity.39 The scientific community has come to a fairly decisive conclusion40 that the factors governing caloric intake far more powerfully affect overall calorie balance.41


There’s even debate in the scientific literature as to whether changes in physical activity had “any role whatsoever” in the obesity epidemic.42 The increase in caloric intake per person is more than enough to explain the U.S.43 and global44 epidemics of obesity. In fact, if anything, the level of physical activity over the last few decades has gone up slightly in both Europe and North America, rather than declined.45 Ironically, this bump may be a result of the extra energy it takes to haul around our heavier bodies, making changes in energy expenditure a consequence of the obesity problem rather than the cause.

Formal exercise is only a small part of our total daily activity, though. Think how much more physical work people used to do on the job, on the farm, or even in the home.46 It’s not just the shift in collar color from blue to white. Increasing automation, computerization, mechanization, motorization, and urbanization have all contributed to increasingly more sedentary lifestyles over the last century—and therein lies the problem with the theory: The occupational shifts and advent of labor-saving devices have been gradual and largely predate the dramatic, recent rise in weight gain the world over.47 Washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and the Model T were all invented before 1910. And indeed, when put to the test using state-of-the-art methods to measure energy in and energy out, it was caloric intake, not physical activity, that predicted weight gain over time.

The common misconception that obesity is due mostly to lack of exercise may not just be a benign fallacy, as personal theories of causation appear to impact people’s weight. Those who blame insufficient exercise are significantly more likely to be overweight themselves. Put them in a room with chocolate, for instance, and they can be covertly observed consuming more candy compared to those who put the onus of obesity on poor diet.49 But you can’t know if such attitudes are playing a role in their weight problem until you put it to the test. So researchers randomized people to read a fictitious article implicating inactivity in the rise of obesity and found they indeed went on to eat significantly more sweets than those who instead were given an article that indicted diet.50 A similar study evidently found that those presented with research blaming genetics subsequently ate significantly more cookies. The paper was entitled “An Unintended Way in Which the Fat Gene Might Make You Fat.”

When it comes to obesity, the power of your genes is nothing compared to the power of your fork. Even the small influence the FTO gene does have appears to be weaker among those who are physically active61 and may be 
abolished completely in those eating healthier diets. FTO only appears to affect those eating diets higher in saturated fat (predominantly found in dairy, meat, and junk food). Those eating more healthfully appear to be at no greater risk of weight gain even if they inherited the “fat gene” from both their parents.62

Physiologically, FTO gene status doesn’t appear to affect your ability to lose weight.63 Psychologically, knowing you’re at increased genetic risk for obesity may motivate some people to eat and live more healthfully,64 but it may cause others to fatalistically throw their hands up in the air and resign themselves to thinking it just runs in their families.65 Obesity does tend to run in families, but so do lousy diets.

Comparing the weight of biological versus adopted children can help tease out the contributions of lifestyles versus genetics. Children growing up with two overweight biological parents were found to be 27 percent more likely to be overweight themselves, whereas adopted children placed in a home with two overweight parents were only 21 percent more likely to be overweight.66 So genetics certainly play a role, but this suggests that it’s more the children’s environment than their DNA.

Diet Trumps Genes

One of the most dramatic examples of the power of diet over DNA comes from the Pima Indians of Arizona, who have among the highest rates of obesity67 and diabetes68 in the world. This has been ascribed to their relatively fuel-efficient genetic makeup.69 Their propensity to store calories may have served them well in times of periodic scarcity when they were living off the land, but when the area became “settled,” their source of water, the Gila River, was diverted upstream. Those who survived the ensuing famine70 had to abandon their traditional diet to live off government food programs, and chronic disease rates skyrocketed.71 Same genes, but a different diet, leading to a different result.

In fact, a natural experiment was set up. The Pima living across the border in Mexico come from the same genetic pool but were able to maintain more of their traditional lifestyle, centered around the food staples known as the three sisters: corn, beans, and squash.72 Same genes, but about five times less diabetes and obesity.73

Genes may load the gun, but diet pulls the trigger.


Survival of the Fattest
It’s been said: “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.”74 The known genetic contribution to obesity may be small, but in a certain sense, you could argue it’s actually all in our genes. That’s because the excess consumption of available calories may be hardwired into our DNA.

We were born to eat. Throughout most of human history and beyond, we existed in survival mode, in a context of unpredictable scarcity, so we’ve been programmed with a powerful drive to eat as much as we can, while we can, and just store the calories we don’t need right away on our bodies for later. Food availability could never be taken for granted, so those who ate more in the moment and were best able to store more fat for the future might better survive subsequent shortages to pass along their genes. Generation after generation, millennia after millennia, those with lesser appetites may have died out, while those who gorged themselves could have selectively lived long enough to pass along a genetic predisposition to eat and store more calories. That may be how we evolved into such voracious, calorie-conserving machines. Now that we’re no longer in such lean times, though, we’re no longer so lean.


What I just described is the “thrifty gene” concept,75 the proposal that obesity is the result of a mismatch between the modern environment and the environment in which we evolved.76 It’s as if we’re now polar bears in a jungle; fur and fat may provide an edge up in the Arctic but would be decidedly disadvantageous in the Amazon.77 Similarly, a propensity to pack on the pounds may have been a plus in prehistoric times but can turn into a liability when our scarcity-sculpted biology is plopped down into the land of plenty.

So the prime cause for the obesity epidemic is neither gluttony nor sloth. Obesity may simply be a normal response to an abnormal environment.78

Much of our physiology is finely tuned to stay within a narrow range of upper and lower limits. If we get too hot, we sweat; if we get too cold, we shiver. Our bodies have mechanisms to keep us in balance. In contrast, our bodies have had little reason to develop an upper limit to the accumulation of body fat.79 In the beginning, there may have been evolutionary pressures to keep lithe and nimble in the face of predation, but thanks in part to weapons and fire, we haven’t had to outrun as many saber-toothed tigers over the last two million years or so.80 This may have left our genes with the one-sided selection pressures to binge on every morsel in sight and stockpile as many calories onto our bodies as possible.81

What was once adaptive is now a problem, or at least so says the thrifty gene hypothesis that originated more than a half century ago.82 The theory has since been refined and updated, but the basic premise remains largely accepted by the scientific community,83 and the implications are profound.

********************************************8
In 2013, the American Medical Association voted to classify obesity as a disease84 against the advice of its own Council on Science and Public Health.85 Not that it necessarily matters what we call it—a rose by any other name would cause just as much diabetes—but disease implies dysfunction. Bariatric drugs and surgery are not fixing some physiological malfunction. Our bodies are just doing what they were designed to do in the face of excess calories.86 Rather than some sort of disorder, weight gain may be largely a normal response, by normal people, to an abnormal situation.87 And with more than 70 percent of Americans now overweight,88 it’s literally normal.

(*************************************************************************************************)
Won’t Work for Food
The traditional medical view on obesity, as summed up nearly a century ago: “All obese persons are alike in one fundamental respect—they literally overeat.”89 While this may be true in a technical sense, it is in reference to overeating calories, not food. Our primitive urge to overindulge is selective. People don’t tend to lust for lettuce. We have a natural, inborn preference for sweet, starchy, fatty foods, because that’s where the calories are concentrated.

Think about hunting and gathering efficiency. We used to have to work hard for our food. Prehistorically, it wouldn’t have made sense to spend all day collecting types of food that, on average, don’t provide at least a day’s worth of calories. You would have been better off staying back at the cave. So we evolved to crave foods with the biggest caloric bang for their buck.90

If you were able to steadily forage a pound of food an hour and it had 250 calories per pound, it might take you ten hours just to break even on your calories for the day. But if you were gathering something with 500 calories a pound, you could be done foraging in five hours and spend the next five focusing on your wall paintings. 

So the greater the energy density, the more calories per pound, the more efficient the foraging. We developed an acute ability to discriminate foods based on calorie density and instinctively desire the densest.91

If you study the fruit and vegetable preferences of four- and five-year-old children, what they like correlates with calorie density. They prefer bananas over berries and carrots over cucumbers. Isn’t that just a preference for sweetness? No, they also prefer potatoes over peaches and green beans over melon,92 just like monkeys prefer avocados over bananas.93 We appear to have an inborn drive to maximize calories per mouthful.

The researchers in the studies of children only tested whole fruits and vegetables, so all the foods naturally had fewer than five hundred calories per pound, with bananas topping the chart at about four hundred. Something funny happens when you start going much above that: We lose our ability to differentiate between which foods have the highest caloric density. Over a natural range of calorie densities, we have an uncanny aptitude to pick out the subtle distinctions. However, once you start heading toward chocolate, cheese, and bacon territory, which can reach thousands of calories per pound, our perceptions become relatively numb to the differences. No wonder, since these foods were unknown to our prehistoric brains. Aberrant behavior explained by an evolutionary mismatch,94 like sea turtle hatchlings crawling in the wrong direction toward artificial light rather than the moon and never reaching the ocean, or dodo birds failing to evolve a fear response because they had no natural predators—and we all know how that turned out.


************************************************************
Full of CRAP
The food industry exploits our innate biological vulnerabilities by stripping down crops into almost pure calories—straight sugar, oil (which is pretty much pure fat), and white flour (which is mostly refined starch). First, they remove the fiber, because it effectively 
has zero calories. Run brown rice through a mill to make it white, and you lose about two-thirds of the fiber. Turn whole-wheat flour into white flour and lose 75 percent of the fiber. Or you can run crops through animals (to make meat, dairy, and eggs) and remove 100 percent of the fiber.95 What you’re left with is CRAP, an acronym conceived by one of my favorite dietitians, Jeff Novick, for calorie-rich and processed foods.96

Calories are condensed in the same way plants are turned into addictive drugs like opioids and cocaine: concentration, crystallization, distillation, and extraction.97 They even appear to activate the same reward pathways in the brain.98 Put people with “food addiction” in an MRI scanner and show them a picture of a chocolate milkshake, and the areas that light up in their brains are the same99 as when cocaine addicts are shown a video of smoking crack100 or when alcoholics are given a whiff of whiskey.101

Food addiction is a misnomer. People don’t suffer out-of-control eating behaviors to food in general. We don’t tend to compulsively crave cabbage. But milkshakes are packed with sugar and fat, two of the signals to our brains for calorie density. When people are asked to rate different foods in terms of cravings and loss of control, most incriminated was a load of CRAP—highly processed foods like donuts, along with cheese and meat.102 Those foods least related to problematic eating behaviors? Fruits and vegetables. Calorie density may be the reason people don’t get up in the middle of the night and binge on broccoli.

Animals don’t tend to get fat eating the foods they were designed to eat. There is a confirmed report of free-living primates becoming obese, but that was a troop of baboons who evidently stumbled across some dumpsters at a tourist lodge. The “garbage-feeding animals” weighed 50 percent more than their wild-feeding counterparts.103 Sadly, we, too, can suffer the same mismatched fate and become obese by eating garbage. For millions of years before we learned how to hunt, our biology evolved largely on leaves, roots, shoots, fruits, and nuts.104 Ironically, even the creationists agree that we started out plant-based in Eden’s garden.105 Maybe it would help if we went back to the basics and cut the CRAP.


************************************************************************************
Toxic Food Environment
It is hard to eat healthfully against the headwind of such strong evolutionary forces. No matter our level of nutrition knowledge, in the face of pepperoni pizza, the ancestral heritage baked into our genes screams, Eat it now!106 Anyone who doubts the power of basic biological drives should see how long they can go without blinking or breathing. Any conscious decision to hold your breath is soon overcome by the compulsion to breathe. In medicine, shortness of breath is sometimes even referred to as air hunger.

The battle of the bulge is a battle against biology, so obesity is not some moral failing. I can’t stress enough that becoming overweight is a normal, natural response to the abnormal, unnatural ubiquity of calorie-dense, sugary, and fatty foods.

The sea of excess calories in which we are now floating (and in which many of us are now drowning) has been referred to as a “toxic food environment.”107 This helps direct focus away from the individual and toward societal forces at work, such as the fact that the average child may be blasted with ten thousand food commercials a year. Or maybe I should say pseudo-food commercials, as 95 percent of the ads were found to be for candy, liquid candy (soft drinks), breakfast candy (sugary cereals), and fast food.108

Wait a second. If weight gain is just a natural reaction to the easy availability of mountains of cheap, tasty calories, then why isn’t everyone fat? Well, in a certain sense, most everyone is. It’s been estimated that more than 90 percent of American adults are “overfat,” defined as having excess body fat sufficient to impair health.109 This can occur even in normal-weight individuals (often due to excess abdominal fat), but even if you just look at the numbers on the scale, being overweight has become the norm. If you look at the bell curve, more than 70 percent of us are overweight. A little less than a third are on one side at normal weight and more than a third are on the other side, so overweight they’re obese.110

But if it really is the food, why doesn’t everyone get fat? That’s like asking, “If cigarettes really are to blame, why don’t all smokers get lung cancer?” This is where genetic dispositions and other exposures can weigh in to tip the scales.111 Different people are born with a different susceptibility to cancer, but that doesn’t mean smoking doesn’t play a critical role in exploding whatever inherent risk we have—and the same goes for obesity and our toxic food environment. We can try to tip the scales with smoking cessation and a more healthful diet.

If you lock up two dozen folks in a research study and feed each the exact same number of excess calories, they all gain weight, but some gain more than others. In one study, overfeeding the same thousand calories a day, six days a week for one hundred days caused weight gains ranging from about nine pounds to twenty-nine pounds. Some people are just more genetically susceptible. The twenty-four people in the study were twelve sets of identical twins, and the variation in weight gain between each of them was about a third less than between the unrelated subjects.112 A similar study with weight loss from exercise found a similar result.113 So, yes, genetics play a role, but that just means some people have to work harder than others. Ideally, inheriting a predisposition for extra weight gain shouldn’t give reason for resignation but rather motivation to put in the extra effort to unseal your fate.

Fattening Grandchildren from the Womb

Identical twins don’t just share DNA; they shared a uterus too. Might that also help account for some of their metabolic similarities? Fetal overnutrition, evidenced by an abnormally large birth weight, seems to be a strong predictor of obesity in childhood and later in life.114 Could it be that you are what your mom ate?

Who do you think most determines the birth weight of a test-tube baby—the donor mom who provided all the DNA, or the surrogate mom who provided the intrauterine environment? When it was put to the test, the womb won. Incredibly, a baby born to an obese surrogate mother with a skinny biological mom may harbor a greater risk of becoming obese than a baby from a big biological mom born to a slim surrogate. The researchers concluded that “the environment provided by the human mother is more important than her genetic contribution to birth weight.”115

The most compelling data come from comparing obesity rates in siblings born to the same mother before and after she had bariatric (weight loss) surgery.116 Compared to their brothers and sisters born after the surgery, those born when the mom weighed about one hundred pounds more had higher rates of inflammation and metabolic derangements, and, most critically, three times the risk of severe obesity (affecting 35 percent of those born before the weight loss, compared to 11 percent born after). The researchers concluded that “these data emphasize how critical it is to prevent obesity and treat it effectively to prevent further transmission to future generations.”117

But wait. Mom had the same DNA before and after the surgery. She passed down the same genes. How could her weight during pregnancy affect the weight destiny of her children any differently? We finally figured out the mechanism by which this can happen: epigenetics.

Epigenetics, which literally means above genetics, layers an extra level of information on top of the DNA sequence that can both be affected by our surroundings and potentially passed on to our children.118 This is thought to account for the “developmental programming”119 (also known as metabolic imprinting120) that can occur in the womb depending on the weight of the mother, or even the grandmother. Since all the eggs in an infant daughter’s ovaries are already preformed before birth,121 a mother’s weight status during pregnancy could potentially affect the obesity risk of her grandchildren too.122 Either way, you can imagine how this could result in a vicious intergenerational cycle where obesity begets obesity.

Is there anything we can do about it? Well, prevention may be the key. Given the epigenetic influence of maternal weight during pregnancy, a symposium of experts on pediatrics concluded that “planning of pregnancy, including prior optimization of maternal weight and metabolic condition, offers a safe means to initiate the prevention rather than treatment of pediatric obesity.”123 Easier said than done, but overweight moms-to-be may take comfort in the fact that even the moms in the study who had given birth to kids with three times lower risk of obesity were still, on average, obese themselves,124 suggesting that significant weight loss can help even if you’re not able to get down to a normal weight.


**************************************************************************88
What Happened in the 1970s?
The rise in the number of calories provided by the U.S. food supply since the 1970s is more than sufficient to explain the entire obesity epidemic.125 Similar spikes in calorie surplus were noted in developed countries around the world in parallel with,126 and presumed primarily responsible for,127 the expanding waistlines of their populations. By the year 2000, after taking exports into account, the United States was producing 3,900 calories a day for every man, woman, and child, nearly twice as much as many people need.128

The number of calories in the food supply actually declined over the first half of the twentieth century, only starting its upward climb to unprecedented heights in the 1970s.129 The drop in the first half of the century was attributed to the reduction in hard manual labor. The population had decreased energy needs, so they ate decreased energy diets. They didn’t need all the extra calories. But then, the so-called energy balance flipping point occurred. (Energy balance is the concept of calories in versus calories out.) Why did the “move less, stay lean” phase that had existed throughout most of the century turn into the “eat more, gain weight” phase that plagues us to this day?130 What changed to bring about this flipping point?

What happened in the 1970s was a revolution in the food industry. In the 1960s, most food was prepared and cooked in the home. The average housewife spent hours a day cooking and cleaning up after meals (the husband averaged nine minutes).131 But then a profound transformation took place. Technological advances in food preservation and packaging enabled manufacturers to mass prepare and distribute food for ready consumption. The metamorphosis has been compared to what had happened a century before in the Industrial Revolution with the mass production and supply of manufactured goods. This time, though, it was the mass production and supply of food. Using new preservatives, artificial flavors, and techniques such as deep freezing and vacuum packing, food companies could take advantage of economies of scale132 to mass-produce ready-made, durable, palatable edibles that offer an enormous commercial advantage over fresh and perishable foods.133 And the packaged food sector is now a multitrillion-dollar industry.134

Think ye of the Twinkie. With enough time and effort, any ambitious cook could create cream-filled cakes in their own kitchen, but today they are available at every turn for less than a dollar.135 If every time we wanted a Twinkie we had to bake it ourselves, we’d probably eat far fewer of them.136

Consider the humble potato. We’ve long been a nation of potato eaters, but they were largely baked or boiled. Anyone who has made fries from scratch knows what a pain it is, with all the peeling, cutting, and splattering. But with sophisticated machinations of mechanization, french fry production became centralized so fries could be shipped at -40°F to any fast-food deep-fat fryer or supermarket frozen food section in the country to become America’s favorite vegetable. Nearly all the increase in potato consumption in recent decades has been in the forms of french fries and potato chips.137

Cigarette production offers a compelling parallel. Before the automated rolling machine was invented, cigarettes had to be rolled by hand. It took fifty workers to produce the same number of cigarettes a machine could make in a single minute. After automation, cigarette prices plunged and production leaped into the billions.138 Cigarette smoking went from being relatively uncommon to almost everywhere. In the twentieth century, the average per capita cigarette consumption rose from 54 cigarettes a year to 4,345 by the time of the 1964 Surgeon General’s report.139 The average American went from smoking about 1 cigarette a week to 70. That’s a half pack a day.

********************************************************************************************
Tobacco itself was just as addictive before and after mass marketing. What changed was the much greater opportunity for cheap, easy access. French fries have always been tasty, but they went from being rare even in restaurants to omnipresent around every corner. You can probably even find them next to the gas station where you can get your Twinkies and cigarettes.

The first Twinkie dates back to 1930, though, and Ore-Ida started selling frozen french fries in the 1950s.140 So there has to be more to the story than just technological innovation.


****************************************************************************************************.
Aiding and Abetting
The rise in calorie surplus sufficient to explain the obesity epidemic was less a change in food quantity than in food quality, with an explosion in cheap, high-calorie, low-quality convenience foods. The federal government very much played a role in making this happen. U.S. taxpayers unwittingly give billions in subsidies to prop up the likes of the sugar industry, the corn industry and its high-fructose syrup, and the soybean industry, which processes about half of its crop into vegetable oil and the other half into cheap animal feed to help make Dollar Menu meat.141 When was the last time you sat down to some sorghum? Exactly. Why then do taxpayers give nearly a quarter billion dollars a year to the sorghum industry?142 It’s almost all fed to livestock.143 We’ve created a pricing structure that favors the production of sugars, oils, and animal products.

The first farm bill started out as an emergency measure during the Great Depression of the 1930s to protect small farmers, but subsequent ones were weaponized by Big Ag into cash cows with pork barrel politics.145 Agricultural policies in the United States and Europe have been deliberately designed to lower the costs of basic cash crops like sugar and staples like meat, wheat, dairy, and eggs.146 There is a lot of money at stake—and in steak. From 1970 to 1994, for example, global beef prices dropped by more than 60 percent.147 If it weren’t for taxpayers sweetening the pot with billions of dollars a year,148 high-fructose corn syrup would cost the soda industry about 10 percent more.149

Subsidies are one of the reasons chicken is so cheap. After one of the farm bills, corn and soy were subsidized below the cost of production for cheap animal fodder, effectively handing the poultry and pork industries around $10 billion each.150 That’s not chicken feed. Or rather, it is!

****************************************************************************************************.
This is changing what we eat. Thanks in part to subsidies, meats, sweets, eggs, oils, dairy, and soda were all getting relatively cheaper as the obesity epidemic took off (compared to the overall consumer food price index), whereas the relative cost of fresh fruits and vegetables doubled.151 This may help explain why, during about the same period, the percentage of Americans getting five servings of fruits and vegetables a day dropped from 42 percent to 26 percent.152 Why not subsidize produce instead? Because that’s not where the money is.

Whole foods, or minimally processed foods such as canned beans or tomato paste, are what’s referred to in the food business as commodities. They have such slim profit margins that they’re sometimes even sold at or below cost as “loss leaders” to attract customers in the hopes they’ll also buy the “value-added” products,153 the most profitable of which (for producers and vendors alike) are the ultraprocessed, fatty, sugary, and salty concoctions of artificially flavored, artificially colored, and artificially cheap ingredients, thanks to taxpayer subsidies.

Different foods reap different returns. Measured in profit per square foot of supermarket selling space, confectionaries like candy bars consistently rank among the most lucrative. Fried snacks like potato chips and corn chips are also highly profitable. PepsiCo’s subsidiary Frito-Lay brags that while its products represent only about 1 percent of total supermarket sales, they may account for more than 10 percent of the operating profits for supermarkets and 40 percent of profit growth.154

It’s no surprise then that the entire system is geared toward garbage. The rise in the calorie supply wasn’t just more food but more of a different kind of food. More than half of all calories consumed by most adults in the United States these days were found to originate from these subsidized foods, and we appear to be worse off for it. Those eating the most have significantly higher levels of chronic disease risk factors, including elevated cholesterol, inflammation, and body weight.155

There’s a dumb dichotomy about the drivers of the obesity epidemic: Is it the sugar or the fat? Both are highly subsidized, and both took off during the unfolding epidemic. Along with a significant rise in refined grain products, the rise in obesity was accompanied by about a 20 percent increase in per capita pounds of added sugars and a 36 percent increase in added fats156 (mostly in the form of oil,157 presumably from fried fast food and processed junk).158 Both added sugars and added fats now represent major sources of calories in the American diet.

****************************************************************************************************.
Quarter Pounder
In the 1970s, the U.S. government went from just subsidizing some of the worst foods to actually paying companies to make more of them. During that decade, the farm bills reversed long-standing policies aimed at limiting production to protect prices and instead started giving payouts in proportion to output.160 Extra calories began pouring into the food supply.

Then, in 1981, the CEO of General Electric gave a speech that effectively launched the “shareholder-value movement,” reorienting the primary goal of corporations toward maximizing short-term returns for investors.161 This placed extraordinary pressures on food companies from Wall Street to post increasing profit growth every quarter to boost their share prices. There was already a glut of calories on the market, and now they had to sell even more.

This puts food and beverage CEOs into a near impossible bind. It’s not like they’re rubbing their sticky hands together at the thought of luring more Hansels and Gretels to their doom in their houses of candy. Food giants cannot necessarily do the right thing if they wanted; they are beholden to investors. If they stopped marketing to kids or tried to sell healthier food or attempted anything that could jeopardize their quarterly profit growth, Wall Street could demand a change in management.162 Healthy eating is bad for business. It’s not some grand conspiracy—it’s not even anyone’s fault. It’s just how the system works.

Marketing Excesses
Given the constant demands for corporate growth and rapid returns in an already oversaturated marketplace, the food industry needed to get people to eat more. Like the tobacco industry before it, the food industry turned to the ad men—and in a big way.163 Tens of millions of dollars are now spent annually advertising a single brand of candy bar.164 McDonald’s alone spends billions a year.165 Thus far, the food industry has spent more money on advertising than any other sector of the economy.166

Reagan-era deregulation removed the limits placed on marketing food products on television to children.167 In addition to the ten thousand food ads children may see on TV a year,168 there is marketing content online, in print, at school, on their phones, at the movies, and everywhere in between.169 Nearly all of it is for products detrimental to their health.

****************************************************************************************************
Besides its massive early exposure171 and ubiquity, food marketing has become highly sophisticated. With the help of child psychologists, companies learn how best to influence children to manipulate their parents. Packaging is designed to most effectively attract a child’s attention and then placed at their eye level in the store.172 You know those mirrored bubbles in the ceilings of supermarkets? They’re not just for shoplifters. Closed-circuit cameras and GPS-like devices on shopping carts are used to strategize how best to guide shoppers toward the most profitable products.173 Behavioral psychology is widely applied to increase impulse buying, and even eye-movement tracking technologies are utilized.174

The unprecedented rise in the power, scope, and sophistication of food marketing starting around 1980 aligns well with the blastoff slope of the obesity epidemic. Since then, some of the techniques, such as product placement, in-school advertising, and event sponsorships, skyrocketed from essentially nothing to multibillion-dollar industries. This led at least one noted economist to conclude that “the most compelling single interpretation of the admittedly incomplete data we have is that the large increase in obesity is due to marketing.”175 Innovations in manufacturing and political maneuvering led to a food supply bursting at the seams with nearly four thousand calories a day for each one of us, but the critical piece may have been the advancements in marketing manipulations used to try to peddle that surplus into our mouths.


****************************************************************************************************
Wining and Dining
The opening words of the National Academy of Medicine’s report on the threat posed by food ads: “Marketing works.”177 Yes, there’s a large number of well-conducted randomized studies I could share with you to show how advertising exposure and other marketing methods can change your eating behavior and get you to eat more,178 but what do you need to know beyond the fact that the industry spends tens of billions of dollars on it?179 To get people to drink its brown sugar water, do you think Coca-Cola would spend a penny more than it thought it had to? It’s like when my medical colleagues accept invitations to “drug lunches” from pharmaceutical representatives and take offense that I would suggest it might affect their prescribing practices. Do they really think drug companies are in the business of giving away free money for nothing? They wouldn’t do it if it didn’t work. There is no free lunch.

Just to give you a sense of marketing’s insidious nature, let me share an interesting piece of research published in Nature, the world’s leading180 scientific journal. The article titled “In-Store Music Affects Product Choice” documented an experiment in which either French accordion or German Bierkeller music was played on alternate days in the wine section of a grocery store.181 On the days the French music played in the background, people were three times more likely to buy French wine, and on German music day, shoppers were about three times more likely to buy German wine. Despite the dramatic effect—not just a few percent difference but a complete threefold reversal—when approached afterward, the vast majority of shoppers denied the music had influenced their choices.



****************************************************************************************************
Like a Kid in a Candy Store

In addition to the $10 billion or so spent on advertising each year, the food industry spends around another $20 billion on other forms of marketing, such as trade shows, incentives, consumer promotions, and supermarket “slotting fees,”183 which are the purchasing of shelf space from grocery stores by food and beverage companies to prominently display their most profitable products. The practice is evidently known as cliffing, because companies are forced to bid against each other for eye-level shelf placement, with the loser being pushed “over the cliff.”184 With slotting fees up to $20,000 per item, per retailer, and per city,185 you can imagine what kinds of products get the special treatment. Hint: It ain’t broccoli.

To get a sense as to what types of products merit prime-shelf real estate, look no further than the checkout aisle. “Merchandising the power categories on every lane is critical,” reads a trade publication on the “best practices for superior checkout merchandising.” And what are the “power categories”? Candy bars and beverages. Evidently, even a 1 percent power category boost in sales could earn a store an extra $15,250 a year.186 It’s not that supermarkets don’t care about their customers’ health. It’s more that publicly traded companies (like most of the leading grocery store chains) are impelled to increase profits above other considerations.


****************************************************************************************************
Driven by Distraction
We all like to think we make important life decisions, such as what to eat, consciously and rationally. If that were the case, though, we wouldn’t be in the midst of an obesity epidemic.188 As I explore in the Habit Formation section, most of our day-to-day behavior does not appear to be dictated by careful, considered deliberations. Rather, we tend to make more automatic, impulsive decisions triggered by unconscious cues or habitual patterns, especially when we’re tired, stressed, or preoccupied. The unconscious parts of our brains are thought to guide human behaviors as much as 95 percent of the time,189 and this is the arena where marketing manipulations do most of their dirty work.

The parts of our brains that govern conscious awareness may only be able to process about fifty bits of information per second, which is roughly equivalent to a short tweet. Our entire cognitive capacity, on the other hand, is estimated to process in excess of ten million bits per second. Because we’re only able to purposefully process a limited amount of information at a time, our decisions can become even more impulsive if we’re distracted or otherwise unable to concentrate.190 An elegant illustration of this “cognitive overload” effect was provided by an experiment involving fruit salad and chocolate cake.

Before calls could be made at a touch of a button or the sound of our voice, the seven-digit span of a phone number was based in part on the longest sequence most people can recall on the fly. We only seem able to hold about seven chunks of information (plus or minus two) in our immediate, short-term memory.191 So this was the setup: Randomize people to memorize either a seven-digit number or a two-digit number to be recalled in another room down the hall. As they walk from one room to the other, offer each of them the choice of a fruit salad or a piece of chocolate cake. Memorizing a two-digit number is easy and presumably takes few cognitive resources. Under the two-digit condition, most chose the fruit salad. Faced with the same decision, most of those trying to keep seven digits in their heads just went for the cake.192

This can play out in the real world by potentiating the effect of advertising. Have people watch a TV show with commercials for unhealthy snacks, and, no surprise, they eat more unhealthy snacks compared to those exposed to nonfood ads. Or maybe that is a surprise. We all like to feel as if we’re in control and not so easily manipulated. The kicker is we may be even more susceptible the less we’re paying attention. Randomize people to the same two- or seven-digit memorization task while watching a TV show, and the snack-attack effect was magnified among those who were more preoccupied.193 How many of us have the TV playing in the background or multitask during commercial breaks? This research suggests that doing so may make us even more impressionable to the subversion of our better judgment.

There’s an irony in all of this. Calls for restrictions on marketing are often resisted by invoking the banner of freedom. What does that even mean in this context, when research shows how easily our free choices can be influenced without our conscious awareness?194 A senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation even went as far as to suggest that given the dire health consequences of our unhealthy eating habits, insidious marketing manipulations “should be considered in the same light as the invisible carcinogens and toxins in the air and water that can poison us without our awareness.”


****************************************************************************************************

Passive Overconsumption
Food and beverage companies frame body weight as a matter of personal choice. But even when we’re not distracted, the power of the “eat more” food environment may sometimes overcome our conscious controls over eating.196 One look around the room at a dietitians’ convention can tell you that even nutrition professionals are vulnerable to the aggressively marketed ubiquity of tasty, cheap, convenient calories. This suggests there are aspects of our eating behaviors that defy personal insight by flying below the radar of conscious awareness.197 Appetite physiologists call the result of these subconscious actions passive overconsumption.198

Remember that brain scan study where the thought of a milkshake lit up the same reward pathways in the brain as when cocaine addicts saw videos of smoking crack or alcoholics got a whiff of whiskey? That was triggered with just a picture of a milkshake. Intellectually, we know it’s only an image, but our lizard brains just see survival. Dopamine gets released, cravings get activated, and we’re motivated to eat. It’s simply a reflexive response over which we have seemingly little control, which is why marketers ensure there are pictures everywhere of milkshakes and the like.199

Maintaining a balance between calories in and calories out feels like a series of voluntary acts under conscious control, but it may be more akin to bodily functions, such as blinking, breathing, coughing, swallowing, or sleeping. You can try to will yourself power over any of these, but, by and large, they just happen automatically, driven by ancient scripts.


Of course, it matters what you’re overeating. Some foods, like many vegetables, have such a low calorie density that you would tire from chewing before you could overdo it. You’d have to eat a wheelbarrow full of cabbage before you’d ever need to begin worrying about overindulging. The portion-size effect has even been used to encourage healthier habits by dishing out extra veggies.213 So “simply telling people to eat less of everything may not be the most effective message,” wrote one of the principal investigators in the obesity field.214 Thus, this is not a call to buy baby carrots and cherry tomatoes. Size may matter, but substance is more salient.


****************************************************************************************************
Is Big Food Making Us Big Too?
The plague of tobacco-related deaths wasn’t just due to the mass manufacture and marketing of cheap cigarettes. Tobacco companies actively sought to make their products even more craveable by spraying the sheets of tobacco with nicotine and additives like ammonia to provide a bigger nicotine kick.225 The food industry employs taste engineers to accomplish a similar goal: maximize the irresistibility of their products.

Taste is the leading factor in food choice.226 Salt, sugar, and fat are used as the three points of the compass to create “superstimulating” “hyperpalatability” to tempt people into impulsive buys and compulsive consumption.227 Foods are designed intentionally to hook into our evolutionary triggers and breach whatever biological barriers help keep consumption within reasonable limits.228

Big Food is big business. The processed food industry alone brings in more than $2 trillion a year.229 That affords it the economic might to manipulate more than just taste profiles; it influences public policy and scientific inquiry as well. The food, alcohol, and tobacco industries have all used similar unsavory tactics: blocking health regulations, co-opting professional organizations, creating front groups, and distorting the science.230 The common playbook shouldn’t be surprising given the many common corporate threads—at one time, for example, cigarette giant Philip Morris owned both Kraft and Miller Brewing.231

In 2009, the food industry spent more than $50 million to hire 350 lobbyists to influence legislation, most of whom were “revolvers,” former federal employees in the revolving door between industry 
and its regulators. They could push corporate interests from the inside and then turn around and be rewarded with cushy lobbying jobs after their “public service.”232

In the following year, the food industry acquired a new weapon, a stick to go along with all those carrots. On January 21, 2010, the Supreme Court’s 5–4 Citizens United ruling permitted corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on campaign ads to trash anyone who dared stand against them.233 No wonder our elected officials have so thoroughly shrunk from the fight,234 leaving us largely with a government of Big Food, by Big Food, and for Big Food.235

Globally, a similar dynamic exists. Weak tea calls from the public health community for voluntary standards are met not only with vicious fights against meaningful change236 but also massive transnational trade and foreign investment deals that cement protection of food industry profits into the laws of the lands.237

The corrupting commercial influence even extends to medical associations. Reminiscent of the “Just what the doctor ordered” cigarette ads of yesteryear,238 the American Academy of Family Physicians has accepted millions from the Coca-Cola Company, in part to explicitly “develop consumer education content on beverages and sweeteners.”239 When the American Academy of Pediatrics was called out for its proud new corporate relationship with Coke and the company’s “invaluable commitment to children’s health,”240 an executive vice president of the academy tried to quell protest by explaining that this alliance was not without precedent: The American Academy of Pediatrics had had relationships with Pepsi and McDonald’s for some time.241

On the front line, fake grassroots “AstroTurf” groups are used to mask the corporate message. In the footsteps of Get Government Off Our Back, memorably acronymed GGOOB and created by R. J. Reynolds to fight tobacco regulation, the front group Americans Against Food Taxes may just as well be called Food Industry Against Food Taxes.242 The power of front-group formation was enough to bind two bitter corporate rivals, the Sugar Association and the Corn Refiners Association, and have them link arms with the American Beverage Association and the National Confectioners Association to partner together as Americans for Food and Beverage Choice.243

Another tried-and-true tobacco industry tactic:244 Research front groups like Coca-Cola’s Global Energy Balance Network can be used to subvert the scientific process by shaping245 or suppressing246 science that deviates from the corporate agenda. The trans fat story is one of many examples. Food manufacturers have not only long denied that trans fat was associated with disease,247 they actively worked to limit inquiry248 and discredit research findings.249

One estimate places the global death toll from foods high in trans fat, saturated fat, salt, and sugar at fourteen million lost lives. Every year.250 The inability of countries around the world to turn the tide on obesity “is not a failure of individual will-power,” said the director-general of the World Health Organization.251 “It is a failure of political will to take on the powerful food and soda industries.”252 She ended her keynote address entitled “Obesity and Diabetes: The Slow-Motion Disaster” before the National Academy of Medicine with these words: “The interests of the public must be prioritized over those of corporations.”253


****************************************************************************************************
We Have to Stop Eating Like This
When it comes to uncovering the root causes of the obesity epidemic, there appears to be a sort of manufactured confusion. Major studies assert the causes are “extremely complex” and “fiendishly hard to untangle.”254 Having just reviewed the literature, it doesn’t seem like much of a mystery to me.

It’s the food.

Attempts at obfuscation—rolling out hosts of implausible explanations like sedentary lifestyles or lack of self-discipline—serve the needs of the manufacturers and marketers more than the public’s health and the interest of truth.255 When asked about the role of restaurants in the obesity epidemic, the president of the 
National Restaurant Association replied, “Just because we have electricity doesn’t mean you have to electrocute yourself.”256 Yes, but much of the food industry is effectively attaching electrodes to shock and awe the reward centers in our brains to undermine our self-control.

Advances in processing and packaging, combined with government policies and handouts that fostered cheap commodities for the “food industrial complex,”257 led to a glut of ready-to-eat, ready-to-heat, or ready-to-drink products. To help assuage impatient investors, marketing became ever-more pervasive and persuasive. All these factors conspired to create unfettered access to copious, convenient, low-cost, high-calorie foods often willfully engineered with chemical additives to be hyperstimulatingly sweet or savory, yet only weakly satiating.

As we each sink deeper into a quicksand of calories, more and more mental energy is required to swim upstream against the constant bombardment of advertising and 24–7 panopticon of arm’s-length tempting treats.258 There’s so much food flooding the market now that much of it ends up in the trash. Food waste has progressively increased by about 50 percent since the 1970s.259 Perhaps better in the landfill, though, than filling up our stomachs. And too many of these cheap, fattening foods prioritize shelf life over human life.

But dead people don’t eat. Don’t food companies have a vested interest in keeping their consumers healthy? A question such as this reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the system. A public company’s primary responsibility is to reap returns for investors. Consider the fact that the tobacco industry produces products that kill one in two of its most loyal customers.260 It’s not about customer satisfaction but shareholder satisfaction. The customer always comes second.

Just as weight gain may be a perfectly natural reaction to a fattening food environment, governments and businesses are just responding normally to the political and economic realities of our system.261 Can you think of a single major industry that would benefit from people eating less junk? “Certainly not the agriculture, food product, grocery, restaurant, diet, or drug industries,” emeritus professor Marion Nestle wrote in a Science editorial when she was chair of nutrition at New York University. “All flourish when people eat more, and all employ armies of lobbyists to discourage governments from doing anything” about it.262

If part of the problem is cheap, tasty convenience, is the solution hard-to-find food that’s unappealing and expensive? Or might there be a way to get the best of all worlds—easy, healthy, delicious, satisfying meals that help you lose weight?

I wrote this book to find out.

****************************************************************************************************
THE CONSEQUENCES
As Queasy as ABC
The largest study in history on the health effects of being overweight analyzed data from more than fifty million people in nearly two hundred countries and found that too much excess body weight accounts for the premature deaths of about four million people every year. Most of these deaths are from heart disease, but the researchers found “convincing” or “probable” evidence linking obesity to twenty different disorders263—a veritable alphabet soup of potential health concerns.

In the ABCs of health consequences, A is for arthritis. Obesity can worsen rheumatoid arthritis264 and increase the risk of another inflammatory joint disease,265 gout, known as the disease of kings thanks to their overly rich diets. The most common joint disease in the world, though, is osteoarthritis,266 and obesity may be its main modifiable risk factor.267

Osteoarthritis develops when the cushioning cartilage lining of joints breaks down faster than the body can build it back up.268 The knees are the most commonly affected, leading to the assumption that the disease’s relationship to obesity was simply the excess wear and tear from added load on the joints. Non-weight-bearing joints, like the hands and wrists, can also be affected, however, which suggests the link isn’t purely mechanical. Obesity-related dyslipidemia may be playing a role,269 with elevations in the amount of fat, cholesterol, and triglycerides in the blood aggravating inflammation in the joints.270

Losing just around a pound a year over a span of a decade may decrease the odds of developing osteoarthritis by more than 50 percent.271 Weight reduction may even obviate the need for knee replacement surgery. Within just eight weeks, obese osteoarthritis sufferers who had been randomized to lose weight improved their knee function as much as those going through surgery. Researchers concluded that losing around twenty pounds of fat “might be regarded as an alternative to knee replacement.”272

But isn’t it easier to just get your knee replaced than lose twenty pounds? Rarely discussed is the fact that nearly one in two hundred knee replacement patients dies within ninety days of surgery. Given the extreme 
popularity of the operation—about seven hundred thousand are performed each year in the United States—an orthopedics journal editor suggested that “people considering this operation are inadequately attuned to the possibility that it may kill them.”273 A surgeon responded by questioning whether patients should be told about what is arguably the “single most-salient fact”

To me, the real question is whether this knowledge will help the patient. Will it add to the anxiety of the already-anxious patient, perhaps to the point of denying that patient a helpful operation? Or will this knowledge motivate a less-handicapped patient to stick to a diet and physical activity regime? Ultimately, then, the question boils down to the surgeon’s judgment.275

Even among the vast majority who survive the surgery, approximately one in five knee replacement patients describes being unsatisfied with the outcome.276 Weight loss, on the other hand, may offer a nonsurgical alternative that instead treats the cause and offers only beneficial side effects.


B Is for Back Pain and Blood Pressure
Being overweight is also a risk factor for low back pain,277 sciatica,278 lumbar disc degeneration,279 and herniation.280 As with arthritis, this may be due to the combination of the hefty joint load plus the inflammation and cholesterol associated with being heavier.281 Autopsy studies show that the lumbar arteries that feed the spine can get clogged with atherosclerosis and starve the discs in the lower back of oxygen and nutrients.

B is also for blood pressure. Excess visceral fat can physically compress our kidneys,283 and the increased pressure can effectively squeeze sodium back into our bloodstreams, increasing our blood pressures. Together, the combination of obesity and hypertension can have “disastrous health implications.”284 Ready for some good news? Even just a few pounds of weight loss can help take off the pressure. Losing weight has been described as a “vital strategy for controlling hypertension.”285 In fact, losing around nine pounds was shown to lower blood pressures286 about as much as cutting salt intake287 approximately in half.288

How do kidneys regulate sodium levels?
The kidneys stimulate the adrenal glands to secrete the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain sodium and to excrete potassium. When sodium is retained, less urine is produced, eventually causing blood volume to increase.

****************************************************************************************************
C Is for Cancer
As many as three-quarters of people surveyed were evidently unaware of the link between obesity and cancer289 when in fact, based on a comprehensive review of a thousand studies, excess body fat raises the risk of most cancers, including esophageal, stomach, colorectal, liver, gallbladder, pancreatic, breast, uterine, ovarian, kidney, brain, thyroid, and bone marrow (multiple myeloma) cancers.290 Why? It could be due to the chronic inflammation that comes with obesity 291 or the high insulin levels due to insulin resistance.292 (Besides controlling blood sugars, insulin is a potent growth factor that can promote tumor growth.293) In women, it could also be the excess estrogen.294

After the ovaries shut down at menopause, fat takes over as the principal site of estrogen production. This is why obese women have up to nearly twice the estrogen levels circulating in their bloodstreams,295 which is associated with increased risk of developing—and dying from—breast cancer.296 A twenty-pound weight loss can reduce estrogen levels within the breast by 24 percent.

The data on prostate cancer aren’t as strong,298 though obesity is associated with increased risk of invasive penile cancer.299

One reason we’re confident the link between obesity and cancer is cause and effect, and not just an indirect consequence of eating poorly, is because when people lose weight—even just through bariatric surgery—their overall risk of cancer goes down. Those experiencing a sustained loss of about forty pounds after surgery went on to develop around one-third fewer cancers over the subsequent decade or so, compared with a nonsurgical control group of matched individuals who continued to slowly gain weight over time.300 The exception is colorectal cancer.301

****************************************************************************************************
Colorectal cancer appears to be the only malignancy for which the risk goes up after obesity surgery. After bariatric surgery, the rate of rectal cancer death may triple.302 The rearrangement of anatomy involved in one of the most common surgeries—gastric bypass—is thought to increase bile acid exposure along the intestinal lining. This causes sustained pro-inflammatory changes even years after the procedure, which are thought to be responsible for the increased cancer risk.303 In contrast, losing weight by dietary means has the potential to decrease obesity-related cancer risk across the board.


D Is for Diabetes
As laid out in a consensus statement from the International Diabetes Federation, obesity is considered the single most important risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes,304 which is now the leading cause of kidney failure, lower-limb amputations, and adult-onset blindness.305 Ironically, many of the leading drugs used to treat diabetes, including insulin itself, actually cause further weight gain, creating a vicious cycle.306 So, again, using lifestyle medicine to treat the underlying cause is not only the safest, simplest, and cheapest route but also can be the most effective.


****************************************************************************************************
E Is for Encephalopathy
Encephalopathy means brain disease, and there are consistent data linking obesity in middle age to higher risk of dementia later in life.307 Overweight individuals have about one-third higher risk, and those who are obese in midlife seem to have about 90 percent greater risk of becoming demented.308 The risk isn’t just limited to future dysfunction, though. People with excess body weight don’t appear to think as clearly at any age.

Obese individuals show broad impairments in what are called executive functions of the brain, such as working memory, decision-making, planning, cognitive flexibility, and verbal fluency.309 These play a critical role in everyday life. People may think about their obesity and the resulting stigma they experience as much as five times every hour,310 but the cognitive deficits do not appear to arise just from being distracted by these thoughts. There are actually structural brain differences between normal-weight and overweight individuals.

A review entitled “Does the Brain Shrink as the Waist Expands?” noted gray matter atrophy across all ages among those carrying excess body fat.311 This reduced brain volume correlates with the lower executive function.312 Compromised integrity of the rest of the brain, the white matter, has also been shown, which suggests accelerated brain aging even in young adults and children with obesity.313 This implies that there’s something about the obesity itself that is affecting brain 
function, rather than a later clinical consequence of corresponding conditions such as high blood pressure.314 Purported mechanisms for such executive dysfunction include inflammation and oxidative stress, both related to obesity.315

Does weight loss improve cognitive function? Based on a meta-analysis of twenty studies, mental performance across a variety of domains can be significantly improved with even modest weight loss, though no studies have yet been done to determine if this then translates into a normalization of Alzheimer’s disease risk.316


F Is for Fertility
F is for fertility, or rather failed fertility. Overweight couples struggling to have children “should be educated on the detrimental effects of fatness,” one meta-analysis concluded, as weight loss is associated with an improvement in pregnancy rates among infertile women.317 Men may also suffer impaired fertility. The heavier a man is, the greater his risk of having a low sperm count or being completely sterile.318 This in part may be because of the effects of excess body fat on testosterone levels.

Fat isn’t the primary site of estrogen production only in postmenopausal women but in men as well. There’s an enzyme in body fat that actually converts testosterone into estrogen.319 Even going from obese to just overweight could potentially raise testosterone levels in the blood of men by 13 percent.320

A more dramatic cause of infertility in obese men is called hidden penis. Also referred to in the medical literature as buried penis, concealed penis, or inconspicuous penis, it occurs when excess fat in the pubic area subsumes the male member. It’s also called 
trapped penis because the moist enfolding skin can result in a chronic inflammatory dermatitis leading to scarring and requiring surgical intervention.321 So F may also stand for Free Willy.


****************************************************************************************************
G Is for Gallstones and GERD
What is the number-one digestive reason people are hospitalized? Gallbladder attack. Every year, more than a million Americans are diagnosed with gallstones, and about seven hundred thousand have to get their gallbladders surgically removed.322 It’s a relatively safe procedure.323 Immediate complication rates tend to be under 5 percent, and the mortality rate is only about one in a thousand.324 However, 10 percent of patients may develop “post-cholecystectomy syndrome” with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms weeks or months after their gallbladders are removed.325

What are gallstones made of? In 80 to 90 percent of cases, gallstones are mostly just crystallized cholesterol, forming like rock candy in the gallbladder.326 This was used to explain why some small, earlier studies found that nonvegetarians had a higher incidence of gallstones given their higher cholesterol levels,327 but the results from larger, more recent studies are more equivocal.328,329 The biggest purported cause-and-effect risk factor330 may be obesity,331 which increases risk as much as sevenfold.332

Ironically, rapid weight loss may also be a trigger of gallbladder attacks. A half pound a day has been deemed the “upper limit for medically safe weight loss” based on gallstone formation. Ultrasound studies found that above that limit, the incidence of new stones can go from less than one in two hundred a week up to one in thirty.333 To help prevent a gallstone attack, you can increase your fiber intake. Not only is dietary fiber intake associated with less gallbladder disease,334 but those placed on high-fiber foods during a weight-loss regimen suffered significantly less gallbladder sludging than those losing the same weight without the extra fiber.335

Fiber-rich food consumption can also decrease the risk of acid reflux (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, or GERD). The excess abdominal pressure due to obesity may push up acid into the throat, causing heartburn and inflammation.336 The increased pressure on the abdominal organs associated with obesity may also explain why overweight women suffer from more vaginal prolapse,337 where organs such as the rectum push out into the vaginal cavity.

H Is for Heart Disease
Of the four million deaths attributed to excess body weight every year around the world, nearly 70 percent are due to cardiovascular disease.338 Is it just because those people had been eating poorly? Genetic studies suggest that people effectively randomized from conception to be heavier—just based on their genes—do indeed have higher rates of heart disease and stroke regardless of what they eat.339 So, if we lose weight, does our risk drop?

The SOS trial, which stands for Swedish Obese Subjects, was the first long-term controlled trial to compare the outcomes of thousands of bariatric surgery patients to matched control subjects who started out at the same weight but went the nonsurgical route. The control group maintained their weights, whereas the surgical group maintained about a 20 percent weight loss over the next ten to twenty years. Over that time, the surgical weight-loss group not only developed 80 percent less diabetes but suffered significantly fewer heart attacks and strokes, so, not surprisingly, they significantly reduced their total mortality overall.

I Is for Immunity
The SOS trial also found that those who lost weight got less cancer.341 This may be because antitumor immunity appears to be affected by weight. Natural killer cells are our immune systems’ first line of defense against cancer cells (as well as many viral infections), and their function is severely impaired by obesity. When obese individuals were randomized to a weight-loss program, there was a significant reactivation of natural killer cell function within just three months.342 However, the program involved an exercise component, so it’s hard to tease out the impact of the weight loss itself since physical activity alone can boost natural killer cell activity.343

On the other end of the spectrum, obesity is suspected to be a causal risk factor for the development of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease.344 This suggests obesity is associated with the worst of both worlds when it comes to immune function: underactivity when it comes to protecting against cancer and infection, but overactivity when it comes to certain inflammatory autoimmune conditions.

J Is for Jaundice
Thanks to the obesity epidemic, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common liver disorder in the industrialized world.346 Fat doesn’t just end up in our bellies and thighs but inside some of our internal organs. More than 80 percent of individuals with abdominal obesity may have fatty infiltration into their livers,347 and in those with severe obesity, the prevalence 
can exceed 90 percent.348 This can lead to inflammation, scarring, jaundice, and, ultimately, cirrhosis and liver cancer.349 Currently, the advanced form of NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty hepatitis, is the leading cause of liver transplants in American women, and men are expected to catch up by 2020.

K Is for Kidneys
Obesity is also one of the strongest risk factors for chronic kidney disease. Our kidneys compensate for the metabolic demands of excess weight by red-lining into what’s called hyperfiltration to deal with the extra workload. The resulting increased pressure within the kidneys can damage the sensitive organs and increase the risk of kidney failure over the long term.351

… and L, M, N, O, P Through Z
If we wanted to keep singing the alphabet of obesity-related health concerns, L could be for diminished lung function,352 M for a cluster of risk factors known as metabolic syndrome,353 and so on. There’s even an X—for xiphodynia, pain at the tip of the bottom of the breastbone from being bent outward by an expanding abdomen.

Counting the Costs
Given the myriad health conditions associated with excess weight, medical spending attributable to obesity is nearly $2,000 per person per year,355 with obese workers with multiple complications costing companies up to $10,000 more in health-care coverage compared to lean counterparts.356 Beyond just brazen discrimination, this actually may account for some of the wage gap obese employees experience as companies try to make up for 
these costs.357 Between health-care costs and diminished productivity in terms of lost workdays, the total per capita lifetime costs of long-term obesity have been estimated to exceed $200,000.358

Some estimates peg the current national cost of obesity at about $150 billion,359 with another $50 billion per year added by 2030 as our increasingly heavy baby boomers continue to age.360 The Milken Institute appraised the cost of obesity as a trillion-dollar drag on the economy,361 more than twice what we spend on national defense.362 Others diametrically disagree, based on the morbid fact that obese individuals may not live as long. Just as the medical costs of tobacco-related diseases may be more than offset by the shortened survival of smokers, the lifetime health-care costs of obese individuals may turn out to be lower because they are expected to die so much sooner.363 So the true cost may be calculated in lives rather than dollars.


****************************************************************************************************
The Obesity Paradox
The evidence that being overweight increases our risk for debilitating diseases like diabetes is considered indisputable, but, surprisingly, there is controversy surrounding body weight and overall mortality.371 In 2013, scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a meta-analysis in The Journal of the American Medical Association suggesting that being overweight was actually advantageous. Yes, grade 2 or grade 3 obesity, which is like being the average American’s height, five foot six,372 and weighing about 215 pounds or more, was associated with living a shorter life, but grade 1 obesity (about 185–215 pounds at the same height) was not. And, being overweight (155–185 pounds at average height) appeared to be protective compared to those who were normal weight (115–155 pounds at five foot six). The overweight individuals, with a BMI of 25–30, appeared to live the longest.373

Headline writers were giddy: “Being Overweight Can Extend Life,” “Dreading Your Diet? Don’t Worry … Plump People Live LONGER,”374 and “Extra Pounds Mean Lower Chance of Death.”375 Not surprisingly, the study ignited a firestorm of controversy in the public health community and was called “ludicrous,”376 “flawed,” and “misleading.”377 The chair of nutrition at Harvard lost his cool, calling it “really a pile of rubbish,”378 fearing the food industry might exploit the study in the same way the petroleum industry misuses a manufactured controversy over climate change.379

Public health advocates can’t just dismiss data they find inconvenient, though. Science is science. But how could being overweight increase the risk of life-threatening diseases, yet, at the same time, make you live longer? This became known as the obesity paradox.380 The solution to the puzzle appears to lie with two major sources of bias, the first being confounding by smoking.381

As I’ll explore in the Amping AMPK section, the nicotine in tobacco can lead to weight loss. So if you’re skinnier because you smoke, then it’s no wonder you’d live a shorter life with a slimmer waist. The failure to control for the effect of smoking in studies purporting to show an “obesity paradox” leads to the dangers of obesity being “grossly underestimated.”382

The second major source of bias is reverse causality. Instead of lower weight leading to life-threatening diseases, isn’t it more likely that life-threatening diseases lead to lower weight? Conditions such as hidden tumors, chronic heart or lung disease, alcoholism, and depression can all cause unintentional weight loss months or even years before a diagnosis is made.383 As we’ve discussed, it’s become normal to be overweight in this country.384 People who are “abnormally” thin—that is, at an ideal weight—could actually be taking care of themselves, but they also may be heavy smokers, elderly and frail, or seriously ill with weight loss from their disease.

Deadweight
To put the obesity paradox issue to the test once and for all, the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration was formed, reviewing data from more than ten million people from hundreds of studies in dozens of countries—the largest evaluation of BMI and mortality in history.386 To help eliminate bias, the researchers omitted smokers and those with known chronic disease. They then excluded the first five years of follow-up to try to remove from the analysis those with undiagnosed conditions who had lost weight due to an impending death. The results were clear: Being overweight or any grade of obesity was associated with a significantly greater risk of dying prematurely.387 In fact, adjusting for those biases leads to “eliminating the obesity paradox altogether.”388 In other words, the so-called obesity paradox appears to be just a myth.389

Indeed, when intentional weight loss is actually put to the test, people live longer. Bariatric surgery studies like the SOS trial show weight loss reduces long-term mortality,390 and randomizing people to lose weight through lifestyle changes shows the same.391 Losing a dozen pounds through diet and exercise was found to be associated with a 15 percent drop in overall mortality risk. Exercise alone may extend life span even without weight loss,392 but there also appears to be a similar longevity benefit of weight loss through dietary means alone.

****************************************************************************************************
Hating Their Guts
The size-acceptance movement is definitely right about one thing, though: the extraordinary scourge of weight stigma. Described as the last “acceptable” form of bias,412 weight stigma is the rampant discrimination and stereotyping of overweight individuals. Fifty overweight women were asked to keep a diary of all the times they felt they were stigmatized for their weights. Over just one week, more than a thousand instances were recorded.413 An overweight woman may expect to be harassed (such as called names or insulted), encounter physical barriers (like being unable to fit into public seats), or be discriminated against (such as receiving perceived poorer service at restaurants or stores) on average about three times a day. Obese men report three times less discrimination than women of the same size,414 so it may be only a daily occurrence for them.

This weight stigma starts surprisingly early. Children as young as three years old label overweight peers as “mean,” “stupid,” “lazy,” and “ugly.”415 One of the most poignant illustrations comes from a famous study published in 1961. Children in summer camps and schools across a swath of different social, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds in California, Montana, and New York were asked to rank the following images as to whom they liked best a child in crutches with one leg in a brace
a child in a wheelchair
a child with one hand missing
a facially disfigured child
an obese child
In every population of kids they tested, there was “remarkable uniformity.”416 The obese child always came in dead last.

But that was ages ago. What happened when the original study was repeated? Researchers published the forty-year follow-up in 2003, and guess what they found? The title of the study gives it away: “Getting Worse: The Stigmatization of Obese Children.” The obese child was liked even less.417 This parallels trends throughout society with a 70 percent jump in perceived weight discrimination recorded in national surveys since the mid-1990s.418

Attitudes among educators may not be helping. More than a quarter of teachers and other school staff surveyed felt that becoming obese is “one of the worst things that could happen to a person.”419 Even parents can be biased, providing less support for college for their overweight daughters compared to thinner siblings.420 As two prominent obesity researchers commented, “It is strong prejudice indeed when parents discriminate against their own children.”421

What about doctors? One representative national survey found that more than half of physicians viewed obese patients as “awkward, unattractive, ugly, and noncompliant.”422 About a quarter of nurses agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “Caring for an obese patient usually repulses me.”423 This antagonism can have 
serious health consequences for those who may need care the most. For example, obese women are at higher risk for developing cervical,424 endometrial, and ovarian cancers,425 yet they are less likely to be screened. Morbidly obese patients only have about half the odds of getting their recommended pelvic exams.426 Though some of this may be avoidance on the part of the patient, some doctors just turn away obese patients. The Sun Sentinel polled OB-GYN practices in Florida and found that as many as one in seven refused to see heavier women, for example, setting weight cutoffs for new patients starting at two hundred pounds.427

Even doctors who welcome obese patients have been found to give them short shrift. Physicians randomized to receive a medical chart of a migraine patient who either presented as average weight or obese said they would give the obese patient about 28 percent less of their time428—and it’s less quality time too. Recorded doctor visits found physicians tend to build less emotional rapport with overweight patients.429

At least the doctors appear able to hide their disdain. In a study entitled “Obese Patients Overestimate Physicians’ Attitudes of Respect,” despite the negative attitudes doctors harbored toward their obese patients, the same patients expressed their satisfaction with their providers. The researchers concluded, “While physicians may be successfully playing the part, the lack of true respect suggests … the authenticity of the patient–physician relationship should be questioned.”


For Shame
Weight stigma may perpetuate a cycle of stress leading to obesity, leading to even more stress. I discuss this 
concept further in the Stress Hormone Relief section. Across thousands of individuals followed for four years, those reporting discriminatory experiences had more than twice the odds of becoming obese. As well, those who started out obese had more than three times the odds of staying that way compared to people who started out at the same weight but didn’t experience discrimination.431 This could be from stress-induced eating on one side of the calorie-balance equation or stigma-induced exercise avoidance on the other.

Obese individuals with more frequent experiences with weight stigma report greater avoidance of exercising in public, feeling judged and embarrassed.432 These “too fat to exercise”433 fears may be well grounded. Strong anti-fat biases have been documented in both fitness professionals and regular gym-goers,434 which may present an unwelcoming environment in fitness centers and health clubs.435

Whichever side of the calorie equation gets tipped, those who experience weight stigma can end up suffering health consequences independent of any added weight. Those reporting more frequent fat prejudice exhibit higher levels of depression,436 inflammation,437 and oxidative stress,438 as well as shorter life spans. Two studies following a total of nearly twenty thousand people both found about a 50 percent increase in mortality risk among those reporting greater daily discrimination.439 Despite these hazards, some scholars advocate for even more fat shaming.

The president emeritus of the prestigious Hastings Center infamously advocated for “a kind of stigmatization lite,” using social pressures to compel people to lose weight without resorting to outright discrimination. After all, he argued, what else has the potential to counter the persuasive force of the billions spent in advertising every year by the food and beverage industry? It worked against tobacco. He recalls his own battle with addiction: “The force of being shamed and beat upon socially was as persuasive for me to stop smoking as the threats to my health.” The public health campaign to stigmatize cigarettes turned what had been considered “simply a bad habit into reprehensible behavior.”440

When such campaigns have been tried, they have been met with fierce resistance. Georgia’s Strong4Life campaign featured billboards of morose-looking obese children with such captions as “Warning: Chubby kids may not outlive their parents” and “It’s hard to be a little girl when you’re not.”441 The campaign sponsors defended the ads as an attempt to break through the denial in a state with some of the highest recorded childhood obesity rates442—but it’s only defensible if it works.

So does it? Being labeled “too fat” in childhood was associated with a higher risk of becoming obese compared to children who weighed the same but were never told that.443 Does this mean we should just ignore the elephant in the room? Many doctors apparently think so.

Just as veterinarians have been found to be reluctant to tell people their pets are obese,444 many pediatricians are similarly quiet when it comes to discussing weight concerns with parents. Less than a quarter of parents of overweight children report having been told that about their children’s weight status by their pediatricians.445 One might think it would be obvious, but a Gallup survey found that parents appear to be “notoriously poor judges of their children’s weight.” Similarly, despite skyrocketing obesity, the percentage of adults who describe themselves as overweight has remained essentially unchanged over the past few decades. All this, Gallup concluded, helps “paint a picture of mass delusion in the United States about its rising weight.”446

I think patients have the right to be informed. Those told by their doctors that they are overweight have nearly four times the odds of attempting weight loss447 and about twice the odds of succeeding.448 Just as physicians who smoke are less likely to challenge their patients who smoke, overweight physicians are less likely to bring up the subject of weight loss449 or even document obesity in patient charts.450 Ironically, overweight patients trust diet advice more from overweight doctors than those who are normal weight.451

As obesity rates have gone up, the rate of weight counseling advice from primary care physicians has inexplicably gone down.452 Even when they do manage to counsel patients, doctors appear to have little to offer in terms of specifics. Fewer than half who were surveyed said they provide specific guidance to their patients.453 Just telling patients Watch what you eat, is unlikely to be particularly helpful, but many primary care physicians may not even go that far. Physical inactivity was rated by physicians as significantly more important than any other cause of obesity, which is far from accurate, as I discuss here. Most physicians said they would spend more time working with patients on weight management if only their time were “reimbursed appropriately.”454 Maybe we could even offer doctors a bonus to refrain from blaming the victim.455 As one pair of commentators wrote in response to the pro-stigmatization camp, “If shaming reduced obesity, there would be no fat people.”


****************************************************************************************************
Blind, Deaf, Dumb, or Fat
I want to end this stigma section with the jaw-dropping findings of a study I think best illustrates how hard it is to live inside a fat body. If this doesn’t foster sympathy among my medical colleagues, I don’t know what will. Researchers talked with men and women who had lost and kept off more than 100 pounds to tap into their unique insights, having personally experienced what it was like to be morbidly obese and then, on average, 126 pounds lighter. Forty-seven such individuals were interviewed.

They were asked to think back to when they were heavier and make a choice: “If someone offered you a couple of million dollars if you stayed morbidly obese forever, would you have chosen the money? Or would you have chosen to be normal weight no matter what?”

Option 1: “I would have chosen no money and being normal weight. It would have taken me one second to decide.”
Option 2: “I probably would have chosen being normal weight. But the possibility of having that much money would make me think about the choice.”
Option 3: “I wanted to be normal weight, but I really could use the money. If I would be a multimillionaire I think I could live with being morbidly obese.”
One of the forty-seven people had to think about it, but the other forty-six jumped at Option 1. Not a single person chose Option 3. They all said they would give up being a multimillionaire to be normal weight.

If that shocked you, buckle your seat belt. They were then asked about being obese compared to other disabilities. Normally when you ask people to choose between living with their own disability or switching to a different one, there is a strong proclivity to stay with their own.458 For example, even though most people would rather be deaf than blind, blind people prefer to remain blind by a large margin rather than having sight without sound. They already know how to cope with their own disability, so there’s safety in familiarity. The exact opposite happened when the formerly obese were asked.

Each of the forty-seven men and women said they’d rather be deaf for the rest of their lives than obese. Every single one said they’d rather be unable to read, be diabetic, have very bad acne, or have heart disease than be obese. And then the true jaw-dropper: More than 90 percent said they’d rather have a leg amputated, and, similarly, about nine out of ten said they’d rather be blind their whole lives than obese. Obesity appears to be the only handicap where nearly everyone wants to switch disabilities no matter what the cost. To quote one study subject, “When you’re blind, people want to help you. No one wants to help when you’re fat.”


What About Weight Cycling?
There was a book originally published in the 1980s and then repeatedly republished ever since entitled Dieting Makes You Fat. Since most people who lose weight go on to regain it, the concern is there may be adverse health effects to so-called yo-yo dieting.467 This idea emerged from animal studies468 that showed, for example, detrimental effects of starving and refeeding obese rats.469 This captured the media’s attention, leading to a pervasive common belief about the “dangers” of weight cycling, discouraging people from even trying.470

Even the animal data are inconclusive, though. For example, weight cycling mice makes them live longer.471 Most importantly, other than perhaps a greater risk of gallstones,472,473 a review of the human data concluded that “evidence for an adverse effect of weight cycling appears sparse, if it exists at all.”474 In fact, as I write this, the current issue of Obesity, the official journal of the leading scientific society dedicated to the field, published a commentary entitled “Yo-Yo Dieting Is Better Than None.”

Under the Knife
What about bringing a scalpel to the gunfight instead? The use of bariatric surgery has exploded from about forty thousand procedures per year, as noted in the first international survey in 1998,532 to hundreds of thousands now performed each year in the United States alone.533 The first technique developed, the intestinal bypass, involved carving out about twenty feet of intestines.534,535 More than thirty thousand intestinal bypass operations were performed536 before the “catastrophic,”537 “disastrous outcomes” were recognized.538 This included protein deficiency–induced liver disease539 progressing to “fatal hepatic necrosis.”540 Its inauspicious start is remembered as “one of the dark blots in the history of surgery.”541

Today, death rates after bariatric surgery are considered “very low,” occurring on average in perhaps one in three hundred542 to one in five hundred patients.543 The most common procedure is stomach stapling, also known as a sleeve gastrectomy, in which most of the stomach is permanently removed,544 leaving only a narrow sleeve or tube of stomach so as to restrict how much food people can eat at any one time.545 It’s ironic that many patients choose bariatric surgery, convinced that “diets don’t work” for them, when, in reality, that’s all the surgery may be—an enforced diet.546 Bariatric surgery can be thought of as a form of internal jaw wiring.

Gastric bypass is the second most common bariatric surgery.547 It combines restriction—stapling the stomach into a pouch smaller than the size of a golf ball—with malabsorption, by rearranging our anatomy to bypass the first part of our small intestines.548 It appears to be more effective than just cutting out most of the stomach—resulting in a loss of 63 percent of excess weight compared to 53 percent with a gastric sleeve549—but gastric bypass carries a greater risk of serious complications.550 Many are surprised to learn that new surgical procedures don’t require premarket testing or approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)551 and are largely exempt from rigorous regulatory scrutiny,552 potentially making new surgeries even riskier than new medications.


It’s Complicated
The third most common bariatric procedure is a revision to fix a previous bariatric procedure.553 Up to 25 percent of bariatric patients have to go back into the operating room to rectify problems caused by their first bariatric surgery or for additional procedures. Reoperations are riskier, carrying up to ten times the mortality rate,554 and offer no guarantee of success.555 Complications include leaks,556 fistulas, ulcers, strictures, erosions, obstructions, and severe acid reflux.557

The extent of risk may depend on the skill of the surgeon. In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, bariatric surgeons voluntarily submitted videos of themselves performing surgery to a panel of their peers for evaluation. Technical proficiency varied widely and was related to the rates of complications, hospital readmissions, reoperations, and death. Patients operated on by the less competent surgeons suffered nearly three times the complications and five times the risk of death.558

As with athletes and musicians, some surgeons may simply be more talented than others, but practice may help make perfect.559 Gastric bypass is such a complicated procedure that its learning curve may require hundreds of cases for a surgeon to master it. Risk of complications plateaus after about five hundred cases, with the lowest risk found among surgeons who’ve performed more than six hundred bypasses.560 So if you do choose to undergo the procedure, I’d recommend asking your surgeon how many they’ve done and also choosing an accredited Bariatric Center of Excellence, since surgical mortality appears to be two to three times lower at those institutions than at nonaccredited ones.561

****************************************************************************************************
Even if the surgery goes perfectly, lifelong nutritional replacement and monitoring are required to avoid vitamin and mineral deficits562—the consequences of which include more than just a little anemia, osteoporosis, or hair loss.563 Bariatric surgeries have resulted in full-blown cases of potentially life-threatening deficiencies, such as beriberi, pellagra, kwashiorkor, and nerve damage564 that can manifest as vision loss years or even decades after surgery (in the case of copper deficiency).565 Tragically, in cases of severe deficiency of a B vitamin called thiamine, nearly one in three patients progressed to permanent brain damage before they were even diagnosed.566

The malabsorption of nutrients is on purpose for procedures like gastric bypass. By cutting out segments of the intestine, we can successfully impair the absorption of calories—but at the expense of impairing the absorption of necessary nutrition. Even people who simply undergo restrictive procedures like stomach stapling can be at risk for life-threatening nutrient deficiencies because of persistent vomiting.567 Indeed, vomiting is reported by up to 60 percent of patients after bariatric surgery due to “inappropriate” eating behaviors—that is, by trying to eat normally.568

“Dumping syndrome” can work the same way. A large percentage of gastric bypass patients can suffer from abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea, bloating, fatigue, or palpitations after eating calorie-rich foods as they bypass the stomach and dump straight into the intestines. As surgeons describe it, this is a feature, not a bug: “Dumping syndrome is an expected and desired part of the behavior modification caused by gastric bypass surgery; it can deter patients from consuming energy-dense food.”569

****************************************************************************************************
Bariatric Surgery: Metabolic or Hyperbolic?
The surgical community objects to the characterization of bariatric surgery as internal jaw wiring, the cutting up of healthy organs just to discipline people’s behavior. The field has gone as far as to rename it “metabolic surgery,” suggesting the anatomical rearrangements cause changes in digestive hormones that offer unique physiological benefits.570 As evidence, the surgical community points to the remarkable remission rates for type 2 diabetes.

After bariatric surgery, about 55 percent of obese diabetics and 75 percent of “super-obese” diabetics go into remission, meaning they have normal blood sugars off all diabetes medications.571 The normalization in blood sugars can happen within just days after the surgery.572 Fifteen years after surgery, 30 percent may remain diabetes-free (compared to a 7 percent cure rate in a nonsurgical control group).573 But are we sure it was the surgery that did this? Could their improvement in blood sugars just be from the extreme caloric restriction that typically precedes and also follows surgery, rather than some surgical sort of metabolic magic? Researchers decided to put it to the test.

At a bariatric surgery clinic at the University of Texas, patients with type 2 diabetes scheduled for a gastric bypass volunteered to first undergo an identical period of caloric restriction. They were placed in the hospital and, for ten days, were put on the same diet they would be on immediately before and after the surgery, averaging fewer than five hundred calories a day to mimic the surgical situation. The researchers then waited a few months so the subjects would gain back the weight before putting them through the actual surgery, matched day for day to the diets they had been on before. Same patients, same diets—just with or without the actual surgery. If there were some sort of metabolic benefit to the anatomical rearrangement, they would have done better with the actual surgery, but in some ways, they actually did worse. The caloric restriction alone resulted in similar improvements in blood sugar, pancreatic function, and insulin sensitivity, but several measures of diabetic control improved significantly more without the surgery.574 So, if anything, the surgery seemed to put them at a metabolic disadvantage.

The bottom line is that type 2 diabetes is reversible with weight loss if you catch it early enough. With the loss of 15 percent of body weight, nearly 90 percent of those who’ve had type 2 diabetes for fewer than four years can achieve remission, whereas it may only be reversible in 50 percent of those who’ve lived with the disease for longer than eight years.575 That’s losing weight with diet alone, though. The remission numbers for diabetics losing more than twice as much weight with bariatric surgery may only be around 62 percent and 26 percent, respectively.576 So losing weight with your fork can be more than twice as effective as the surgeons’ knives.

Losing weight without resorting to surgery may offer other benefits as well. In the Anti-Inflammatory section, I’ll discuss the slimming hormone leptin. Losing weight with diet alone can improve leptin sensitivity,577 but losing weight from gastric bypass apparently does not.578 Diabetics losing weight with diet alone can also improve markers of systemic inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor, whereas levels significantly worsened when about the same amount of weight was lost from a gastric bypass.

****************************************************************************************************
The Blind Leading the Blind
What about diabetic complications? Two of the reasons we don’t want diabetes are that we don’t want to go blind and we don’t want to go on dialysis. Reversing diabetes with bariatric surgery can improve kidney function580 but, surprisingly, may not prevent the appearance581 or progression of diabetic vision loss.582 Perhaps this is because bariatric surgery affects diet quantity but not necessarily diet quality. This reminds me of a famous study published in The New England Journal of Medicine that randomized thousands of diabetics to an intensive lifestyle program that focused on weight loss. Ten years in, the study was stopped prematurely because the diabetics weren’t living any longer or having any fewer heart attacks.583 This may be because they remained on the same heart-clogging diet, but just with smaller portions.

There is a diet that has been shown to reverse diabetic eye disease: Dr. Kempner’s rice and fruit diet. More than a half century ago, Walter Kempner at Duke University showed that his plant-based diet, ultralow in sodium, fat, cholesterol, and animal protein, could not only reverse advanced heart and kidney failure584 but diabetic retinopathy as well, with some patients going from not even being able to read headlines to having normal vision.585

How do we treat severe diabetic retinopathy these days? With intravitreal drugs (meaning injections straight into your eyeball). If those don’t work, there’s always panretinal laser photocoagulation, in which laser burns are etched over nearly the entire back of your eye586 in the hope that the little pieces left behind may get more of the blood flow.587 When I see this, along with Kempner’s work, I can’t help but feel like history has been reversed. It would be one thing if, a half century ago, the best we had was a barbaric burn-out-your-eye-socket surgery but, thankfully, we’ve since learned that we can reverse the vision loss through dietary means alone. But instead of learning, medicine seems to have forgotten.

Kempner also proved massive obesity could be corrected “without drastic intervention,” showing people could lose hundreds of pounds through lifestyle changes alone, without resorting to hospitalization, drugs, or surgery.588 His diet was itself pretty drastic (certainly not to be undertaken without medical supervision),589 but at least it didn’t entail getting one’s internal organs cut open and stapled. “Even if surgery proves sustainably effective,” wrote the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, “the need to rely on the rearrangement of natural gastrointestinal anatomy as an alternative to better use of feet and forks [exercise and diet] seems a societal travesty.”


****************************************************************************************************
Through Thick and Thin
How sustainable is weight loss with bariatric surgery? Over the first year or two after the procedure, most gastric bypass patients do end up regaining some of the weight they had lost,591 but five years later, three-quarters maintain at least a 20 percent weight loss.592 The typical trajectory for someone who starts out obese at 285 pounds, for example, would be to drop to an overweight 178 pounds two years after bariatric surgery but then regain back up to an obese 207 pounds.593 This has been chalked up to “grazing” behavior, where compulsive eaters may shift from bingeing, which becomes more difficult post-surgery, to constantly eating smaller amounts throughout the day.594 Eight years out, about half of gastric bypass patients continue to describe episodes of disordered eating.595 As one pediatric obesity specialist described, “I have seen many patients who put chocolate bars into a blender with some cream, just to pass technically installed obstacles” such as a gastric band.596

Bariatric surgery advertisements are filled with happily-ever-after fairy-tale narratives of cherry-picked outcomes, offering, as one ad analysis put it, “the full Cinderella-romance happy ending.”597 This may contribute to the finding that patients often overestimate the amount of weight they’re going to lose and underestimate the difficulty of the recovery process.598 Surgery forces profound changes in eating habits, requiring slow, small, thoroughly chewed bites. The stomach goes from the volume of two softballs down to about the size of half a tennis ball in stomach stapling and about half a Ping-Pong ball in the case of gastric bypass or banding.599

As you can imagine, weight regain after surgery can have devastating psychological effects, as patients may feel they failed their last resort.600 This could help explain why bariatric surgery patients are at a higher risk of depression601 and suicide.602 Severe obesity alone may increase risk of suicidal depression,603 but even at the same weight, those going through surgery appear to be at higher risk.604 At the same BMI, age, and gender, bariatric surgery recipients have about four times the odds of suicide.605 Most convincingly, before-and-after “mirror-image analysis” shows the risk of serious self-harm increases post-surgery in the same individuals.606

Nearly one in fifty bariatric surgery patients ends up being hospitalized for self-harm or attempted suicide.607 Furthermore, this only includes confirmed self-harm episodes, excluding masked attempts608 such as overdoses of “undetermined intention.”609 Bariatric surgery patients also have an elevated risk of “accidental death,”610 though some of this may be due to changes in alcohol metabolism. When gastric bypass patients have two shots of vodka, for example, because of their altered anatomy, their blood alcohol levels shoot up past the legal driving limit within minutes.611 It’s unclear, however, whether this plays a role in the 25 percent increase in prevalence of alcohol problems noted during the second postoperative year.612

Even those who successfully lose the excess weight and keep it off appear to have a hard time coping. Ten years out, though health-related quality of life improves, general mental health tends to significantly deteriorate compared to presurgery levels—even among the biggest losers.613 Ironically, there’s a common notion that bariatric surgery is for “cheaters”614 who take the “easy way” out by choosing the “low-effort” method of weight loss.615 Shedding the pounds may not shed the stigma of even prior obesity. Studies suggest that, in the eyes of others, knowing someone was fat in the past leads them to always be treated more like a fat person. And there’s a strong anti-surgery bias on top of that, such that those who choose the scalpel to lose weight are rated most negatively (for example, thought of as least physically attractive).616 One can imagine how remaining a target of prejudice even after joining the “in-group” could potentially undercut psychological well-being.


****************************************************************************************************
Alli (orlistat) is the final choice. That’s the drug that blocks fat absorption and causes side effects such as “flatus with discharge.”689 The drug evidently “forces the patient to use diapers and to know the location of all the bathrooms in the neighborhood in an attempt to limit the consequences of urgent leakage of oily fecal matter.”690 A Freedom of Information Act exposé found that although company-sponsored studies claimed “all adverse events were recorded,”691 one trial apparently conveniently failed to mention 1,318 of them.

Studies show many doctors tend to overestimate the amount of weight loss caused by these drugs.697 One reason may be that some clinical practice guidelines, like those of the Endocrine Society, go out of their way to advocate pharmacotherapy for obesity.698 Are they seriously recommending drugging 40 percent of Americans—more than one hundred million people? 699 At this point, you will not be surprised to learn that the principal author of the guidelines had a “significant financial interest or leadership position” in six separate pharmaceutical companies that all, coincidentally, work on obesity drugs.700 In contrast, independent expert panels, like the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, explicitly recommend against weight-loss drugs given their poor track records of safety and efficacy.

****************************************************************************************************
Weight-Loss Supplements
Bad Manufacturing Practices
According to a national survey, a third of adults who’ve made serious efforts at weight loss have tried using dietary supplements,702 for which Americans spend literally billions of dollars every year.703 Most people surveyed mistakenly thought that over-the-counter appetite suppressants, herbal products, and weight-loss supplements had to be approved for safety by a government agency like the FDA before being sold to the public—or at least include some kind of warning on the label about potential side effects. Nearly half even thought they had to demonstrate some sort of effectiveness.704 None of that is true.

The FDA estimates that dietary supplements in general cause fifty thousand adverse events annually,705 most commonly liver and kidney damage.706 Meanwhile, prescription drugs don’t just adversely affect but actually kill more than one hundred thousand Americans every year.707 But at least with prescription meds, you notionally have the opportunity to parse out the risks versus the benefits, thanks to testing and monitoring requirements typically involving thousands of individuals.708 When the manufacturer of the ephedrine-containing dietary supplement Metabolife 356 had it tested in a study that ended up with just twenty-four people, only minor side effects were found (like dry mouth, headache, and insomnia).709 However, once unleashed on the populace, nearly fifteen thousand adverse effects were reported before it was pulled from the market, including heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and deaths.710

Given the lack of government oversight, there’s no guarantee that what’s on the label is even inside the bottle. FDA inspectors have found that 70 percent of supplement manufacturers violated so-called Good Manufacturing Practices, which are considered the minimum quality standards,711 such as basic sanitation and ingredient identification. Not 7 percent, but 70 percent.

DNA testing of herbal supplements across North America found that most could not be authenticated. In 68 percent of the supplements tested, the main labeled ingredient was missing completely and substituted with something else. For example, a “St. John’s Wort” supplement contained nothing but senna,712 a laxative that can cause anal blistering.713 Only two out of twelve supplement companies had products that were accurately labeled.714

The problem isn’t limited just to fly-by-night phonies in some dark corner of the internet. The New York State Attorney General commissioned DNA testing of seventy-eight bottles of commercial herbal supplements sold by Walgreens, Walmart, Target, and GNC. Four out of five bottles didn’t contain any of the herbs listed on their labels. Instead, capsules were often stuffed with little more than cheap fillers like powdered rice “and houseplants.”715


Getting More Than You Paid For
Weight-loss supplements are also infamous for being adulterated with drugs.716 Of 160 “100% natural” weight-loss supplements sampled, more than half were tainted with drugs, ranging from antidepressants to erectile dysfunction meds.717 Diuretic drugs are frequent contaminants, which makes sense.718 In the Intermittent Fasting section, I talk about rapid water loss as the billion-dollar gimmick that has sold low-carb diets for more than a century.

Researchers in Denver tested every weight-loss supplement they could find within a ten-mile radius and alarmingly found a third were adulterated with banned ingredients, and 90 percent contained “discouraged-use” components.719 The most common illegal adulterant of weight-loss supplements is sibutramine, the Meridia drug that was yanked off the market back in 2010 for heart attack and stroke risk,720 and is now blamed for cases of slimming supplement–induced psychosis.721 An analysis of weight-loss supplements bought off the internet and advertised with claims such as “purely natural,” “harmless,” or “traditional herbal” found that a third contained a high dose of sibutramine and the rest contained caffeine. Wouldn’t we be able to tell if caffeine were added to a supplement? Perhaps not if the supplement also contained temazepam, a controlled-substance benzodiazepine downer sedative found in half of the caffeine-tainted supplements.722

Doesn’t the FDA demand recalls of adulterated supplements? Yes, but the pills just pop up again on store shelves. Twenty-seven supplements purchased at least six months after recalls were retested, and two-thirds still contained banned substances. At the follow-up testing, seventeen supplements out of twenty-seven had the same pharmaceutical adulterant found originally, and six contained one or more additional banned ingredients.723 And unfortunately, the manufacturers aren’t sufficiently penalized for noncompliance. As a founding fellow of the Institute for Science in Medicine put it, “Fines for violations are small compared to the profits.

****************************************************************************************************
Slim Pickings
One of the ways supplement makers can skirt the law is by labeling them “not intended for human consumption,” for example, labeling the fatal fat-burner DNP as an industrial or research chemical.725 That’s how designer street drugs can be sold openly at gas stations and convenience stores as “bath salts.”726 Another way is to claim that synthetic stimulants added to slimming supplements are actually natural food constituents, like listing the designer drug dimethylamylamine as “geranium oil extract.” The FDA banned dimethylamylamine in 2012 after it was determined DMAA was “not found in geraniums.” (Who eats geraniums anyway?727) Despite being tentatively tied to cases of sudden death728 and hemorrhagic stroke,729 DMAA has continued to be found in weight-loss supplements with innocuous names like Simply Skinny Pollen made by Bee Fit with Trish.730

There is little doubt that certain banned supplements like ephedra could help people lose weight.731 “There’s only one problem,” wrote a founding member of the American Board of Integrative Medicine. “This supplement may kill you.”732

Are there any safe and effective dietary supplements for weight loss? When nine popular slimming supplements were put to the test in a randomized placebo-controlled trial, not a single one could beat out placebo sugar pills.733 A systematic review of diet pills came to a similar conclusion: None appears to generate appreciable impacts on body weight without undue risks.734 One such systematic review of “nutraceutical” supplements out of the Weight Management Center at Johns Hopkins University ended with this:

In closing, it is fitting to highlight that perhaps the most general and safest alternative/herbal approach to weight control is to substitute low–energy density foods for high–energy density and processed foods, thereby reducing total energy intake. By taking advantage of the low–energy density and health-promoting effects of plant-based foods, one may be able to achieve weight loss, or at least assist weight maintenance without cutting down on the volume of food consumed or compromising its nutrient value.


****************************************************************************************************
Licensed to Swill

Even if harmless, there’s a way weight-loss supplements could actually make you gain weight, thanks to a fascinating glitch of human psychology called self-licensing.736 This is when we unwittingly justify doing something that pulls us away from our goals, right after we’ve done something that moves us toward them. We reward ourselves with an indulgence that sets us back.

When smokers were told they were given “vitamin C” supplements, they subsequently smoked more cigarettes than if they had been given what were identified as “placebo” pills—even though both groups had been given identical sugar pills. The “vitamin C” group smoked nearly twice as much, perhaps thinking at some subconscious level that since they had just done something good for their health by taking a “supplement,” they could afford to “live a little,” when, in effect, it may have indeed occasioned them to live a little … less.737

You can see how self-licensing can translate into other lifestyle arenas. Other studies have shown that those given placebo pills they believed to be dietary supplements not only expressed less desire to subsequently engage in exercise but followed through by walking about a third less. Compared to those who were told the pills were placebos, misled participants were also more likely to choose a buffet over a “healthful, organic meal.”738 Would they eat more too? A seminal study entitled “The Liberating Effect of Weight Loss Supplements on Dietary Control” put it to the test.

Participants were randomized to take a known placebo or a purported weight-loss supplement that was actually just the same placebo, and they were later covertly observed at a buffet. Not only did the “supplement” subjects eat more foods, they chose less-healthy items.739 They also ate about 30 percent more candy in a bogus “taste test” and ordered more sugary drinks.740 “Hence,” the investigators concluded, “people who rely on dietary supplements for health protection may pay a hidden price: the curse of licensed self-indulgence.”


****************************************************************************************************
Policy Approaches
System Failure
The public health community appears to have all but given up on ending the obesity epidemic. The latest World Health Organization goals include a 2025 obesity target of just trying to shoot for a zero increase in further prevalence.742 Even such a modest-sounding low bar may represent one of the greatest challenges facing global health. Though there have been isolated pockets of patchy progress, no country has yet reversed the epidemic.

The promotion of the overconsumption of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages has been identified as the major driver of the obesity pandemic.743 Now that we have rid much of the world of pestilence and famine, some public health proponents have gone as far as to suggest that the “new vectors of disease” are taking the form of “trans-national food corporations that market salt, fat, sugar, and calories in unprecedented quantities.”744 Blame has been laid at the feet of lobbying efforts of the food industry,745 which is considered the world’s biggest industry.746 The processed food makers alone may bring in trillions.747 “Put simply,” concluded a senior director at the George Institute for Global Health, “the enormous commercial success enjoyed by the food industry is now causing what promises to be one of the greatest public health disasters of our time.”748

But remember—corporations just do what they’re set up to do. Their goal is not to make people fat but to make people money.749 The food industry manipulates ingredients like salt, sugar, and fat and throws in caffeine and flavor-enhancing chemicals for reasons no more nefarious than maximizing profits. Markets often incentivize companies to cater to, and take advantage of, human weaknesses.750 The food and beverage CEOs simply have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize quarterly profits for their shareholders.

But why not sell apples instead of Apple Jacks or oranges instead of Orange Crush? To quote from Slick Willie Sutton’s apocryphal answer to why he robbed banks: “That’s where the money is.” The reason some of the unhealthiest foods are marketed is one of simple economics: Real food goes bad.751 Fruits and vegetables are perishable. What shareholders want is a snack cake that lasts for weeks on the shelf.

On top of that, real food doesn’t have brand names. Why would a broccoli grower put an ad on TV when you’d just as likely buy their competitor’s broccoli? The system is simply not set up to reward the sale of health-promoting food.

And finally, real food costs money to grow. Shareholders don’t want dirt—they want dirt-cheap commodities such as corn syrup, preferably discounted by taxpayer subsidies, that they can then mix with carbonated water and sell for a few bucks a bottle. Burgers on the Dollar Menu are there thanks in part to hundreds of billions of dollars of federal subsidies for cheap animal feed.752 Those who resist calls for “heavy-handed” government regulation may not realize those heavy hands are already pressing down the scale on the side of Big Business.

//
Using the Anti-Tobacco Playbook
What we learned from the tobacco experience, wrote two preeminent public health scholars, is how powerfully profits can motivate “even at the cost of millions of lives and unspeakable suffering.” Here they quote a U.S. district judge ruling on a tobacco case:

All too often in the choice between the physical health of consumers and the financial well-being of business, concealment is chosen over disclosure, sales over safety, and money over morality. Who are these persons who knowingly and secretly decide to put the buying public at risk solely for the purpose of making profits, and who believe that illness and death of consumers is an apparent cost of their own prosperity?753

Tobacco is one of our great public health victories. The share of adults who smoke declined from 42 percent in 1965754 down to just 15 percent today.755 That’s about five out of twelve down to fewer than two out of twelve. Thanks to the decline, cigarettes now only kill about a half million Americans a year, whereas our diets kill many thousands more. Currently, the leading cause of death in America is the American diet.756

Might we be able to use the same strategies that were so successful in the battle against Big Tobacco? It may be no coincidence that three of the most cost-effective policy interventions against obesity seem to be taken straight from the tobacco wars: (1) taxes on unhealthy products, (2) front-of-pack labeling, and (3) a restriction on advertising to children.


****************************************************************************************************
Truth in Advertising
A tried-and-true method used by alcohol, tobacco, and food-related corporate interests to deflect attention away from health is to reframe something like a fat tax or soda tax as an issue of freedom, railing against the “nanny state” for restricting consumers’ rights.793 However, those complaining about the governmental manipulation of people’s choices hypocritically tend to be fine with corporations doing the very same thing.794 Case in point: former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg’s attempt to cap soft drink sizes. How dare he try to manipulate consumer choice! But isn’t that just what the industry’s done? In 1950, a twelve-ounce soda was the “king-sized” option.795 Today, it’s marketed as a child’s portion. “King-sized” became “kid-sized.”

The tobacco industry’s classic “personal responsibility” trope does have a certain philosophical appeal.796 As long as people understand the risks, shouldn’t they be free to do whatever they want with their bodies? Sure, risk-taking affects others, but if you have the right to put your own life at risk, shouldn’t you have the right to aggrieve your parents, widow your spouse, and orphan your children?797 There is a social cost argument: People’s bad decisions can cost society as a whole, and our tax dollars may have to care for them. As some health law scholars eloquently put it, “The independent individualist [motorcyclist], helmetless and free on the open road, becomes the most dependent of individuals in the spinal injury ward.”798

For the sake of argument, though, let’s forget these spillover effects. If someone understands the hazards, shouldn’t they be able to do as they please? This assumes consumers have access to accurate and balanced information. How could smoking be a fully informed choice when tobacco companies spent decades deliberately suppressing, manipulating, and undermining the scientific evidence?799 “Don’t worry your pretty little head,” said the nanny companies.

Is the food industry any different? We are bombarded with conflicting nutrition messages.800 People love hearing good news about their bad habits, so clickbait headlines like “Butter Is Back” may sell a lot of magazines, but they sell the public short.

“It is not just Big Tobacco anymore,” declared the director-general of the World Health Organization.801 “Public health must also contend with Big Food, Big Soda, and Big Alcohol. All of these industries fear regulation, and protect themselves by using the same tactics … front groups, lobbies, promises of self-regulation, lawsuits, and industry-funded research that confuses the evidence and keeps the public in doubt.” It’s like that infamous tobacco industry memo that read: “Doubt is our product since it’s the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the mind of the general public.”802 The tobacco industry didn’t have to convince the public that smoking was healthy to get people to keep consuming its products. It just needed to establish a controversy: Some science says it’s bad, some says it’s not so bad.

Conflicting messages in nutrition cause people to become so frustrated and confused they may just throw their hands up in the air and eat whatever’s put in front of them, which is exactly what the industry wants.

No purveyor of unhealthy products wants the public to know the truth. An extraordinary example of this is the tobacco industry’s 1967 response to the Fairness Doctrine. A court ruled that TV and radio stations had to run one health ad about smoking for every four tobacco ads they ran. Rather than risk the public being informed—even on a one-to-four basis—the tobacco companies withdrew all their own advertising from television.803 They knew they couldn’t compete with the truth. They needed to keep the public in the dark.

Now there are health warnings on each pack of cigarettes. Global travelers will notice, though, that while the U.S. mandate is met with simple, black-and-white text, other countries plaster evocative images, such as rotting gums, on their cigarette packs.804 Canadian smokers are forced to look at a drooping cigarette with the caption TOBACCO USE CAN MAKE YOU IMPOTENT. Similarly, U.S. food packaging just has the inscrutable bring-your-calculator-to-the-grocery-store nutrition facts label on the back. I don’t expect pictures of flaccid frankfurters, but other countries have tried to impose clear and simple front-of-package graphics to convey the health risks of fattening foods.805

“Signpost labeling” offers easy-to-understand traffic-light symbols alerting shoppers to the salt, sugar, and saturated fat content of products right on the front of every package.806 When it’s been tried, investment analysts at Citibank concluded, “The magnitude of the sales impacts is such that we are left with the inescapable conclusion that the increased prevalence of front-of-pack signposts may lead to marked changes in consumer buying habits.” It works so well that green, yellow, and red traffic-light labeling poses “dire consequences” for certain food categories.807 No wonder the food industry fought it fiercely, spending more than a billion dollars to defeat it in Europe, an amount that’s ten times more than the drug industry lobby spends annually in the United States.808

It’s in the food industry’s interest to have the public confused about nutrition.

		The  "What the hell" effect

Vicarious Goal Fulfillment

What about labeling menus with calorie counts? Just as one might divine the significance of front-of-pack signpost labeling from the ferocity of the industry response, one could probably gauge the futility of calorie labeling by the ease at which such regulations have been passed. McDonald’s voluntarily started doing it nationally in 2012809 after a labeling mandate in New York City was found to have no overall effect on consumer behavior.810 Studies suggest such voluntary labeling could boost “perceptions of the restaurant’s concern for customers’ well-being,”811 while not stopping any Big Mac attacks.

At the same time, McDonald’s announced plans for adding seasonal produce to its menu.812 How cynical do you have to be to not at least recognize that as a good thing? Well, ironically, adding a healthy option can actually sway people to make even worse choices.

If you offer people with high self-control a choice of side dishes—something unhealthy like french fries or something more neutral like a baked potato—only about 10 percent of them will splurge for the fries. French fries are so unhealthy, though, that as a public health do-gooder, you add a third option, an even healthier one—a side salad—to appeal to their better natures. Even if they don’t choose the salad, perhaps more will elect the middle-ground baked potato. So how much further does french-fry fancying fall by adding the salad option to the mix? It shoots up to more than 50 percent. Without the salad option, only one in ten chose the fries over the baked potato, but it jumped to more than half of the people just at the sight of salad.

The same thing happens when you offer people the choice of a bacon cheeseburger, a chicken sandwich, or a veggie burger. In a “No Healthy Option” scenario where people were offered the bacon cheeseburger, a chicken sandwich, or a fish sandwich, 17 percent chose the burger. When the fish sandwich was replaced with a veggie burger, however, the bacon cheeseburger preference more than doubled, up to 37 percent. How can just seeing a healthy option push people to make unhealthier choices? The title given to the paper describing these series of experiments is “Vicarious Goal Fulfillment: When the Mere Presence of a Healthy Option Leads to an Ironically Indulgent Decision.” The thinking is that just by seeing the salad or plant-based option, people make the mental note to choose that the next time, thereby giving them the excuse to indulge now. Remember the self-licensing effect, where people making progress toward a goal rationalize making decisions that undermine it? These experiments suggest that even merely considering making progress can have a similar licensing effect.813

Note that the study participants weren’t just moved to make the unhealthier choice, but the unhealthiest one. Even if people don’t go for the salad or veggie burger option, you’d think that the presence of a healthier alternative might, at the very least, encourage people to choose something in between. Instead, it moved people in the opposite direction altogether. Compared to the “No Healthy Option” scenario of chocolate-covered Oreos, regular Oreos, or golden Oreos, adding a “lower-calorie” Oreo option doubled the likelihood study participants would go straight for the most indulgent chocolate-covered option. This is attributed to another illogical quirk of human psychology, the indelicately named what-the-hell effect. This is when one forbidden cookie can lead dieters to eat the whole bag. Once you’ve already strayed from your goals, why not go all the way? So once people decide they are going to get the salad the next time and spoil themselves “just this once,” they might as well go for the most indulgent choice.814

The halo of healthy foods can even warp our perceptions. When weight-conscious people were shown a burger on its own and asked to estimate its calories, the average answer was 734 calories. What happened when people were shown the exact same burger, but this time, it was accompanied by three celery sticks? The estimated number of calories dropped to 619. Did they think the celery had negative calories? No, most knew the celery had calories, too, but just the juxtaposition made the burger seem healthier. The same thing happens when you add an apple next to a bacon-and-cheese waffle sandwich, a side salad to beef chili, or some carrots next to a cheesesteak. About one hundred calories appear to disappear.815 Health halo effects may explain why people are more likely to order a dessert and more sugary drinks with a “healthier” sub at Subway versus a Big Mac at McDonald’s, even though the sub used in the study (filled with ham, salami, and pepperoni) had 50 percent more calories than the Big Mac.816

Even just a reference to healthy foods can cause this unhealthy behavior. Remember that crazy Big Mac study where the eat-your-fruits-and-veggies message steered people toward the sundae instead of the fruit? The findings get even wackier. When asked to estimate the calorie content of the burger pictured in the ad without any health messaging, people guessed 646 calories.817 What happened when the text For your health, eat at least five fruits and vegetables per day was added to the ad? All of a sudden, the same burger in the same ad appeared to only have 503 calories. So offering and even promoting salads and fruit can bring McDonald’s accolades and bolster consumer loyalty without, ironically, helping their waistlines.

Ad Nauseam
The third strategy taken from the anti-tobacco playbook, after taxes and front-of-pack labeling, is restricting advertising to children.819 The food industry spends more money on advertising than any other industry,820 with more than $10 billion in ads targeting American children and teens every year.821 As a case study example, allow me to profile the number-one food advertised to kids: breakfast cereals.

There have been calls for nearly a half century to ban the advertising of sugary cereals to children, which Harvard nutrition professor Jean Mayer referred to as “sugar-coated nothings.”822 In a Senate hearing on nutrition education, he said, “Properly speaking, they ought to be called cereal-flavored candy, rather than sugar-covered cereals.”823

The Senate committee had invited the major manufacturers of children’s cereals to testify. They initially agreed to participate—until they heard the kinds of questions that were going to be asked. One cereal industry representative candidly admitted why he decided to boycott the hearing: He simply didn’t have “persuasive answers” for why the industry tries to sell kids candy for breakfast.824

In the Mad Men age before the consumer movement was in bloom, advertising company executives were more willing to talk frankly about the purpose of their ads and how they felt about aiming them at the “child market.”825 For example, consider this 1965 quote from an ad executive for Kellogg’s and Oscar Mayer:

Our primary goal is to sell products to children, not educate them. When you sell a woman a product and she goes in to the store and finds your brand isn’t in stock, she will probably forget about it. But when you sell a kid on your product, if he can’t get it, he will throw himself on the floor, stamp his feet and cry. You can’t get a reaction like that out of an adult.826

To preempt federal regulations, the industry pledged to self-regulate and launched the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, in which all the big cereal companies promised they would only market healthier dietary choices to kids.827 The candy industry signed on too. How did that go? Well, how do you think it went? They pledged not to advertise to children, yet after the initiative went into effect, kids actually saw more candy ads. Hershey, for example, more than doubled its advertising to children, while, at the same time, pledging not to advertise to children at all.828

The cereal companies got to decide for themselves their own definitions of “healthier dietary choices,” and what they chose should give a sense of how serious they are about protecting children: They classified Froot Loops and Reese’s Peanut Butter Puffs, which consist of up to 44 percent sugar by weight, as “healthier dietary choices.”829 In that case, what are their unhealthy choices?! Rather than base it on what might be best for children, they basically set the limit based more on the sugar content of everything they were already selling.830

The industry has since revised the “healthier dietary choices” criteria to allow only cereals that are below 38 percent sugar by weight.831 Even if they’re “only” one-third sugar, that means kids effectively are eating at least one spoonful of sugar in every three spoonfuls of cereal.832 I wouldn’t call that a healthy dietary choice.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) tried stepping it back in 1978, but industry poured in millions to fight it, and, with enough campaign contributions, Congress essentially threatened to yank the entire agency’s funding if it continued to pursue industry regulations.833 This demonstrated to a former CDC nutrition director “just how powerful market forces are compared to those that can be mobilized on behalf of children.”834 The political post-traumatic stress induced by the industry backlash delayed further federal efforts to rein in food marketing aimed at children for decades.

But then, enter the Interagency Working Group.835 In 2011, FTC, CDC, FDA, and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) all came together to propose voluntary principles designed to encourage stronger and more meaningful self-regulation. Their radical suggestion? Don’t market cereal that is more than 26 percent sugar to children.836

Not a single one of the top ten breakfast cereals marketed to children would meet that standard.837 General Mills shot back that the proposed nutrition standards were “arbitrary, capricious, and fundamentally flawed.” After all, it pleaded, “literally all cereals marketed by General Mills would be barred from advertising.”838 One grocers’ association called the proposed nutrition principles the “most bizarre and unconscionable” it had ever seen.839 Cereal manufacturers charged that the suggested recommendations for voluntary self-regulation would unconstitutionally violate their “free speech rights” under the First Amendment,840 to which the FTC basically offered to get them a dictionary so they could look up the meaning of the word voluntary.841 All this gives you a sense of how freaked out the food industry got at even the notion of meaningful guidelines.

So what happened? Again, agency funding was put into jeopardy, so the interagency proposal was called off.842 “We just got beat,” one of the child advocacy organizations said. “Money wins.” It apparently took $175 million of Big Food lobbying to buy the White House’s silence as the interagency proposal got killed. As one Obama adviser put it, “You can tell someone to eat less fat, consume more fiber, more fruits and vegetables and less sugar. But if you start naming foods, you cross the line.”843

“I’m upset with the White House,” the chair of the Senate Health Committee said.844 “They went wobbly in the knees, and when it comes to kids’ health, they shouldn’t go wobbly in the knees.”


****************************************************************************************************
How We Won the Trans Fat Fight
In 2012, a prize-winning845 exposé on corporate lobbyists found that the food and beverage industries had never lost a significant political battle in the United States, winning fight after fight at every level of government.846 That all changed in 2018 with the successful ban on added trans fat in the American food supply. Trans fat, found largely in vegetable oils partially hydrogenated to mimic the qualities of animal fats in snack foods, was implicated in the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans every year.847 So how did the public health movement finally triumph?

There are three broad approaches to mediating the ruin of risky choices: inform people (such as through labeling), nudge people (perhaps with financial incentives), or directly intervene to make the activity less harmful.848 Which do you think prevented more car fatalities: mandating driver education, labeling cars about crash risk, or removing the human element by just making sure airbags are installed?849 There are public education nutrition campaigns—from “sugar pack” ads on public transit informing consumers how much sugar there is in soft drinks850 to “Hot Dogs Cause Butt Cancer” billboards educating people about the link between processed meat and colorectal cancer.851 But just warning people about trans fat wasn’t working.

We learned about the dangers of trans fat in 1993, when the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study reported that high intake of trans fat may increase the risk of heart disease by 50 percent.852 That’s where the trans fat story started in Denmark—a story that ended a decade later with a ban on added trans fat in 2003.853 It took another ten years before the United States even started considering a ban.854 All the while, trans fat continued to kill the estimated tens of thousands of Americans every year,855 resulting in as many years of healthy life lost as conditions like meningitis, cervical cancer, and multiple sclerosis.856 If so many people were suffering and dying, why did it take so long for the United States to even suggest taking action?

One can look at the fight over New York City’s trans fat ban for a microcosm of the national debate. Opposition came down hard from the food industry, complaining about “government intrusion” and likening the city to a “nanny state.”857 The livestock industries echoed858 the everything-in-moderation argument made by the Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils859 (since trans fat is present naturally in meat and dairy).860 Another argument went: If “food zealots” get their wish in banning added trans fat, what’s next?861 Critics styled proposals for a trans fat ban as the “rise of food fascism,”862 but it was really the restaurant and food industry that was limiting consumer choice, by so broadly fouling the food supply with these dangerous fats.863

Vested corporate interests tend to rally around these kinds of “slippery slope” arguments to distract from the fact that people are dying.864 What if the government tries to make us eat broccoli? Unbelievably, that actually came up in a Supreme Court case over Obamacare. Chief Justice Roberts suggested Congress could start “ordering everyone to buy vegetables,” a fear Justice Ginsburg dubbed “the broccoli horrible.” Technically, Congress could compel the American public to eat more plant-based, Justice Ginsburg wrote, yet one can’t “offer the ‘hypothetical and unreal possibilit[y]’ … of a vegetarian state as a credible [argument].”865 As one legal scholar put it, “Judges and lawyers [may] live on the slippery slope of analogies; [but] they are not supposed to ski it to the bottom.”866

But New York City eventually won its trans fat fight in 2006, preserving its status as a public health leader. New York, for example, banned lead paint eighteen years before federal action was taken despite decades of unequivocal evidence for harm.867 Comparing stroke and heart attack rates before and after the rollout of the trans fat ban in different New York counties, researchers estimate the ban successfully reduced cardiovascular death rates by about 5 percent.868 This then became the model for the nationwide ban in 2018.

How was public health able to triumph when past attempts to regulate the food industry failed? If you would have asked me back then about the odds of a trans fat ban, I would have answered: Fat chance.

In Denmark, as a leading Danish cardiologist put it, “Instead of warning consumers about trans fats and telling them what they are, we’ve simply removed them.” The cardiologist continued, “As they say in North America, ‘You can put poison in food if you label it properly.’”869 And in America, things do seem to work differently. The belief is if people know the risks, they should be able to eat whatever they want—but that’s assuming they’re given all the facts. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case, especially given the food industry’s “model of systemic dishonesty,” as one health ethics professor put it.870

Because of the predilection for predatory deception and manipulation, government intervention was deemed necessary when it came to trans fat. But how did the ban get passed? First there was a labeling requirement. Manufacturers had to start adding trans fat content to the nutrition facts labels. This ostensibly was to influence consumers, but it may have had a bigger impact on producers. Now that they had to divulge the truth, companies scrambled to reformulate their products to gain a “no trans fat” competitive edge.

Within a year of the mandatory disclosure, more than five thousand products were introduced touting low or zero trans fat on their labels.871 Kentucky Fried Chicken went from being sued for having some of the highest trans fat levels872 to running an ad campaign where the mom tells the dad in front of the kids that KFC now has zero grams of trans fat. The father yells, “Yeah, baby! Whoooo!”—and begins eating fried chicken by the bucketful.873 That was the secret to passing the ban. Once the major food industry players had already reformulated their products and bragged about it, once there wasn’t so much money at stake, then there was insufficient political will to block the ban.


//
Leveling the Playing Field
Even without regulations, the market can be rapidly responsive, but only within certain parameters. The gluten-free craze is a great example. Ten years ago, how many people had even heard the word gluten? And now, some surveys suggest as many as 25 percent of the population is trying to avoid it.874 This has led to an explosion of more than ten thousand products labeled as gluten-free,875 including ones from major players, such as Tyson Foods launching gluten-free bacon and lunch meat.876 Ironically, gluten-free products may be less healthy, with more sugar and salt, less fiber, and fewer nutrients, so they’re mostly just different shades of the same processed junk.877 A gluten-free donut is still a donut. And a nutritional analysis of foods marketed to children found that about 90 percent of products—both gluten-free and not—were classified as “unhealthy.”878

That’s the limit of the market. The invisible hand is more than happy to hand us any kind of junk we want—from SnackWell’s to keto cookies. The industries can make money off any fad, except real food. Shareholders can profit off any kind of Funyuns but can’t do much with real onions. Within a narrow scope of commodity components and chemicals, endless reformulations can fit any fashionable flavor of the month, but produce will never be as profitable.

The market even prevents food manufacturers from taking small steps to make their products less detrimental, such as lowering salt or sugar content. Any deviation from the levels perfectly engineered for maximum craveability could get you immediately undercut by your competitors. How then was England able to so successfully lower sodium intake, which has been associated with dramatic drops in stroke and heart disease deaths?879 Because it was done across the board. McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets have two and a half times more salt in the United States than in the United Kingdom, but that’s because Burger King UK was cutting down too.880

In the best-documented population-level sodium reduction to date,881 the British government formed public-private partnerships with major food manufacturers, retailers, and restaurant chains to simultaneously reduce sodium levels so slowly over the years that no one would notice.882 The secret sauce may be the level playing field, so no company could gain a commercial advantage by outsalting competitors.883 Analogous proposals have called for the stepwise, gradual, unobtrusive reduction in sugar in soft drinks to effect a similar shift in taste preferences on a population-wide scale.884

If this all sounds a bit Big Brother-y, realize that people can still season and sweeten to their heart’s desire (or rather, detriment). Salt your nuggets all you want. Dump the whole shaker on them and wash it down with a bottle of corn syrup—it’s still your body, your choice. It’s like the proposed cap on soft drink sizes. You can still drink all the soda you want. The idea is just to try to make the default options a little healthier. It’s easier to add salt to food on your plate than it is to remove it.

The lifesaving success of the trans fat ban and society-wide sodium reduction may lie in the convenience of improving consumers’ diets without them having to change their behaviors.885 Some view this as government overreach, but the slipperiest slope may be that of inaction. As the director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity has pointed out, governments initially defaulted to business interests in the case of tobacco to try to counter all the industry lies with weak and ineffective attempts at consumer education. And look what happened: “The unnecessary deaths could be counted in the millions,” he wrote. “The U.S. can ill afford to repeat this mistake with diet.”886

Until the political will is summoned to make industry-wide changes in our food supply, we need to take personal responsibility for our own health and for our families’ health because it looks to be a matter of life and death. So what does that best personal solution look like in the interim? That’s what the rest of this book is all about.

Anecdotes as Evidence
Most Americans have tried to lose weight at some point in their lives, and as many as around one in three is actively making the attempt at any given moment.894 This has spawned a massive weight-loss industry valued at more than $50 billion.895 With so much money at stake, it comes as no surprise that there are so many different flavors of snake oil on tap. The history of weight-loss quackery includes everything from body jigglers to suction-cupped rolling pins. There was the Relax-a-cizor, an ironic name for a device that delivers electric shocks,896 and wearing the Fat-Be-Gone ring promised the “same benefits as jogging up to six miles per day”!897 “Unwanted pounds and inches scrub right off” with the Amazing Seaweed Weight Loss Soap,898 and don’t forget the “amazing new super-formula” that will “overwhelm fat like Cary Grant overwhelmed your grandmother!”899

A major conclusion of congressional hearings on fraud in the diet industry was that the entire sector was characterized by deceptive and misleading advertising, rife with puffed-up promises.900 In an analysis of hundreds of weight-loss advertisements, the FTC found that most ads made at least one claim that was very likely to be false or, at the very least, lacking adequate substantiation. Some were “grossly exaggerated,” “obviously false claims” that were simply not “physiologically possible,” like the product that guaranteed weight-loss efficacy comparable to “running a 20 mile marathon while you sleep.” And it appears to be getting even worse. Compared to a similar analysis of ads in the 1990s, the FTC noted a “downward spiral to deception in weight-loss advertising.”901 The FTC has recovered millions for conned consumers, but a law journal article described the agency’s actions as a “mere slap on the wrist” for an industry worth billions.902

By 2001, nearly 80 percent of all ads for weight-loss products or programs featured at least one testimonial.903 Who doesn’t love a good story?904 Scientists often assert “anecdotes aren’t data,” but human nature may favor the opposite view—numbers are nice, but narratives can carry more meaning. Fund-raisers know this. They know to tug at the heart, not the head. It may not be surprising that people are more willing to donate to an African relief program after hearing a story of a starving little girl rather than give to an appeal outlining the dry statistics of the millions in need. But what is surprising is that when both the story and the stats are put together in the same appeal, people donate less than if they had heard just the anecdote.905 We are notoriously prone to embracing anecdotal evidence,906 and dietary hucksters rarely fail to exploit this hardwired human instinct.907

Researchers have compared the weight-loss claims of commercial programs to the actual results obtained from randomized controlled trials. Weight Watchers, for example, featured a testimonial of a woman who lost more than two hundred pounds after two years on the program908—but when Weight Watchers was actually put to the test, the average weight loss after two years was more like six pounds.909 The Weight Watchers watched a lot more weight stay on than come off.

The Atkins website boasted a three-hundred-pound weight-loss testimonial, and Jenny Craig a four-hundred-pounder. The average advertised testimonial weight loss across twenty different programs was about fifty pounds, a number far in excess of what even the programs’ own published trials have shown.910 Even if the rare testimonial were true, we almost never hear what happens next. When researchers actually followed up on some of the people portrayed in the before-and-after pictures, only about one in four had sustained their success.911 The commercial diet program that participated in this study must have suspected as much, as its cooperation with researchers was predicated on the stipulation that the program never be identified.912 This is consistent with the findings of the Deception and Fraud in the Diet Industry hearings in Congress that concluded most programs actively suppress facts about what to expect regarding chances of success.

****************************************************************************************************
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
Meta-Inflammation
One of the most important medical discoveries in recent years was the realization that inflammation appears to play a role in many of our chronic diseases, including at least eight of our top ten leading causes of death.928 The significance of this new understanding has been compared to the discovery of the germ theory, which, centuries ago, revolutionized our prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.929 Throughout most of human history, however, inflammation was considered to be a good thing. When you get a splinter in your finger and it gets red, hot, painful, and swollen, that’s inflammation. It’s your body’s natural reaction to tissue damage or irritation. So if the point of inflammation is to trigger the healing process, not a disease process, what’s going on?

That splinter reaction is an example of acute inflammation, a short-term, localized, specific response to infection or injury aimed at resolving a problem. In contrast, chronic inflammation, also called metabolic inflammation, or meta-inflammation for short, is persistent, systemic, and nonspecific, and it appears to perpetuate disease.930 It has a low-grade, smoldering quality—it’s not as though we’re red, hot, pained, and swollen all over. Simple blood tests, however, can detect abnormally high levels of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein so that we can gauge our level of chronic inflammation.

C-reactive protein levels in the blood are ideally under 1 mg/L,931 but in the presence of an infection, they can jump to 100 mg/L or more within hours.932 Now that we have highly sensitive C-reactive protein blood tests that can measure levels to a fraction of a point, the medical community has realized that walking around with baseline levels of even just 2 or 3 mg/L appears to set us up for increased risk of catastrophes like heart attacks and strokes.933 Having a C-reactive protein level under 1 mg/L denotes low risk, yet the levels of most middle-aged Americans exceed this,934 suggesting most suffer from chronic inflammation.

This widespread meta-inflammation appears to be our immune systems’ reaction to many unhealthy aspects of our lives—from the broader environment like traffic pollution and toxic chemicals to our day-to-day lifestyle choices, such as cigarettes, chronic stress, and too little physical activity and sleep.935 The primary driver of meta-inflammatory chronic disease, however, may be the portions of the outside world we introduce into our bodies multiple times a day: what we eat.


The Dietary Inflammatory Index
It’s easy to tell if a food is pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory: Feed it to people, and see what happens to their levels of C-reactive protein and other markers of inflammation. With this method, you can check the impact of individual nutrients, whole foods, meals, or entire dietary patterns.

To rate people’s diets, researchers developed a Dietary Inflammatory Index by scouring thousands of such experiments to come up with a scoring system.937 The more pro-inflammatory foods you eat on a daily basis, the higher your score, and the more anti-inflammatory foods you eat, the lower your score. If you eat more anti-inflammatory than pro-inflammatory foods overall, you could end up with the goal—a net negative score, an anti-inflammatory diet.

Broadly speaking, components of processed foods and animal products, such as saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol, were found to be pro-inflammatory, while constituents of whole plant foods, such as fiber and phytonutrients, were strongly anti-inflammatory.938 No surprise, then, that the Standard American Diet rates as pro-inflammatory and has the elevated disease rates to show for it.

Higher Dietary Inflammatory Index scores are linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease939 and lower kidney,940 lung,941 and liver function.942 Those eating diets rated as more inflammatory also experienced faster cellular aging.943,944 In the elderly, pro-inflammatory diets are associated with impaired memory945 and increased frailty.946 Inflammatory diets are also associated with worse mental health, including higher rates of depression, anxiety, and impaired well-being.947 Additionally, eating more pro-inflammatory foods has been tied to higher prostate cancer risk in men948,949,950 and higher risks of breast cancer,951,952 endometrial cancer,953 ovarian cancer,954 and miscarriages in women. Higher Dietary Inflammatory Index scores are also associated with more risk of esophageal,955 stomach,956 liver,957 pancreatic,958 colorectal,959 kidney,960 and bladder961 cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma.962

Overall, eating a more inflammatory diet was associated with 75 percent increased odds of having cancer and 67 percent increased risk of dying from cancer.963 Not surprisingly, those eating more anti-inflammatory diets appear to live longer lives.964,965,966,967 But how does the Dietary Inflammatory Index impact body weight?

****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Obesity and Inflammation: Cause or Consequence?
Pro-inflammatory diets are also associated with obesity, especially abdominal obesity.968 When researchers followed thousands of normal-weight adults over time, they found those eating more pro-inflammatory foods have higher annual weight gain and those on the most inflammatory diets have a 32 percent greater risk of becoming overweight or obese during about an eight-year period.969 The researchers were able to control for such nondietary factors as smoking and exercise—but is it possible that higher Dietary Inflammatory Index scores are just a reflection of a poor diet in general? The concept that diets with fewer fruits and vegetables and more meat and junk might lead to more weight gain isn’t exactly revelatory. How do we know the connection has anything at all to do with inflammation?

Dozens of studies have shown that obesity is strongly associated with increased levels in the blood of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein,970 but is that inflammation a cause or a consequence of obesity?

We used to think fatty tissue was just a passive depot for the storage of excess fat,971 but we now know it actively secretes inflammatory chemicals. Fatty tissue can expand so quickly it may outpace its blood supply and become starved of oxygen.972 (You can insert an electrode directly into an obese belly and measure how low the oxygen levels fall compared with healthy-weight individuals.973) This is thought to contribute to fat cell death, which draws out inflammatory cells like macrophages, a type of roaming white blood cell present in pus, to try to clean up the mess. If you take a belly biopsy of an obese individual, you can see that the fat is swarming with macrophages.974 The macrophages then appear to get stuck and fuse into giant cells, a hallmark of chronic inflammation seen in resistant infections like tuberculosis or around foreign bodies the body can’t clear.975 All the while, inflammatory compounds spill out into general circulation.976

Obesity, then, appears to lead to systemic inflammation, rather than the other way around.977,978 And even if inflammation had no role in the cause of obesity, you’d still want any weight-loss diet to be anti-inflammatory to mediate the inflammatory consequences of the excess body fat. But there is a way inflammation seems to play a cause-and-effect role in the obesity epidemic: inflammation in our brains. To understand how inflammation in the brain can lead to obesity, we must first understand how our brains regulate our appetites.

Obesity is widely viewed as a neuroendocrine (nerve and hormone) disorder caused by damage to the appetite-regulating circuits in our brains.979 Wait—isn’t it caused by indulgence in the cheap and easy overabundance of aggressively marketed fatty, sugary, high-calorie foods? Well, if that’s all it was, wouldn’t even more people be overweight? Maybe 90 percent instead of just 72 percent?980 The question that perhaps most intrigues obesity researchers is not Why are so many people fat? but rather, given how obesity-inducing our food system is, Why isn’t everyone fat?981

I know this is going to sound odd in a book about the obesity epidemic, but our bodies are actually remarkably good at regulating our weight. Think about it. We eat about a million calories a year, yet most of us only fluctuate by a few pounds. Without even thinking about it, our bodies maintain our energy balance with a precision exceeding 99.5 percent.982 You couldn’t even count calories that effectively. Literally. When put to the test, the calorie labeling on packaged foods was sometimes found to be so inaccurate that one investigation discovered up to a quarter of foods sampled failed to even comply with the 20 percent error allowed by the FDA.983 How do our bodies do better?

The master regulator of metabolism is the hypothalamus,984 an almond-sized part of our brains near eye level in the middle of our skulls. Just like your hypothalamus regulates body temperature by causing you to shiver when you get too cold and sweat when you get too hot, it also regulates body fat, causing you to eat more when you get too thin and less when you get too fat. It’s our “satiety center,” carefully controlling our appetites so we eat just the right amount over time and don’t gain or lose too much weight. But how exactly does the hypothalamus know how fat we are?

Our fat cells release a hormone called leptin, from the Greek leptos for thin. The more fat we have on our bodies, the higher the levels of leptin in our blood. The hypothalamus uses leptin levels as our fat thermostat and downregulates our appetites when leptin levels get too high.

“Experimental Obesity in Man,” a classic set of prisoner experiments published in the 1970s, showed how difficult it was to perturb this system of appetite regulation when it is working properly. Lean inmates in a Vermont prison were fed up to ten thousand calories a day in closely supervised meals with a goal of increasing their weights by up to 25 percent.985 This turned out to be surprisingly difficult. Most started dreading breakfast and sometimes involuntarily threw it up.986 Most powered through, though, and achieved the excess weight target. But as soon as they were released from the experiment, they tended to rapidly shed all those extra pounds and get back to around their original weights.987

This all makes sense based on what we now know about the leptin-hypothalamus fat thermostat. All that extra body fat led to extra leptin production, and in response, their hypothalami profoundly depressed their appetites until they got back down to baseline. When their fat volumes dropped back to normal, their leptin levels presumably dropped back to normal, too, and so it seems their hypothalami made their normal appetites return. How, then, do people become obese—and what does it have to do with inflammation?


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Inflammatory Brain Damage as a Cause of Obesity
People can gain weight—and keep it on—when there is damage to this leptin-hypothalamus circuit. Extreme cases of so-called hypothalamic obesity date back to 1840, when an “uncommonly obese” woman was found on autopsy to have a tumor near her hypothalamus.988 Anything that harms the hypothalamus can cause obesity—head trauma, aneurysms, brain surgery.989 Once the damage occurs and that feedback loop is broken, the hypothalamus can no longer respond adequately to rising leptin warning signals. As a result, people can develop out-of-control appetites, even to the point of having to be locked up for stealing food.990

You can imagine how the same thing could happen if a baby were born with congenital leptin deficiency, a condition in which their fat cells couldn’t produce leptin at all. Their hypothalami would never get the too-much-fat signal to turn down their appetites—and indeed, such children eat constantly, tragically becoming so obese some can hardly walk, sometimes exceeding one hundred pounds by age four.991

But inject these children with leptin, and the weight comes off. The first child this was tried on was a nine-year-old girl weighing more than two hundred pounds. Within days of the leptin administration, there was a marked change in her eating behavior. For the first time in her life, she felt satiated eating the same quantity of food as her siblings, in effect proving the importance of leptin in appetite regulation.992

Want to guess how eager the drug industry was to start injecting people with leptin as the next new miracle weight-loss cure? But remember: Obese individuals are already awash with excess leptin secreted by all their extra fat. The problem is that the leptin just isn’t working.

An analogy can be made with diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, blood sugars get too high because people can’t make enough insulin. Inject them with insulin, and their blood sugars come right back down. That’s like the kids with the rare leptin birth defect: Their body weights get too high because they can’t make enough leptin, but if you inject them with leptin, their body weights come right back down. In contrast, type 2 diabetics can make enough insulin, but the target tissues are resistant to the effects of the insulin. There’s already enough insulin in the body—in fact, there’s often excess insulin, as the pancreas tries to pump out more to overcome the resistance. The body just isn’t responding properly.

Similarly, obesity is thought to be caused by leptin resistance. Overweight individuals produce enough leptin—excess leptin, actually—but the target tissue, the hypothalamus, is resistant to its effects. So what can we do about it? Well, what do we do to treat insulin resistance?

Broadly, there are two ways to approach type 2 diabetes: The traditional medical model tries to overwhelm the system by injecting even more insulin, whereas the lifestyle medicine model instead treats the cause, attempting to reverse the insulin resistance itself so the body’s own natural feedback loop can start working again. Similarly with obesity, attempts have been made to try to overwhelm the system by injecting even more leptin, but why not instead treat the underlying problem by reversing the leptin resistance?993

Interestingly, insulin resistance and leptin resistance may share a common cause: lipotoxicity, from the Greek lipos, meaning animal fat. Lipotoxicity is caused by eating a diet high in calories with too much saturated fat and can result in inflammation.994

****************************************************************************************************
Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Fire
If you feed lab animals saturated fat, the fat crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in the hypothalamus within hours, causing inflammation, leptin resistance, and overeating.995 You can re-create this scenario right in a petri dish. If you drip the main saturated fat from the American diet (found mostly in meat and dairy)996 onto hypothalamic neurons, inflammation can be turned on like a light switch.997 The original animal studies were done with lard-based diets, but butterfat seems to work just as well.998 The good news is that when the lab animals were switched back to eating their regular low-fat food, their hypothalamic inflammation disappeared.999

So what about in humans? Extrapolating data from lab animals is infamously fraught with difficulty,1000 and obesity research is no exception.1001 For one, the diets between lab animals and humans are incomparable. Lard-based, high-fat rodent food may be around 60 percent fat.1002 But bacon is only about 40 percent lard,1003 so you could eat a 100 percent bacon diet and still not get the kind of fat intake that the rodent was receiving.

Because of the difficulty of extrapolating from animals, we didn’t know if the same kind of hypothalamic inflammation occurred in obese humans until researchers were able to use high-resolution MRI brain scans to put it to the test.1004 Subsequent comparisons with brain slices obtained on autopsy confirmed that what researchers were seeing on the MRIs was indeed the same hallmarks of hypothalamic inflammation.1005 The nerves were inflamed, but not destroyed, suggesting the whole process could be reversible. (No improvement in hypothalamic inflammation was seen about ten months after bariatric surgery,1006 but this is perhaps because stomach stapling can force a change in diet quantity but not necessarily diet quality.)

Randomized crossover trials show that by covertly increasing saturated fat intake, you can reversibly induce negative changes in brain function, mood, inflammation, and resting metabolic rate, and even, apparently, undercut motivation to exercise.1007,1008 Study subjects become 12–15 percent less physically active on high–saturated fat diets compared to low–saturated fat diets.1009 And note that researchers used a saturated plant fat—palm oil—found in some nondairy cheeses, vegan spreads, and other processed junk, so an anti-inflammatory diet is not just a move toward a more plant-based diet in general but specifically one centered around whole, unprocessed plant foods.

//
If Memory Serves

The hippocampus is the seat of memory in the brain. Structurally, it’s composed of two upside-down, seahorse-shaped ridges nestled deep in the temporal lobes. In Alzheimer’s, it’s one of the first areas to be hit. If saturated fat–induced inflammatory damage to the metabolic center of the brain may be contributing to obesity, what might that same damage be doing to the memory center?

When lab animals are fed saturated fat (lard), neurons in their hippocampi exhibit stress within seventy-two hours.1010 Subsequent memory problems and obesity suggest a vicious cycle, where saturated fat harms the hippocampus, causing memory impairments that result in even more lard being eaten—it’s as if they had forgotten how much they’d already had—and then goes on to cause more brain damage, cognitive dysfunction, and weight gain.1011 This finding inspired human investigations. MRI imaging scans taken of people’s brains approximately four years apart found that those eating junky, meat-centered diets experience a significant shrinkage of their hippocampi compared to those eating more healthful diets.1012 Saturated fat consumption is also associated with accelerated cognitive decline, but you don’t know if any of this is cause and effect until you put it to the test.1013

Researchers put people on a high-fat, ketogenic diet and confirmed a blunting of cognition, including impaired reaction times and attention, within seven days.1014 Another research team found that a high-fat diet impaired brain function in just five days: “Deficits were found in the speed of retrieval of information from memory, the ability to intensely focus attention, and performance of a complex higher order task involving working memory and attention.”1015

Even one bad meal a day for four days can impair our brain function. Australian researchers randomized men and women to eat either a breakfast high in saturated fat and added sugars or a healthier breakfast for four consecutive days. That’s all it took to cause a significant loss in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. People were instructed to repeat a list of twelve words over and over, for example, and then try to recall them twenty minutes later. Most were able to remember about 90 percent of them. For those randomized to eat one fatty meal a day for four days, their recall dropped down to around 75 percent. Although the high-fat breakfasts also had added sugar, overall sugar intake didn’t change over the four days or differ from the control group, but their intake of saturated fat was double.1016

The fatty breakfast group also appeared to suffer a hit to their interoception, the ability to perceive internal body states. In other words, they had to eat more food, about seventy calories’ worth, to feel the same sensation of satiety and fullness. The impaired hunger sensitivity, combined with the poorer memory retention, would seem to be a setup for weight gain. The hippocampal injury should be reversible, though. The researchers suggest that the recovery period to repair the damage done by those four fatty meals may be as short as four to six weeks.1017

Even though overall sugar intake didn’t change, the researchers suspect the breakfast “burst” of saturated fat and added sugar was the most plausible cause.1018 A single meal high in saturated fat (equivalent to a quarter-pound cheeseburger and large fries) has been shown to increase whole-body insulin resistance by 25 percent.1019 That, combined with the added sugars, could spike blood sugars high enough to contribute to the hippocampal dysfunction. As the accompanying medical journal editorial put it, a single load of saturated fat “packs a punch.”

//
FOOD FOR THOUGHT

By choosing to eat more anti-inflammatory foods and fewer pro-inflammatory foods, we may be able to both prevent and treat the damage to the appetite-regulating apparatus in our brains that can lead to—and sustain—obesity.

In the Dietary Inflammatory Index, the single most anti-inflammatory food is the spice turmeric, followed by ginger and garlic, and the most anti-inflammatory beverage is green or black tea. The two most anti-inflammatory food components are fiber and flavones.1021 Dietary fiber is found in all whole plant foods, but it is most concentrated in legumes, such as beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils.1022 Flavones are plant compounds concentrated in herbs, vegetables, and fruits,1023 and the leading sources in the U.S. diet are parsley, bell peppers, celery, apples, and oranges.1024 The most flavone-filled beverage is chamomile tea.1025

The most pro-inflammatory food components are saturated fat and trans fat. Essentially, the top five sources of saturated fat in the United States are cheese, desserts like cake and ice cream, chicken, pork, and then burgers.1026 Thankfully, with the ban on added trans fat, the only remaining sources in the food supply will be the small amounts found naturally in meat and dairy and created in the refining of vegetable oils.1027

Ultimately, an anti-inflammatory diet in clinical practice first and foremost “focuses on eating whole, plant-based foods.”1028 As I mentioned, not all plant-derived foods are anti-inflammatory (like the tropical oils), just as not all animal foods are pro-inflammatory. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, for example, score as an anti-inflammatory component in the Dietary Inflammatory Index.1029 Though fish oil may not affect systemic inflammation in healthy individuals,1030 it can reduce inflammatory markers in those with chronic disease.1031 Curiously, unlike plant-based omega-3 sources like nuts, fish consumption is not associated with lower inflammatory disease mortality.1032 Perhaps the benefits of the omega-3s are offset by the industrial toxins that now contaminate much of the aquatic food chain.

CLEAN
Obesogenic Pollutants
The notion that we are being exposed to obesogenic pollutants—that is, obesity-generating chemicals—went from mere speculation in an alternative medicine journal in 20021034 to strong scientific plausibility within a decade.1035 The supposition started out on pretty shaky ground, pointing out, for instance, that recent national surveys appear to show our weight exceeds what we report eating.1036 Therefore, the argument went, something else must be going on beyond just calories in and calories out. But it is notoriously difficult to get an accurate calorie count from dietary recall surveys, especially from overweight individuals, who tend to underreport their intakes.1037

Theoretically, though, the obesogen concept was not that much of a stretch. All sorts of synthetic chemicals cause obesity in humans: They’re called medications. Multiple classes of drugs are infamous for contributing to weight gain, such as certain types of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and diabetes medications.1038 The animal agriculture industry has made fattening into a science, utilizing a whole array of chemicals, hormones, and pharmaceuticals to pack on the pounds.1039 An analysis of chicken feathers found that the poultry industry appears to feed the birds everything from arsenic1040 to Prozac.1041 (Poultry producers say feeding caffeine “keeps the chickens awake so that they eat more and grow faster.”1042)

So what evidence do we have that chemicals are making us grow fatter too?

Early on, the purported link between chemical pollutants and obesity was based in part on the observation that the rise in chemical production seemed to coincide with the rise of the obesity epidemic.1043 Yes, but how many other millions of changes have there been over the last half century? Why jump to pollution when there are so many other easier explanations, everything from couch potatoes to fried potatoes?

One clue that pollutants may be playing some role is that our pets are also getting fatter.1044

Fido isn’t drinking more soda. Of course, the more Seinfeld reruns we watch, the less we may walk the dog, but what about our cats? Are we just giving them—and our kids—a few too many treats? That would seem a simpler explanation than imagining pervasive, obesity-causing chemicals building up in the pet and person food chains. It’s not just our kitties and kiddies, though. A remarkable paper was published in 2011 entitled “Canaries in the Coal Mine: A Cross-Species Analysis of the Plurality of Obesity Epidemics.”1045 It was a study of more than twenty thousand animals from twenty-four distinct populations, including feral animals, lab animals, and even urban and rural rats. The researchers found “large and sustained” increases in body weight nearly across the board, not just among pampered pets.

We’re all getting fatter. The odds that every single population studied would be getting heavier just by chance are around eight million to one. Given that evidence, it’s hard to blame our collective weight problem just on things like dwindling phys ed classes, the advent of video games, or junkier food. And our infants are heavier too. There’s been an alarming rise in obesity rates among young children under two years of age.1046 It’s hard to argue that today’s six-month-olds are eating more or exercising less than they were in previous generations.

These are the kinds of data that piqued serious interest into the search for obesogenic chemicals, and to date, about twenty different purported obesogens have been found.1047 The most well-studied thus far is a group of tin-based biocides known as organotins.

//
The Case of the Sex-Change Paint
Organotins were used in “antifouling” paint applied to the outer hulls of ships and other submerged structures like fish farm cages and oil rigs to prevent barnacles from attaching. But once this chemical was being used widely, scientists began to notice that female sea snails started to grow penises.1049 As a result of a variety of hormone-disrupting effects, organotins were banned from the maritime industry in 2008.1050 Disrupting hormones isn’t the only thing these compounds do, though. Organotins also activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, or PPAR-γ, which is the master regulator of adipogenesis, the process of creating new fat cells (known as adipocytes).1051

Once activated, PPAR-γ recruits connective tissue stem cells to turn into new fat cells. PPAR-γ stimulation can also cause fat cells to swell up even larger with fat. In other words, contact with this chemical leads to more, and bigger, fat cells,1052 and exposure in the womb to organotins may permanently establish an elevated fat cell count throughout our lives.1053

By the time we hit early adulthood, the total number of fat cells in our bodies remains fairly stable.1054 When we gain or lose weight, we are pretty much just enlarging or shrinking our existing fat cells. Starting out with a higher number of fat cells or gaining more later in life may make it easier to put on pounds, harder to lose them, and more difficult to maintain weight loss.1055

What’s more, each fat cell we make may be at the expense of one fewer bone, cartilage, or muscle cell.1056 The connective tissue stem cells recruited by PPAR-γ to become fat cells could have otherwise become any of those other types of cells, so excess PPAR-γ activation could potentially set us up not only for obesity but also osteoporosis.1057 The swiss cheese–like holes in osteoporotic bone are often filled with fat.1058 Perhaps this is why the PPAR-γ-activating diabetes drug rosiglitazone (sold as Avandia) not only causes weight gain as a side effect but appears to increase the risk of bone fractures as well.1059

How are we exposed to PPAR-γ-activating organotin compounds? Mainly through food, especially from fish and other seafood.1060 Even though organotins were banned on boats and other marine vessels years ago, they persist in our waterways, and contamination levels in fish fillets remain comparable to those obtained worldwide before the ban.1061 Some fish are worse than others. Halibut, swordfish, and canned tuna have been recorded as having the highest levels,1062 and a sampling of U.S. market-bought seafood found that farm-raised fish was generally worse than wild-caught.1063

Are the contamination levels high enough to be of concern? Researchers calculated the “tolerable average residue levels” for tributyltin, a common organotin, in seafood products around the world, defined as the levels in seafood tolerable for the average adult consumption pattern. Of the eighty-four U.S. seafood samples examined, seven products exceeded this level, or about 8 percent.1064 Note this is for the average adult consumer, so the percentage would be higher in children or those who ate more seafood than average. The percentage violating the tolerable average dose exceeds 30 percent in Japan, for example, but that is because the Japanese tend to eat more seafood, not because their fish is any more contaminated.

//
Everybody’s Plastic
Persistent pollutants have blanketed the world and now are found even in the Arctic, thousands of miles from known sources. Fortunately, many have been regulated strictly since the Stockholm Convention in 2004,1065 but unfortunately, there continue to be hormone-disrupting chemicals that are underregulated or not regulated at all. DDT, the banned pesticide now found mostly in meat, particularly fish,1066 is a “presumed” human obesogen1067 responsible for perhaps thousands of annual childhood obesity cases.1068,1069,1070 Meanwhile, the number attributable to the plastics chemical bisphenol A (BPA) may be in the tens of thousands.1071

BPA was first developed more than a century ago as a synthetic estrogen.1072 It wasn’t until the 1950s, however, that the manufacturing industry realized BPA could also be used to make polycarbonate plastic. Despite having long been recognized as having hormonal effects,1073 BPA rapidly became one of the most widely used chemicals worldwide.1074 It’s currently one of the highest-volume chemicals produced globally, with more than six billion pounds made each year.1075

In a petri dish, BPA was shown to accelerate the formation of new fat cells1076 and increase fat accumulation within fat cells, but that was at doses many thousands of times the concentration found in most people’s bloodstreams.1077 Though more than 90 percent of Americans tested in a national survey had BPA circulating in their bodies,1078 it was at concentrations down around 10 nM.1079 In contrast, those early studies were using 25,000–80,000 nM. We knew there were estrogenic effects even at those low, real-world doses,1080 but it wasn’t discovered until recently—in part using fat samples taken from children1081 and adults1082 undergoing abdominal surgery—that fat cell formation could also be affected by BPA at as little as 1 nM.1083 Even once metabolized by the liver, which destroys the estrogenic effects, BPA retains the ability to promote adipogenesis, the process of creating fat cells.1084,1085

BPA exposure at all life stages tends to correlate with increased weight,1086 and population studies in the United States, Canada, China, and South Korea have found it to be associated with various body fat measures.1087 Six out of seven BPA studies on general obesity and five out of five studies on abdominal obesity have found a link. Putting together all the studies, those with the highest BPA levels had 67 percent greater odds of obesity compared to those with the lowest.1088 In men, BPA may also be associated with lower lean body mass.1089 Those in the highest quarter of BPA urine levels averaged about three pounds less lean mass than those in the lowest quarter, suggesting BPA may have negative effects on muscle as well. (BPA exposure is also associated with declining male sexual function, but that’s a whole other book.1090)

How can we stay away from BPA? A small amount of exposure comes from handling thermal paper, such as cash register receipts and printed tickets,1091 especially if our hands are greasy or wet after the application of lotion or sanitizer.1092 Ninety percent of exposure, however, appears to be from our diets.1093 How can you tell? When people fast for a couple of days, their BPA levels drop as much as tenfold.1094

Fasting isn’t very sustainable, though. Researchers had families try a “fresh foods intervention,” where the families switched away from canned and processed foods. (Why canned? BPA is used in the epoxy that lines most canned goods, since it costs companies about 2 cents more per can to use non-BPA material instead.1095) Simply by avoiding canned and processed foods, the highest BPA levels dropped 76 percent within three days.1096

Alternately, you can conduct the experiment by adding a serving of canned soup to people’s daily diets. Compared to serving soup prepared with fresh ingredients, five days of a daily serving of canned soup led to a 1,000 percent rise in BPA levels in the urine.1097 It could have been even worse had they used cans of condensed soup, which may have about 85 percent more BPA than cans of ready-to-serve soup. Otherwise, the highest BPA levels have been found in canned green beans and canned tuna.1098 The only fresh food found contaminated with BPA in the United States was sliced turkey.1099

Take-Home Tip: BPA is why I specify in The How Not to Die Cookbook to choose beans and tomato products in jars, aseptic packaging (Tetra Paks), or BPA-free cans. Eden Foods, for example, has a line of BPA-free canned beans. You can also BYOB: Boil Your Own Beans. It’s cheaper, and they end up with a better texture. My favorite way is to use an electric pressure cooker (like an Instant Pot).

Phthalates are another class of plastics compounds associated with weight gain.1100 A European consensus panel of obesogen experts gave a 40–69 percent probability of phthalate exposure causing more than fifty thousand cases of obesity annually in older women.1101 Rapid plunges in phthalate levels upon fasting implicated dietary sources,1102 and significant drops within days of having people eat a vegetarian diet gave researchers a clue as to where to look.1103

Indeed, high concentrations of phthalates have been found consistently in some meats (particularly poultry), fats, and some dairy products.1104 The fact that egg consumption is also associated with elevated phthalate levels suggests that the chickens themselves are contaminated even before they’re wrapped in plastic for sale.1105 The phthalates in dairy, though, appear to be from the plastic tubing in milking machines, as dairy from hand-milked cows can have ten times less.1106 Diets high in meat and dairy can sometimes contain up to four times the Environmental Protection Agency’s recommended daily phthalate safety limit.1107

This is what makes population studies linking pollutants and obesity so difficult.1108 Phthalate levels just may be an indicator of fried chicken intake, and BPA levels a sign of SPAM consumption. Similarly, just as exposure to plastics chemicals may be an indicator of a diet bereft of fresh foods, DDT exposure may be a marker for the foods that frequently contain the highest levels of DDTs identified by the Endocrine Society: “meat, fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, butter and milk.”1109 Pollutants like DDT are just one of many reasons why diets rich in those foods might be associated with obesity risk.


Take-Home Tip: BPA and phthalate metabolites are detectable in 95 percent of the U.S. adult population.1110 BPA is already banned from baby bottles and sippy cups in the United States,1111 but for other plastic containers, keep an eye out for recycle codes 3 and 7, as those indicate items that are more likely to contain high levels of BPA.1112 Certain phthalate levels are now banned from toys for children,1113 but not from “toys” for adults. Jelly-based sex toys are often made from a plasticized vinyl material packed with phthalates. Sticking to water-based lubricants may reduce phthalate transfer a hundredfold, but such adult toys may still have opposite the intended effect.1114 Women with the highest levels of phthalates flowing through their bodies report more than twice the odds of lack of interest in sexual activity.1115

//
Up in Smoke
In 2015, when meat was officially classified as a “known carcinogen” or a “probable carcinogen” depending on whether or not it was processed, the focus was on substances generated during cooking, curing, or smoking, rather than on pollutant contamination.1116 Given this, we could just follow recommendations to keep cooking temperatures under 260°F, thereby avoiding broiling, roasting, pan-frying, or any other cooking method that causes a crust to form, and instead stick to boiling or microwaving to keep the outside “pale and soft.”1117 But even just being around a barbecue may be hazardous, based on the recognition that light clothing probably provides little protection from gaseous carcinogens.1118

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a class of combustion by-products found in cigarettes, car exhaust, and grilled meat,1119 may explain why the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project found a 47 percent increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women with a high lifetime intake of grilled, barbecued, or smoked meats.1120 These contaminants may be more than just carcinogenic—they may be obesogenic as well. A nationwide study of thousands of young people found that the more children are exposed to PAHs, the fatter they tend to be. And prenatal exposure to these chemicals may cause a higher subsequent risk of childhood obesity.1121

If you look at one of the most common of these toxins, smokers get about half their exposure from food and half from cigarettes. For nonsmokers, however, 99 percent may come from diet. The highest levels are found in meat, with pork apparently worse than beef.1122 Even dark green leafy vegetables like kale can get contaminated by pollutants in the air, so don’t forage your dandelion greens next to the highway, and make sure to rinse your broad-leafed greens well under running water.1123

PAHs are fat-soluble, so absorption may be diminished with eating lower-fat foods,1124 but importantly, they don’t appear to build up in your body. Unlike persistent pollutants like PCBs, a particularly toxic class of man-made chemicals that may take fifty to seventy-five years to clear from the body after regular (even monthly) meals of farmed Atlantic salmon,1125 PAHs can pass in and out of you in a day. If you have people eat a meal of barbecued chicken, you can see a big spike in these chemicals in their systems—up to a hundredfold increase—but the body can detoxify most of them away within about twenty hours.1126 Rather than detoxing, though, perhaps it would be better not to “tox” in the first place—at least not on a daily basis.

//
Prepackaged Pollutants
Industrial chemical contaminants come prepackaged regardless of cooking method in “diary [sic] products, meat and fish.”1127 (Although dioxins are created when paper pulp is bleached, I have a feeling “diary” was an autocorrect error.) The Food and Drug Administration has regulations about toxic chemicals in the food supply, determining the “action levels” of contaminants above which foods must be removed from the market, but those levels tend to be far higher than the levels based on health standards set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For example, a glass of milk tainted with the amount of DDT permitted by FDA’s action level would expose a consumer to nearly ten times the daily exposure considered “safe” by the CDC, and a single serving of fish could be sold with fifty times the daily limit.1128 Presumably, the reason the commercial standards are so lax is because too much food would have to be pulled from the shelves.

The USDA determined that, based solely on dioxin levels, American children consuming average servings of meat, including poultry (which regularly contained the highest levels they found), could be ingesting in excess of the daily safety limit.1129 Taking all thirty-three chemical pollutants in meat shown to be potentially carcinogenic into account, some European toxicologists suggest limiting children’s consumption of beef, pork, and chicken to no more than five servings a month, an average of no more than one serving every six days or so.1130 In Europe, lamb is the most contaminated and the recommendation calls for adults to eat no more than a single serving every four or five months.1131

In the United States, if there was any standout, it would be chicken and PBDE flame-retardant chemicals—not only compared to other meats but also to other countries. U.S. chickens are about ten to twenty times more contaminated than chickens tested from other countries.1132 Sadly, the newer flame-retardant chemicals introduced to replace the original PBDEs also1133 activate adipogenesis, diverting stem cell development away from bone building and toward the formation of fat.1134

Meat is certainly not the only source of flame-retardant exposure, though, as those eating vegetarian diets only have about 25 percent lower levels in their bloodstreams.1135 For other chemicals, meat may play a larger role. Studies dating back over thirty years looking at the pollutants in the breast milk of vegetarians have found the average vegetarian levels of some pollutants were only 1–2 percent as high as the national average.1136 For six out of seven pollutants reviewed, there wasn’t even an overlap in the range of scores; the highest vegetarian value was lower than the lowest value obtained in the general population. This is presumed to be because these pollutants concentrate up the food chain, so by eating more from all the way down the food chain, those eating more plant foods may have an edge.1137

The problem with studies just comparing populations is that you can’t single out the diet. Maybe vegetarians have other lifestyle behaviors that protect them. You don’t know until you put it to the test by changing people’s diets and seeing what happens. That’s hard to do with persistent pollutants like PCBs, which may take literally decades to detoxify from the body, but we can get rid of heavy metals like mercury in a matter of months. And, indeed, within three months of the exclusion of eggs and meat, including poultry and fish, from people’s diets, there was a significant drop in their levels of mercury, cadmium, and lead. Within just a few months of changing their diets, the levels of toxic heavy metals in their bodies dropped by up to about 30 percent.

//
What About Organic Meat?
What if we just stick to organic meat? Certified organic meat comes from livestock fed organically produced feed free of pesticides and animal by-products. Therefore, you would assume there would be less chemical residue accumulation, but there hadn’t been any studies measuring the chemical contamination in organic meat until recently. Researchers acquired seventy-six samples of different kinds of meat, both organic and conventional, and quantified their levels of contamination with thirty-three different persistent toxic pollutants. No sample was completely free of industrial toxins, which is to be expected given how polluted our world has become. What was surprising, though, was how minimal the differences were between organically and conventionally produced meats. In some cases, organic was inexplicably worse. Whether choosing conventional or organic meat, the researchers concluded that the current pattern of meat consumption exceeded the maximum tolerable safety limits either way.1139

Given that 90 percent of persistent pollutant exposure comes from animal-derived foods,1140 it’s no surprise that those eating more low-carbohydrate, high-protein-type diets have higher levels of pollutants circulating in their systems. This included PCBs 118 and 153, trans-nonachlor (a component of the banned pesticide chlordane), hexachlorobenzene (a banned fungicide), DDE (from DDT), mercury, and lead.1141 Mediterranean diet scores were correlated with elevated levels of PCBs (118, 126, 153, and 209), trans-nonachlor, and mercury, presumably because of the focus on fish consumption.1142

Any increase in body fat caused by obesogenic chemicals could potentially serve as a reservoir for further chemical accumulation, possibly setting up a vicious cycle.1143 Our fat stores—like those of farm animals—harbor toxic pollutants. How do we know this? Because we see a surge in these chemicals in people’s bloodstreams as they lose weight.1144 After bariatric surgery, for example, certain pollutant levels can rise more than 300 percent.1145

The release of these compounds trapped in our body fat may then affect our metabolisms, slowing down the rate at which we burn calories during sleep, which could frustrate additional weight loss.1146 To help break this cycle, a reduction in animal fat is suggested to reduce further accumulation of pollutants, along with an increase in whole grains, as the fiber may help draw toxins out of the body.

//
What About Organic Produce?
A recent expert review on obesogens suggests that doctors can help patients reduce their exposure by advising them to choose organic fruits and vegetables “insofar as possible.”1148 What evidence is there that the pesticides used on produce may play a role in the obesity epidemic? Just as the link between asbestos and disease first became apparent when studying those with the greatest exposure—miners and shipbuilders—public health researchers set out to study more than eight thousand licensed pesticide applicators to see if there was any connection between crop pesticides and weight gain.1149 One pesticide stood out, atrazine, the weed killer commonly used in corn production that was found to induce complete feminization of frogs—as in total sex reversal, with male frogs ending up laying eggs.1150 Agricultural workers spraying lots of atrazine had about 50 percent greater odds of being overweight and obese.1151

Just because levels in the field may predispose people to obesity doesn’t mean levels in the grocery store are high enough to have any effect, though. To see if buying organic makes a difference, can’t we just compare the body weights of those who choose organic to those who don’t? A study of more than fifty thousand consumers did exactly that, and those who chose organic “most of the time” only had about half the obesity rates of those who “never” chose organic.1152 Your critical thinking alarm bells should have started ringing instantly. Think of all the other attributes of organic shoppers. Indeed, those choosing organic were better educated and better off financially, both of which in and of themselves have been associated with lower obesity risk,1153,1154 and, more to the point, exercised more and had better diets. Those who chose organic ate more whole plant foods and less meat, dairy, and junk. No surprise they had a healthier weight.

The researchers controlled for each of these other factors, however, and still found dramatically lower obesity rates in “most of the time” organic consumers, though not necessarily in those who just chose organic “occasionally.”1155 Still, this was just a cross-sectional study, meaning a snapshot in time. Rather than conventional foods contributing to weight gain, maybe weight gain led people to throw up their hands and care less about how their food was grown or produced.

In 2017, we got a prospective study where people were followed over time. Sixty thousand French consumers were followed for about three years to see if those choosing organic gained less weight. After controlling for such factors as education, income, physical activity, and overall dietary quality, those who reportedly ate more organic foods were significantly less likely to become overweight or obese.1156 Note, though, that this was only for those choosing healthier diets in general. Eating organic Oreos and Pop-Tarts doesn’t do your body any favors.

Take-Home Tip: Personally, I try to choose organic whenever I have the option, but I never let pesticide concerns prevent me or my family from indulging in as many fruits and vegetables as possible regardless of how they were grown.

Microplastics in Seafood

In 1869, a patent was taken out on a new substance to replace elephant ivory in the production of billiard balls, and the plastics industry was born.1157 What started as a conservation-minded measure has turned into an environmental calamity.1158 Trillions of little plastic particles now float on the surface of the sea.1159 Plastic objects like water bottles get worn down into tinier and tinier pieces, and plastic microbeads in personal care products like facial cleansers flow from our sinks down into the waterways. Up to ninety-four thousand microbeads are flushed down the drain in a single rinse.1160

The plastic then accumulates toxic compounds from the water and shuttles them, along with any chemicals originally in the plastic, into marine life, concentrating up the food chain and eventually ending up on our plates.1161 This may explain how fresh cod can sometimes end up with higher BPA levels than canned tuna.1162

It is inevitable that we’ll ingest at least some microplastics when we eat seafood, particularly when the entire animal is consumed, such as with sardines.1163 Researchers sampled twenty brands of canned sardines and sprats from thirteen countries over four continents and found plastic particles in about one in five.1164 They suggested the disparities may have been due to improper gutting in the contaminated samples, but in mammals, at least, ingested microplastics can get through the gut wall, circulate throughout the body, and even cross the placental barrier.1165

When researchers compared the level of microplastics in eviscerated flesh versus the guts of fish, the meat sometimes actually contained higher microplastics loads than the excised organs.1166 Some studies have detected microplastics in all fish muscle samples tested.1167 The average intake of microplastics from eating fish like flathead, grouper, shrimp scad, or barracuda may be in the hundreds per serving or in the dozens of plastic particles in a two-ounce, child-sized serving.1168 As the particles travel through our bodies, they may then release any absorbed pollutants or plastics additives—some of which may play a role in the obesity epidemic.1169 Because of this, some have suggested weekly servings of these kinds of fish may threaten the health of consumers, especially vulnerable groups, such as children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

The obesogen field is still in its infancy but continues to gain scientific support.1171 The American Medical Association, American Public Health Association, and the Endocrine Society, the oldest and largest association of hormone specialists, have all called for improved regulatory oversight of hormone-disrupting chemicals.1172 We don’t have to wait to make simple diet and lifestyle changes to reduce our exposure, though. We can make a difference now by prioritizing plant foods, opting for fresh or frozen vegetables over canned, and, if eating or drinking out of polycarbonate and PVC plastics, choosing not to microwave them, put them in the dishwasher, leave them in the sun or in a hot car, or use them once they’re scratched,1173 as that can increase the release of the chemicals.

HIGH IN FIBER-RICH FOODS
Feeding Our Forgotten Organ
We used to think of food simply as a source of nutrients and energy, but we now know there are components in what we eat that can act as signaling molecules that bind to specific receptors within the body and trigger drug-like effects to regulate our metabolisms, among other things. Ironically, one of the food components that produces the most dramatic effects is something that initially appeared to be the most inert of dietary constituents: fiber.1174 In fact, telling people to increase their intakes of fiber-rich foods may actually be one of the single most effective pieces of advice for weight loss.

Fiber seems so, well, boring. By definition, fiber is indigestible. Since it can’t be absorbed into the body, it just stays in our gut to bulk up our stool. This is not to belittle the importance of bowel regularity. If just half the adult population ate three additional grams of fiber a day—only a quarter cup of beans or a bowl of oatmeal—we could relieve enough constipation to save billions in medical costs a year.1175 But it’s not as if we thought fiber really did anything beyond helping to keep us regular.

While it’s true we can’t technically digest fiber, that’s only applicable to the part of us that’s actually human. But most of the cells in our bodies are bacteria.1176 Our gut flora, which weigh more than one of our kidneys and are more metabolically active than our livers,1177 have been called our “forgotten organ.”1178 And our good gut bacteria don’t just digest fiber—they thrive on it. Fiber is like comfort food for your colon. So we can digest fiber, just not without a little help from our little friends.

What do the bacteria do with the fiber? They make short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with the fiber that can then be absorbed from the colon into our bloodstreams, circulate throughout our bodies, and even end up in our brains.1179 In this way, these fiber-sourced SCFAs can potentially have wide-ranging effects on everything from immune function and inflammation1180 to mental health1181—and, as you’ll see, may play a key role in regulating our appetites, metabolisms, and body fat.


Crowding Out Calories
The first major review, “Dietary Fiber and Weight Regulation,” included a dozen interventional studies in which people were randomized into higher-or lower-fiber diets. The additional consumption of fourteen grams of fiber a day led to an average weight loss of 1.9 kilograms over 3.8 months.1183 That’s only about a pound a month, but the weight loss was greater among those who needed it; overweight and obese study subjects lost triple the weight compared to lean individuals. How much is fourteen grams of fiber? Not much. Fourteen grams would barely bring the average American’s diet up to the recommended minimum average adequate daily fiber intake.1184

The increased fiber intake appeared to lead to about a 10 percent drop in daily caloric intake.1185 Why would more fiber mean fewer calories? Well, conventionally, fiber is considered to have zero calories, so it adds bulk to food without adding extra calories. To illustrate, let’s compare a food to its fiber-depleted equivalent. Consider a bottle of cold-pressed apple juice, which is basically an apple with its fiber removed. You could chug a regular 15.2-ounce bottle of juice in a matter of seconds, but to get the same number of calories, you would have to eat nearly five cups of apple slices.1186,1187 Which do you think would fill you up more? Obviously, the apple slices. But why?

First, you’d need to chew every apple slice. Fiber-rich foods require more chewing, slowing down eating rate, which itself can improve satiety.1188 This also allows for more secretion of saliva and stomach juices. In one study, researchers spread a barium paste onto slices of different kinds of bread and found that, upon x-ray, the stomach shadow was larger after eating whole-wheat compared to white bread, showing how much fuller you physically get.1189 So, in our cold-pressed apple juice versus apple slices scenario, we have the extra fluid secretion on top of the five cups of slices pushing on the walls of the stomach, which has nerves with stretch receptors that can send fullness signals directly to the brain.1190

One type of fiber in apples is pectin, the gelling agent used to make jams and jellies. Imagine how eating all those apples would not only add a lot of extra bulky volume but could start to form a gel to further slow the rate at which those five cups of slices left your stomach. This would keep you feeling fuller for longer compared to consuming the same number of apple calories in fiber-depleted juice form, which would pass right through you much more rapidly. Other gummy fibers like those found in oats can have the same gelling effect. Five grams of a highly gelling fiber can hold approximately one quart of water as it passes through the stomach and small intestine, so that’s like having an extra two pounds of zero-calorie food mass filling you up.1191

Obviously, juice is going to drain out of your stomach faster than apples, but even the same volume of fiber-depleted solid food exits more quickly. In a study entitled “Gastric Emptying of a Solid Meal Is Accelerated by the Removal of Dietary Fibre Naturally Present in Food,” researchers compared how long it took for a meal that included higher-fiber foods—whole-wheat pasta with puréed fruits and vegetables—to leave the stomach compared to a meal with the same volume and same calories, but made from white pasta and fruit and vegetable juices. The fiber-depleted meal was out of the stomach forty-five minutes earlier than the meal with the fiber intact.


It’s Not the Calories You Eat but the Calories You Absorb
Now imagine what happens next: The apple juice would get rapidly absorbed as soon as it spilled out from the stomach into the small intestine and spike our blood sugars, whereas sugar trapped in the mass of apple slices would be absorbed more slowly along the length of the intestine. Our bodies can only absorb nutrients when they come in physical contact with our intestinal walls, so fiber, which never gets absorbed, can act as a carrier to dilute and even eliminate calories out the other end. Fiber doesn’t just trap sugars; it can act as a fat-1193 and starch-blocker 1194 too. There are drugs on the market that can do this, but eating fiber-rich foods can do it more safely—and naturally.

What if you dipped those apple slices in peanut butter? Everything would get mixed together, and some of the peanut oil calories would make it all the way through the intestines, trapped in the middle of a gelled mass of apple fiber. In contrast, if you ate a spoonful of peanut butter and then washed it down with apple juice, the juice would get absorbed right off the bat, leaving the peanut butter to coat the walls of the intestine and all the calories to get absorbed. This has been demonstrated in experiments measuring fecal fat excretion dating back nearly a half century.

What happens if you feed people white bread with butter versus whole-wheat bread with butter, along with lots of fruits and vegetables, and measure how much butter comes out the other end? The higher-fiber whole-wheat group poops out more than twice as much fat as the white-bread group,1195 since some of the butter calories get trapped in all that fiber. Even if you just drink a third of a cup of oil on a high-fiber diet, you’d excrete twice as much fat as you would on a low-fiber diet.1196 The same goes for the calories of starch. Eat whole-grain bread as opposed to white bread, and stool analyses will find that you flush out nearly ten times as many carb calories.1197

It’s not what you eat but what you absorb, so you can lose more weight on a high-fiber diet eating the exact same number of calories simply because some of those calories get trapped and never make it into your system. Those on a Standard American Diet lose about 5 percent of the calories they eat in their waste,1198 but a higher-fiber diet can double that.1199 It’s not simply that the calories in high-fiber foods are less available. High-fiber foods trap calories across the board. So eat a Twinkie on a high-fiber diet and absorb fewer Twinkie calories! It’s like every calorie label you read instantly gets discounted on a high-fiber diet.

We learn in school that a gram of protein has four calories, a gram of fat has nine calories, and a gram of carbs has four calories—but that’s only on a typical, low-fiber diet. On a higher-fiber diet, up around the average of those eating completely plant-based diets,1200 the effective calorie counts drop from 4-9-4 to around 3.5-8.7-3.8.1201 That may not seem like a lot, but if Americans just reached the minimum recommended fiber intake, that might decrease calorie absorption by more than one hundred calories a day,1202 which may be enough to prevent that average, gradual, annual weight gain most experience through middle age.1203 Even a small, consistent change in daily calorie absorption could potentially have long-term significance for weight management.

****************************************************************************************************
Putting On the Brakes
A review entitled “Food Fibre as an Obstacle to Energy Intake” summarized what I call the Four Ds by which dietary fiber results in reduced caloric intake:1205 dilution of calories by expanding the volume of food, distention of the stomach through fluid absorption, delay in stomach emptying of the gelled mass, and dumping of calories by blocking the absorption of other macronutrients, such as carbs and fat. That fourth D triggers a fifth phenomenon known as the ileal brake.

The ileum is the last part of the small intestine before it empties into the colon. When undigested calories are detected that far down our intestines, our bodies put the brakes on eating more by curbing our appetites. This can be shown experimentally. If you insert a nine-foot tube down people’s throats and drip in protein, fat, or sugar, you can activate the ileal brake. Then, if you sit them down to an all-you-can-eat meal, they will eat at least one hundred fewer calories than those in the placebo group who had only gotten a squirt of water through the tube.1206 Activating the ileal brake can make people feel full up to nearly two hundred calories earlier.

Ever since its discovery, the ileal brake has been considered a medical target for appetite control. So did doctors simply advise patients to eat lots of whole, unprocessed plant foods so that the fiber would drag calories down to activate the brake? Not quite. Instead, they developed the first major bariatric surgery, the jejunoileal bypass.

Fiber-depleted foods get absorbed quickly and never make it all the way down to the ileum, but instead of having people eat foods in their natural form, some doctors decided just to cut out the intervening twenty or so feet of intestine. By attaching the end of the ileum right up to within about eighteen inches of the stomach, the ileal brake is activated no matter what you eat. It’s like your emergency brake is always on. You can still drive, but not as fast. So, with the jejunoileal bypass, you can still eat, but not as much because you’re already feeling full.

More than twenty-five thousand patients underwent the procedure in the United States before it was realized that cutting out 90 percent of the intestines wasn’t such a good idea. The jejunoileal bypass resulted in long-term progressive liver scarring in 38 percent of patients.1207 That’s nearly two out of every five patients. Though the surgical approach failed, the medical mind-set still prevails, with researchers teaming up with drug companies and the food industry to exploit the ileal brake for weight loss with “dietary encapsulation or slow release strategies,”1208 failing to recognize that Mother Nature already designed a natural strategy in the form of fiber-rich food.

//
Intestinal Workout
There are many ways eating more fiber means eating fewer calories, but the “Dietary Fiber and Weight Regulation” review found that study subjects randomized to consume higher-fiber diets lost more weight even when caloric intake was fixed.1209 Think about it: more weight loss even when prescribed the same number of calories. So if it wasn’t the calories-in side of the equation, could it be the calories-out side? Normally, calories out means things like exercise, but, in the case of high-fiber diets, there are literally calories out—as in out the other end and flushed down the toilet. But the same-calorie, higher-fiber groups were losing more weight even after taking into account the excess calorie dumping. Where were the calories going?

To solve the mystery of the missing calories, researchers fed people different amounts of fiber and sealed them in an airtight chamber called a whole-body calorimeter to closely monitor their metabolic rates.1210 Those with more fiber in their systems burned more calories—even in their sleep. Though it was only about 2 percent more, that translated into about fifty more calories burned a day without getting out of bed. What was going on?

For people on long-term, fiber-rich diets, the researchers figured that all that fiber might bulk up their intestinal linings, which are highly metabolically active tissues. The gut may only represent 5 percent of body weight, but it might burn 25 percent of daily calories.1211 Why were the research subjects spontaneously burning off more energy even while they were sleeping? It turns out all that extra fiber may be giving their gut a workout.

Our intestines are muscular tubes, so our small intestines are essentially twenty feet of muscle, which contract in waves to move food along. But fiber-depleted foods don’t offer much resistance. Wonder Bread and apple juice get absorbed almost immediately without much effort. It’s like pumping iron with barbells made out of Styrofoam.

Researchers had people swallow long strings of electrodes to measure the electrical activity of the muscular contractions of the intestines of those eating low-fiber meals versus high-fiber meals.1212 Those eating more fiber sometimes not only had stronger, faster, and longer contractions, but they had also reduced the periods of intestinal inactivity. Turns out our gut can be sedentary too. But if you eat lots of fiber-rich foods, your gut could be exercising all night long while you sleep.


****************************************************************************************************
Discovering the Keys to Weight Loss
This laundry list of mechanisms for fiber-induced weight loss included the best explanations we had back in 2001 when the “Dietary Fiber and Weight Regulation” review was published, but that was two years before a discovery was to change our ideas about fiber forever.1213

Cells are the fundamental unit of life. We’re composed of trillions of them,1214 and they communicate with each other through receptors on the cell surface. That’s how many hormones work: Like a lock and key, hormones are signaling messengers, and each has a unique shape. When released into the bloodstream, they circulate throughout the body until they find a receptor they can fit into. Once the key is in the lock, a whole series of reactions can be turned on or off in the target cell. For example, cells in our adrenal glands release adrenaline when we get scared, and there are receptors on our hearts, called beta receptors, into which adrenaline fits that can trigger an increased heart rate. That’s how beta-blocker drugs work to lower our heart rates—by gumming up this lock so adrenaline can no longer fit.

The largest family of cell receptors is known as G protein–coupled receptors. G proteins are molecular switches inside the cells that transmit the receptor signal.1215 More than one-third of the drugs currently on the market work by plugging into these receptors,1216 from antihistamines to heroin overdose drugs that block opioid receptors. We’ve discovered hundreds of different G protein–coupled receptors, but remarkably, we don’t know what many of them do.1217 We have the lock, but we just don’t know which key fits into them. Accordingly, these are called orphan receptors.

Two of these mystery receptors, known only as G protein–coupled receptor #41 and G protein–coupled receptor #43, were found heavily expressed throughout the body in our gut, on our nerves, and in our immune, muscle, and fat cells.1218 We knew they must be vital, but we didn’t know what activated them until 2003 when they were “deorphanized.” (That’s actually what scientists call it.) And the keys that fit into those important locks were the short-chain fatty acids that our gut bacteria make when we feed them fiber.1219

This may be how our gut bacteria communicate with us.1220 Renamed free fatty acid receptors, their existence gives us crucial insight into how fiber could play such a critical role in so many of our chronic diseases.1221 They may explain why fiber is so anti-inflammatory.1222 So, for example, how can a single high-fiber meal improve lung function in asthmatics within a matter of hours? The fiber we eat is turned into SCFAs by our good gut bacteria, which then are absorbed into our bloodstreams, where they are thought to dock with these free fatty acid receptors found on inflammatory immune cells in our airways, turning them off.1223

Hormones are defined as signaling messengers that are produced in one organ, circulate through the bloodstream, and have a regulatory effect on another organ. So these SCFAs could be considered hormones. It’s just that the organs producing them are our microbiomes, the bacteria that populate our gut. They can’t make these hormones without fiber, though. Just like our bodies need iodine to make thyroid hormones and our thyroid function suffers when we eat iodine-deficient diets, our bodies need fiber to make short-chain fatty acids and can suffer the consequences if we eat fiber-deficient diets.


Hacking Hunger Hormones
Short-chain fatty acids also stimulate the production of leptin,1224 the hormone produced by fat cells to tell our brains to trim us down. Leptin is an anorectic hormone, so called because it generates a loss of appetite and weight, but it does so over the long term. Leptin levels slowly rise as the volume of body fat gradually increases. In contrast, there are other anorectic hormones that work rapidly, signaling our brains on more of a meal-to-meal basis.1225 Two of these short-term appetite suppressants are PYY and GLP-1, both of which are secreted by specialized L cells that line our colons (named for their release of large packets of hormones).1226 Guess which receptors are crowded all over the surface of L cells? Free fatty acid receptors.1227

Drip some SCFAs onto L cells, and they start churning out PYY and GLP-1. You can do this in a petri dish1228 or in a person, either by infusing their rectums with an SCFA enema1229 or the old-fashioned way of feeding people fiber1230 or, even better, fiber-rich foods.1231 These hormones then get released into the bloodstream where they can shoot right up into the appetite center of the brain and turn down our cravings.1232

The flip side to PYY and GLP-1 is ghrelin, the so-called hunger hormone. Ghrelin levels rise in our blood before a meal to stimulate our appetites and fall right down once we eat, before slowly building back up again to propel us once more to the fridge.1233 But feed people twenty-four grams of fiber, and four hours later, ghrelin levels are suppressed as much as if they had just eaten five hundred calories’ worth of food.1234 Over the longer term, overweight eleven- and twelve-year-olds who had been randomized to increase fiber intake for sixteen weeks ended up eating hundreds of fewer calories at a buffet meal challenge compared to a placebo control group.1235

One of the most fascinating studies that has been done in this area involves putting people into an fMRI machine that measures real-time brain activity. Subjects were shown a high-calorie food such as a donut, and the reward centers in their brains instantly lit up compared to when they were shown a low-calorie food like cucumber slices. What happens if you repeat the experiment, but this time, after secretly delivering SCFAs directly into their colons? The subjects reported the high-calorie foods seemed less appealing, and this was matched by decreased activity in some of the reward centers in their brains, whereas their brains continued to react about the same to the less-craveable foods.

The researchers figured this was due to PYY and GLP-1 secretion, but that wasn’t the case: The effect was independent of hormone release. The researchers speculated that perhaps they had directly stimulated free fatty acid receptors on nerves in the gut that travel straight to the brain.1236 Similar results were not found with psyllium supplements (like Metamucil),1237 which makes sense since psyllium is nonfermentable, meaning our gut bacteria can’t eat it—so although it can improve bowel regularity, it cannot be used to make the key ingredients for appetite suppression.1238 Eat fiber-rich foods, though, and our good gut flora take the fiber we eat and churn out molecules that calm our cravings.

****************************************************************************************************
Putting Fiber to the Test
The evidence for the role of fiber in weight control started with so-called ecological studies.1239 These involve comparing population averages, noting that populations with extraordinary fiber intakes tend to have negligible obesity rates. The problem with dealing with population averages is that we don’t know if the individuals eating the higher-fiber diets are themselves necessarily the ones protected from obesity. In cross-sectional studies, you can confirm in both adults1240 and children1241 that those who eat more fiber are indeed significantly less likely to be obese. A problem with these types of studies, however, is that they represent only a snapshot in time, so you don’t know which came first, the obesity or the poor eating habits.

This brings us to cohort studies, where individuals and their diets can be followed over time. A cohort study of overweight youth found that the amount of fiber in a single, half-cup, daily serving of beans over about a two-year period was associated with a “profound” 25 percent difference in abdominal obesity.1242 In about the same time frame, in middle-aged women, each two-gram increase in daily fiber was associated with a weight decrease of about a pound.1243 The postpartum period places women at risk for retaining baby weight,1244 and a study of hundreds of new moms followed for the first five months found that inadequate fiber intake during the postpartum period appeared to increase obesity risk by 24 percent. And the benefits of fiber are not limited to women.1245 A cohort that included tens of thousands of men who were followed for years concluded that a daily ten-gram increase in fiber consumption might be expected to prevent about 10 percent of weight gain within the population.

Overall, the evidence is strong from these kinds of observational studies that “increasing consumption of dietary fiber with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes across the life cycle is a critical step in stemming the epidemic of obesity.”1246 These studies can control for nondietary influences like physical activity by equipping people with gadgets to measure their movement, but there may be uncontrolled confounding dietary factors. Think about that list of high-fiber foods—fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Maybe fiber intake is just a marker for the intake of healthy foods. There are many reasons why eating whole plant foods could facilitate weight loss that have nothing to do with fiber. To know if there’s a cause-and-effect relationship between fiber and weight loss, you need to put it to the test in interventional trials.

This is where rectal infusions come in handy.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, researchers showed that by infusing SCFAs into people’s rectums, you can boost their metabolisms within thirty minutes.1247 They used the amounts you’d expect to create yourself from eating a high-fiber diet. Not only did the subjects’ resting metabolic rate go up (that is, the amount of calories burned just by being alive), but specifically, their fat oxidation jumped up, too, increasing the amount of fat they were burning by more than 25 percent.1248 This translates into about an extra third of a pat of butter’s worth of fat burned off their bodies within two hours of the infusion.1249

Colonic catheters aside, you can feed people SCFAs directly and get the same little bump in resting metabolic rate and whole-body fat breakdown,1250 in addition to decreasing appetite. So, again, fiber may work on both sides of the energy-balance equation.1251 But does that decreased appetite actually result in people eating less? Given the equivalent of about ninety grams of fiber worth of SCFAs, study subjects consumed about two hundred fewer calories at an all-you-can-eat meal.1252,1253

Can’t you just feed people some beans? Indeed you can. Researchers in Sweden fed people beans for dinner, and, by the next morning, after their friendly flora had also had a chance to feast, their satiety hormones like PYY were up, their hunger hormone ghrelin was down, and they reported feeling less hungry.1254 The researchers didn’t measure subsequent food intake, but a similar study with whole-grain rye for dinner led to a decreased food intake at lunch the next day. Those who had eaten the fiber-rich whole grain the night before felt fully satiated about one hundred calories sooner at a meal more than twelve hours later.1255 So, by eating fiber-rich foods on a daily basis, you can set yourself up for success.

Using isolated fiber extracted from plants or made in a lab can be useful in experimentally proving fiber’s effectiveness apart from all the other healthy components in whole foods, but, if anything, you might expect even greater benefits from getting fiber the way nature intended: by eating intact plant foods.1264

Published in the prestigious Annals of Internal Medicine, a study entitled “Single-Component Versus Multicomponent Dietary Goals…” randomly assigned hundreds of people into one of two weight-loss regimens:1265 One simply encouraged people to get at least thirty grams of fiber each day, which is about the recommended minimum adequate intake, and the other advised people to also follow the far more complex weight-loss program recommended by the American Heart Association. So, in addition to also hitting that thirty-grams-of-fiber target, study subjects in the second group were prescribed carefully calculated caloric intake goals and were told to switch from red meat to white, moderate their alcohol intakes, cut down on sugary beverages, and reduce sugar and sodium intake across the board.1266

Even though both groups were told to reach the same fiber target, the group whose focus was solely on fiber intake ended up eating more than twice as much extra fiber as the multicomponent intervention and, surprisingly, similarly improved the quality of their diets. For example, the group focused only on fiber intake ended up reducing their saturated fat intakes as much as the group who was explicitly instructed to do so.1267 Simply telling people to eat more whole plant foods seems to naturally crowd out some of the less healthy options by default. With similar dietary improvements, both groups lost similar amounts of weight,1268 suggesting if you could give only one piece of weight-loss advice, eating more fiber might not be a bad choice. Of course, it only works if you actually do it.

There was one study that reported favorable results when eating a low-carb diet compared to a “high-fiber” diet. But just how high was this so-called high-fiber diet? The subjects started out at a pitiful 17.4 grams of fiber a day. Sadly, that’s about typical for the United States,1269 but it’s only about half the average recommended minimum daily intake of 31.5 grams.1270 The low-carb study subjects started out at 17.4 grams a day and, on their “high-fiber” diets, shot up to … 18.6 grams a day. Seriously. In no universe is that a high-fiber diet. Nevertheless, the low-carb study researchers used their findings to conclude “previous claims of the benefits of fiber for weight loss may have been overstated.”


****************************************************************************************************
Eating the Way Nature Intended
Fewer than 3 percent of Americans reach even the recommended minimum daily adequate intake of fiber.1272 There’s so much fuss about protein, but for that, the stats are reversed: More than 97 percent of Americans get enough protein, but more than 97 percent of Americans don’t get enough fiber. Nearly everyone is suffering from a fiber-deficient diet, and that’s just based on the wimpy federal recommendations of fourteen grams per thousand calories, which comes out to be about twenty-five grams per day for women and thirty-eight daily grams for men.1273 That’s a far cry from the hundred grams our bodies were designed to get,1274 based on the diets of modern-day, isolated, hunter-gatherer tribes1275 and an analysis of coprolites, human fossilized feces—paleopoo!1276

For perhaps more than 99 percent of our existence as a distinct species, the natural state of affairs was having our guts literally packed with fiber-filled foods all the time.1277 Before the gristmills and certainly for the millions of years before the first stone tools and evidence of butchering, our physiology evolved eating huge amounts of unprocessed plants.1278 That’s the nutritional landscape upon which our bodies developed.

This could explain why our bodies centered this whole elaborate system of body fat regulation around short-chain fatty acids, the microbial by-product of fiber. Indeed, for most of our time on Earth, fiber equaled food.1279 In fact, one of the theories used to explain the obesity epidemic is that the body’s mechanisms for controlling appetite evolved to match our ancestral diet.1280 It’s like a classic negative feedback loop (adapted from Sleeth et al.).1281

****************************************************************************************************
FOOD FOR THOUGHT

What are the best sources of fiber? The American Medical Association published a patient summary about fiber-rich foods listing an array of whole, unrefined plant foods.1292 Those of us who may be a little smug about our hearty intake of fruits and vegetables need to realize that fruits and leafy veggies are the poorest whole-food sources of fiber. Why? Because they’re 90 percent water. Root vegetables have about twice as much on a per-weight basis, but the fiber superstars are whole grains and legumes, which include dried or canned beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils.

****************************************************************************************************
HIGH IN WATER-RICH FOODS
Mouthwatering
Like fiber, water adds bulk to foods without adding calories. A prune and a plum are pretty much the same—one just has more water. You could eat a whole handful of prunes as a snack, but the same number of plums would be an armload. In a famous experiment, dozens of common foods were scored for their ability to satiate the appetites of individuals for hours, and the characteristic most predictive of satiety in general was water content.1294

Grapes, for example, have less fiber than bananas but were significantly more satiating—perhaps in part because of their greater water content.1295 Apples and oranges, which have even higher water content, beat out both grapes and bananas, but researchers fed people up to twice as much to match them calorie for calorie. So, in effect, they found that four oranges were more satiating than two bananas, which seems kind of obvious, but the size difference is exactly the point. Because apples and oranges are about 85 percent water, you have to eat a lot more of them to get the same number of calories.1296

People tend to eat a fairly consistent weight of food on a day-to-day basis, and serving weight is largely determined by water content.1297 The more water-rich the food, the fewer calories are being taken in overall. Higher-volume foods also take longer to eat, which slows the rate of consumption and increases “oropharyngeal stimulation,”1298 the sensation of food in our mouths and throats. The more we chew, taste, and feel food in our mouths, the more our brains get tipped off that we’re filling up. Stomach tube studies in which food bypasses the mouth show that the body has difficulty regulating appetite when we don’t experience those oral sensations.1299

Which foods have the most water? On the next page, I’ve put together a ranking for you of the water content of common foods.1300

As you can see, vegetables top the charts, with most being more than 90 percent water by weight, followed by most fruit coming in around the 80s. Starchier vegetables, whole grains, and canned beans are in the 70s, meaning about three-quarters of their weights are pure water. Pasta and most unprocessed meat, including seafood, fall down to the 60s. Most dried fruits, cheeses, and breads are in the 30s. Cake crumbles into the 20s, cookies into the teens, and candy and most common snack foods are all the way at the bottom with less than 9 percent water by weight. In general, when it comes to water-rich foods, most whole plant foods float up near the top, most animal foods fall somewhere in the middle, and most processed foods sink to the bottom.

Trapped vs. Free Water 

Can’t you just drink a few glasses of water while you eat a steak and make up for the meat’s low water content that way? If you drank ten gulps of water with every bite, wouldn’t you end up with the same 95 percent water stomach contents you’d get eating, say, cucumbers and lettuce? This scheme works for fat cats—adding water to dry kibble can help our pet cats lose weight1301—but it doesn’t seem to work for dogs.1302 So are we more like dogs or cats?

If you have people drink two glasses of water with a meal, their subjective feelings of hunger and satiety can be affected. This led researchers to suggest that drinking extra water could decrease food intake in a manner “far more simple and cheaper than installing an intragastric balloon.”1303 Drinking water with meals would certainly be safer, but it doesn’t appear to actually cut down on food intake.1304 People tend to feel fuller when they drink water with a meal, but that doesn’t appear to actually translate into eating less.1305

Why does water inside a food reduce intake, but not water alongside a food? It all just ends up in the same place, right? What appears to be happening is a phenomenon known as sieving.1306 When water is outside the food, the stomach simply siphons it off from the solid chunks and strains it right out, which leads to a rapid drop in stomach volume. On the other hand, when water is part of a food, it all forms a homogenous mass that more slowly empties from your stomach over time.1307

If you give people a casserole for lunch, they eat the same amount whether or not they’re also given a glass of water, about four hundred calories’ worth. But if that same casserole and that same water are blended into a soup, they only eat three hundred calories’ worth before feeling full.1308 You can do real-time MRI scans of people’s stomachs and witness the sieving process in action. A half hour after eating, the stomach volume remained 36 percent greater after eating the same meal in soup form.1309 Blended together, the same meal components served as a soup left people significantly fuller even three hours later.1310

Even though the soup was puréed in a blender, its thickness from all the little suspended particles prevented the stomach from separating out the water and draining it off.1311 It even works with thinner liquids.1312 If you give people a milkshake followed by a glass of water, the body is able to layer out the water and empty the stomach twice as fast than if you had preblended in the water to make a more dilute, thinner shake. This helps explain observational data showing that, compared to water consumed separately, the intake of water in foods is more closely related to a slimmer waist.

//
Does Dried Fruit Make You Gain Weight?

Some dried fruit is as dry as beef jerky. Drying concentrates the calories. Compared to dried fruit, fresh fruit gives us more volume, more weight—more food—for the same number of calories.1314 Drying also concentrates the sugars, which could drive overeating. The raisin industry is quick to point out that raisins don’t cause any more of a sugar spike than when consuming the same number of calories of grapes, but with grapes, that means eating about four times as much food.1315 On the other hand, in dried fruit, the fiber also gets more concentrated, which could potentially aid satiety. So which is it?

In population studies, those who eat dried fruit tend to be slimmer than those who don’t,1316 but they also tend to eat better diets overall. This is one reason interventional studies are so important to prove whether there’s a cause-and-effect relationship. Leave it to the California Raisin Marketing Board to dream up a study entitled “An After-School Snack of Raisins Lowers Cumulative Food Intake in Young Children.”1317 Sounds good, right? Well, what did they compare raisins to? Potato chips and chocolate chip cookies. They gave kids raisins, grapes, chips, or cookies and told them to eat as much as they wanted. Surprise, surprise, the kids ate less fruit and more junk. To be fair, I guess naming the paper “Kids Prefer Cookies” would not have garnered the same kind of sponsor approval.

Give people fresh fruit, and they end up eating less at subsequent meals. Give people strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, and they eat less pasta an hour later compared to those given the same number of calories in the form of gummy bears, which have about the same water content as raisins.1318 The same effect can be found with other kinds of fresh fruit,1319 and this can translate into greater weight loss. Give people apples or pears every day instead of the same calories in cookies, and they lose significantly more weight.1320 The only way to know if water content played the critical role, though, is if the researchers had included a third group in the study who had been given dried pears and apple rings.

There have been experiments directly comparing raisins to grapes. Although grapes appear to suppress appetite better than raisins,1321 raisins beat out grapes when it came to reducing pizza intake a half hour later. I know as parents there’s a concern that if our kids eat snacks, it might spoil their dinners, but when the snacks are fruit and the meal is “pepperoni and 3 cheese pizza,”1322 perhaps the more we can ruin their appetites, the better.

Does the satiating effect of raisins translate into weight loss, though? Prunes can also cut down on appetite1323 and subsequent meal intake,1324 but feed people about nine prunes a day and they don’t appear to lose any weight, at least in the short term (though their bowel habits did improve).1325 Similarly, replacing about four hundred to five hundred calories of someone’s diet with raisins every day may not lead to weight loss. However, you can imagine how adding the same caloric load in the form of grapes every day—four or five cups—might have more of an effect.1326 Bottom line: Although eating dried apples,1327 figs,1328 dates,1329 prunes,1330 or raisins1331 may not lead to inordinate weight gain, they don’t appear to actively promote weight loss. That makes fresh fruit the better choice.


****************************************************************************************************
LOW GLYCEMIC LOAD
Chew on This
One of the major dietary shifts from the ancient to the modern world has been the increased consumption of fiber-depleted processed carbohydrates—sugars and starches.1332 The impact of carbs on the body depends on their source. Kidney beans and jelly beans are both rich in carbs but can have diametrically different impacts on our bodies. Bread made from the exact same ingredients as pasta causes nearly twice the blood sugar spike, leading to nearly three times the insulin release as the same number of carbs consumed in noodle form.1333 That’s because bread is filled with tiny bubbles, allowing digestive enzymes easy access to more surface area to more rapidly digest starch into sugars compared to pasta, which is more compact. The more solid nature of pasta forces the enzymes to have to work their way in from the edges, slowing the rate at which pasta can be broken down.

You can try this experiment at home: Take a bite of a piece of bread, and chew, chew, and chew some more without swallowing. Gradually, that piece of bread will taste sweeter and sweeter, thanks to the starch-digesting enzyme in our saliva. Next, try it with cooked spaghetti. Sore jaw alert! It may take two hours of chewing pasta to get the same sweetness in your mouth that you’d get from chewing bread for only ten minutes. You probably won’t want to try it with the whole intact grain—wheat berries—because it might take all day.1334

Why do we care how quickly carbohydrates are digested? Because it can affect our appetites, our metabolic rates, and how much fat we burn.

You can measure the impact different carbohydrate-rich foods have by feeding people a certain amount and seeing what happens to their blood sugar levels over the next few hours. Then you can compare the size of the blood sugar bump from the carbs in bread form to the same number of carbs in pasta form, or fruit form—or cotton candy form, for that matter. This is how the glycemic index of foods is generally calculated. Then, based on the number of carbs per serving, we can come up with the glycemic load of a food. The higher the glycemic load, the higher our blood sugars tend to spike when we eat them. A breakdown of some common sweet and starchy foods appears here.


Eat low glycemic index foods
****************************************************************************************************
Lighten Your Load
If you feed people two types of meals matched for calories, nutrition, and taste, but one has a high glycemic load and the other low, what happens when you put them in a brain scanner? The high-glycemic-load meal causes significantly greater activation in the regions of the brain associated with reward and craving, along with increased hunger four hours later.1336 This may help explain why most of the top dozen problematic foods identified in a study entitled “Which Foods May Be Addictive?” were high-glycemic-load foods. (I expand on this study in the Low in Addictive Foods section.) Rather than the quantity of refined carbs, such as white flour and sugar, it was the speed at which they were absorbed in the system that was more predictive of being “addictive.”1337

What do you think happened when kids ate Corn Flakes, Coco Pops, or Rice Krispies for breakfast versus a lower-glycemic-load food like oatmeal with a spoonful of sugar? After the high-glycemic breakfast, the kids went on to eat more of a buffet-style lunch than when they had started their day eating about the same number of calories of the lower-glycemic breakfast. Even with the extra sugar added to their oatmeal, they ended up eating about one hundred fewer calories of the all-you-can-eat lunch, compared with after the high-glycemic breakfast.1338 In this case, the difference in fiber intake also could have played a role, but in general, these types of short-term satiety studies have shown that lower-glycemic carbohydrates may make one feel fuller longer.1339

Beyond appetite regulation, lower-glycemic-load foods can also cause you to burn more fat. If you feed people a low-glycemic meal (All-Bran cereal and fruit) and put them on a treadmill three hours later, they burn more fat than they would after having eaten the same number of calories of a high-glycemic meal (for example, Corn Flakes and white bread).1340 This enhanced fat loss can occur not only during brisk walking1341 or running1342 but can happen even when doing nothing.

One of the reasons it’s so hard to maintain weight loss is that our bodies try to defend themselves against losing fat by slowing down our resting metabolic rates, the number of calories our bodies burn every hour just by existing.1343 That’s one of the reasons weight loss can stall on a diet. But put people on a low-glycemic-load diet, and metabolic rate doesn’t slow down as much—their metabolisms slow by 96 calories a day after losing about twenty pounds, compared to a metabolism that is 176 calories slower on a higher-glycemic-load diet.1344 An 80-calorie-a-day difference might not seem like a lot, but those calories are burned automatically without an ounce of additional effort on our parts. Eighty calories is about how much we’d burn walking an extra mile a day (or eating about two fewer bites of a donut).

This process can work the other way too. If you overfeed people on a high-glycemic diet, then they store more fat than those eating the same number of calories of a low-glycemic diet. If you eat 50 percent more calories than needed, you add about a quarter pound of pure fat to your body each day on a high-glycemic diet. However, if you eat the same number of extra calories on a low-glycemic diet, you gain about 40 percent less,1345 which comes out to a difference of about a pound of fat a week while eating the same number of calories.


Putting Lower-Glycemic Eating to the Test
Between the satiating power and metabolic benefits of low-glycemic foods, it’s no wonder that those randomized to be given lower, rather than higher, glycemic meals appear to lose more body fat.1346,1347 What did surprise me was how underwhelming the evidence was for significant or long-term weight loss with low-glycemic-load interventions. A review prepared by the Cochrane Collaboration, historically considered to be the evidence-based gold standard, concluded that “lowering the glycaemic load of the diet appears to be an effective method of promoting weight loss” but only found the benefit to be a few extra pounds of weight loss after weeks or months on lower-glycemic-load diets.1348

The DIOGENES trial is held up by advocates of lower-glycemic eating as evidence of its efficacy.1349 Hundreds of overweight individuals were advised to eat either higher- or lower-glycemic index diets after losing an average of twenty-four pounds to see who could keep off the weight better. Those on lower-glycemic diets regained less weight at six months compared to those on the high-glycemic-index diet, but it was only two pounds less,1350 and the benefit appeared to effectively vanish by the one-year mark.1351 In retrospect, this is unsurprising given how unsuccessful they were at convincing people to change their eating habits.

Anytime findings in controlled feeding studies don’t seem to translate into real-world results, the first question you always have to ask is: Did the subjects actually follow the prescribed diet? In a controlled setting like in that metabolic rate study, the glycemic load can be dropped 70 percent, from a total daily glycemic load of 287 down to 82. In the case of the DIOGENES trial, where people were randomized not to different diets but to different dietary recommendations, the difference in daily glycemic loads between the “high” glycemic group and the “low” glycemic group differed by less than 3 percent.1352 No wonder the demonstrated benefits were slim to none. Foods only work if you eat them.

Even in the most successful studies, it’s hard to separate out the specific effects of the glycemic change. Many high-glycemic foods are highly processed and fiber-depleted, so when you swap them for low-glycemic foods like beans and fruit, you’re doing more than just changing the glycemic load. The big drop in glycemic load in the metabolic rate study was accompanied by a similar-sized boost in fiber intake—so how do we know it was the glycemic load and not the fiber?1353 That’s the problem with diet studies: It’s hard to change just one thing. With drug trials, it’s easy—just give the drug or a sugar pill and if there’s a change, you know it was the drug that caused it. If only we could stuff the change in glycemic load into a pill. Well, it turns out we can.

Acarbose is a drug that partially blocks our sugar- and starch-digesting enzymes in the digestive tract, slowing their absorption into the body.1354 When taking the drug with a meal, you can effectively transform a high-glycemic meal into a low-glycemic meal without changing the foods at all.1355 Weight-loss trials with acarbose offer the strongest case that simply lowering dietary glycemic load may indeed be beneficial for weight management.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

As you can see in the Glycemic Load Per Serving chart, the simplest way to stick to a lower-glycemic diet is to try to stick to foods that were grown, not made. If you are going to eat high-glycemic foods, though, there are ways to help blunt the blood sugar spikes. I explore a few options in part IV, where I cover a series of weight-loss boosters, including the use of vinegar in the Amping AMPK section and choosing intact grains over whole ones in the Wall Off Your Calories section.

You can also eat berries with your meals, which can act as starch blockers by inhibiting the enzyme that digests starch.1358 This slows the absorption of blood sugars into your system. So, if you are going to sit down to a high-glycemic breakfast, put a raspberry spread on your toast, add strawberries on your cornflakes, or make your pancakes blueberry, for example, to help mediate the glycemic rush.

Some starch is naturally resistant to digestion. Prior to the discovery of this “resistant starch” in 1982, we thought all starch could be broken down by the enzymes in our small intestines.1359 Now we know there are indeed starches that resist digestion, which not only lowers their glycemic impact but, since they make their way down to our large intestines, can act as prebiotics to feed our good bacteria, just like fiber does. (Probiotics are live bacteria; prebiotics are the fuel that feeds them.) Resistant starch is found naturally in many common foods, including beans, grains, vegetables, seeds, and some nuts—but in small quantities, just a few percent of the total.1360 There are ways, though, to get more resistant starch into your diet.

When regular starches are cooked and then cooled, some of the starch recrystallizes into resistant starch. For this reason, pasta salad can be a bit healthier than hot pasta, and potato salad sometimes healthier than a baked potato. But the effect isn’t huge. The resistant starch goes from about 3 percent up to 4 percent. So rather than relying on cold starches, the best source of resistant starch is legumes—beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils—which start out at 4–5 percent and then go up from there.1

LOW IN ADDED FAT
The Fat Wars
Dueling Time magazine covers, one depicting an egg-and-bacon frowny face and another exhorting people to eat butter, exemplify the two battlefronts in the contentious issue of dietary fat’s role in disease. On one side, all sources of fat are villainized, while on the other, lard is lauded. As is so often the case with fervent partisan positions, both could stand a dose of science.

A common trope of the pro-fat faction is that the obesity epidemic was fueled by government calls to reduce fat intake. This presupposes the American public actually followed that advice. In fact, fat intake has not fallen; it’s gone from an estimated average of 743 daily calories of fat in the 1970s to 747 in the latest national survey.1362 The availability of added fats and oils rose more than 50 percent, from 52.5 pounds per person in 1970 to 82.2 in 2010.1363 America presumably got fat because we ate more of everything—more carbs, more protein, and more fat.1364 We now eat about 500 more calories every day and gained about an extra 500-calories-a-day’s worth of weight.1365 So there’s no great mystery there.

The percentage of calories from fat decreased from about 37 percent to 34 percent, but that’s just because the increase in carbs and protein exceeded the increase in fat. At no time in recent history has America eaten a low-fat diet.1366 The pro-fat faction is right about one thing, though: The food industry’s response to the call to reduce fat may have made things worse.

The low-fat diet recommendation, as proposed in the original Dietary Goals for the United States, was intended, for example, to “decrease consumption of meat”1367 and increase consumption of naturally low-fat foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.1368 But how much money can be made on millet? Not nearly as much as bastardized “low-fat” junk foods. Enter SnackWell’s Fat-Free Devil’s Food Cookie Cakes.

The packaged-food industry is happy to hop on any bandwagon and sell us any kind of junk food we want: low-fat junk, low-carb junk, gluten-free organic junk, and even, ironically, processed paleo junk. But low-fat doesn’t necessarily mean low-calorie.1369 A systematic comparison of different foods and their low-fat versions found that items with reduced-fat claims tend to have more sugar.1370 Instead, we can dismount the processed food industry’s sugar-fat seesaw by opting for whole, natural foods.

Researchers have shown that overfeeding people with either fat or sugar can cause the same weight gain.1371 The debate is often framed as fat versus carbs, but health-wise, the term carbs is practically meaningless, as it could refer to black beans or Blow Pops. If, for weight loss, you replace fatty foods in people’s diets with sugary foods, nothing happens, but if you replace fatty foods with starchy foods, they lose weight.1372 Presumably, this is because the researchers started feeding people more real food (as inferred by increased fiber intake), rather than just processed foods with either added fats or added sugar.


****************************************************************************************************
The Halo Effect
Akin to the way people evidently tend to start doing more laundry when they get energy-efficient washing machines and thereby undercut their savings,1373 low-fat claims can lead consumers to eat larger portions and take in more calories.1374 When M&M’s candies were labeled as “low-fat,” for example, overweight study participants ate 47 percent more of them.1375 Consumers tend to overgeneralize specific claims and arrive at overreaching conclusions. Many people see the words low fat and assume that means the product is healthy overall.

Taken from the social psychology literature, the halo effect theory helps explain these types of leaps. Positive personality traits, for example, are inexplicably attributed to people who are more physically attractive.1376 Cereals use this ploy all the time with nutrient-specific claims like “good source of vitamin D.” Lucky Charms can produce a positive “health halo” impression to distract the purchaser from the incongruity of feeding their children multicolored marshmallows for breakfast.

Deliberately distracting attention away from negative qualities or the overall vacuity of nutritional content has a name: nutri-washing.1377 Ironically, cereal boxes bearing low-calorie claims have been found to have more calories on average than those not asserting to be low-calorie, so nutrient claims can be misleading even when understood correctly.1378

Food, not nutrients, is the fundamental unit in nutrition.1379 The source of fat is likely more important than the amount of fat. And let’s not forget that the healthiest foods don’t have any nutrition labeling on them at all. In the grocery store, you’re more likely to see “healthy” claims adorn Apple Jacks than apples.


****************************************************************************************************
A Big Fat Low-Fat Fail?
To define low fat, you first need to figure out what a normal-fat diet is. Not surprisingly, the “normal” intake of dietary fat varies widely by cultural cuisine around the world, from 6 percent of calories on the traditional Okinawan diet1395 to 66 percent among indigenous Arctic people.1396 But what’s normal for us as a species?

For millions of years, we may have evolved getting approximately 10 percent of our calories from fat.1397 There was no butter or oil, nuts were trapped inside hard shells, and animals hadn’t yet been bred to be extra juicy. The flesh of some wild game, like moose and elk, is less than 2 percent fat by weight and less than 15 percent calories from fat.1398 Even the “lean” ground beef of today can have nearly half of its calories from fat.1399 What about “extra lean”? That comes in at 28 percent fat calories,1400 which is about double that of the extra, extra, extra lean meat of many wild animals eaten by our ancestors.

Some low-fat proponents have used our evolutionary legacy to support their case. After all, the argument goes, what’s the ideal fuel for a motor? The fuel it was designed and built for.1401 Our metabolic physiology was essentially genetically programmed by our ancestral fat intake, but just because 10 percent fat may be normal doesn’t mean it’s best. Natural selection is more about getting us to reproductive age intact than it is about optimal health and longevity. So while we may not be able to use our prehistoric diets to argue for the ideal, we can use them to define normalcy for our species.

It’s been argued that for about 99.8 percent of our time on Earth, it was virtually impossible for us to regularly consume more than 15 percent of calories as fat.1402 If it’s the case that 10 percent is a normal fat intake for humans, less than 10 percent could be defined as low-fat. Given that context, let’s review the five studies I could find that purported to show “low-fat” diets failed.

One study published in The New England Journal of Medicine claimed to put people on a low-fat diet, but their fat intakes didn’t budge significantly, drifting only from 31 percent fat to 30 percent fat.1403 The “low-fat” groups in three other studies also ended up at 30 percent fat, far from actually being low in fat.1404,1405,1406 A study in Tehran did claim that a 30 percent fat group beat out a 20 percent fat group for weight loss, but the lower-fat group had zero change in fiber intake and no significant change in protein, saturated fat, or cholesterol consumption.1407 To get a bump in fiber-depleted carb intake without adding fruits, vegetables, whole grains, or beans, or without removing meat and dairy would presumably mean giving people the Iranian equivalent of SnackWell’s. Regardless, even 20 percent fat may be high by evolutionary standards.

So if 10 percent of calories from fat is normal for us as a species and less than that can be considered to be low-fat, why are these studies of so-called low-fat diets allowing double and even triple that? You can’t tell if a low-fat diet works unless you test a diet that’s actually low in fat.

****************************************************************************************************
You Can’t Win If You Don’t Play
If you put people on a specific diet and nothing happens, then either the diet didn’t work or the people didn’t follow it. Adherence to prescribed diets in weight-loss studies is poor even when researchers provide all the meals1408 and truly abysmal when the subjects are left to fend for themselves.1409 Just as medications never work if you don’t take them, diets don’t work if you don’t eat them.

The accompanying editorial to a meta-analysis of “low-fat” weight-loss studies that showed little to no benefit was entitled “Prescribing Low-Fat Diets: Useless for Long-Term Weight Loss?”1410—with the key word prescribing. One could imagine a similar editorial called “Prescribing Smoking Cessation: Useless for Preventing Lung Cancer?” because the failure rate of physician advice to quit smoking is 98 percent.1411 It’s not that quitting smoking doesn’t help; it’s just that people often don’t comply. If smokers are able to stop, they can see dramatic improvement in their health, but it may take them an average of thirty attempts to quit before they’re successful and stop lighting up.1412 Even with a dismal 2 percent success rate, we physicians are still urged to advise our patients to stop smoking because we know it works if they actually do it. Is that the same with low-fat diets? You don’t know until you put actual low-fat diets to the test.

In a remarkable study out of Hawaii that I detail further here and here, subjects achieved seventeen pounds of weight loss in twenty-one days eating unlimited quantities of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans.1413 That diet was 7 percent fat, similar to the traditional Okinawan diet. But what about longer term? Some of the heart disease reversal studies got people’s diets down to 10 percent of fat or less, which can lead unintentionally to a sixteen-pound weight loss in three months.1414

In the famous Lifestyle Heart Trial, Dr. Dean Ornish motivated people to reduce their fat intakes to 6 percent with a diet centered on whole plant foods for a year.1415 The participants were also told to exercise, but they failed to become any more significantly active than the control group. Even though weight loss wasn’t the intention of the study and people could eat as much as they wanted, by the end of the year, those randomized to the low-fat lifestyle intervention got a twenty-four-pound weight loss as a side benefit to reversing their heart disease. At five years, their fat intakes were still low at 9 percent and they had sustained a thirteen-pound weight loss.


//
The More the Merrier
Is it possible to lower fat intake yet still achieve weight loss even when there is no restriction on portion sizes, no conscious effort to cut calories, and unlimited opportunities to eat? Yes. People lose weight on low-fat diets not because they are eating less but because they are eating more. In the Hawaii study, the subjects lost seventeen pounds in three weeks because their caloric intakes dropped 40 percent. If you were to do that with caloric restriction, you’d have to cut the amount of food you ate nearly in half, but the Hawaiians ate more food—in excess of four pounds of food a day.1428 Natural, low-fat foods tend to be so calorie dilute—that is, have so few calories per bite—that eating the same amount of food inevitably leads to fewer calories. The same, of course, cannot be said of fat-free cookies.

This calorie-density mechanism of low-fat-diet weight loss was illustrated by an elegant study from my medical alma mater, Tufts. Research subjects were switched from a more conventional diet of 35 percent calories from fat down to a diet getting only 15 percent of its calories from fat, but they were forced to eat so much food that they didn’t lose any weight. Their weights were monitored closely, and if they started to lose weight, they were made to eat more food. The subjects had to eat more than five pounds of food a day to maintain their weights and “frequently complained of abdominal fullness.” Then, after five or six weeks, they were kept on the same 15 percent fat diet but were allowed to eat however much they wanted, the amount of food with which they were comfortable. Over the next ten to twelve weeks, they lost an average of eight pounds. They weren’t told to purposely lose weight. They just couldn’t help it.1429

Normally on a diet, if quantity limits are suddenly removed, you gain weight. But on a low-enough-fat diet, even when most people can eat as much as they want, they lose weight. It doesn’t happen for everybody, though. One guy in the Tufts study actually gained weight in the free-feeding phase, and another, who must have gotten used to eating that much more food, stayed the same. But the other twenty-seven out of twenty-nine participants lost weight, one as much as twenty-nine pounds, all eating ad libitum, which is Latin for at one’s pleasure. That’s where the term ad lib comes from. In acting, it means going off script. In nutrition research, it means eating without limits on quantity.

****************************************************************************************************
It isn’t hard to imagine how ad libitum diets might be superior for long-term weight maintenance. To test this, researchers had people lose twenty-eight pounds through a combination of drugs and severe caloric restriction. They then randomized the subjects to an ad libitum low-fat diet or a food exchange–based calorie-counting system to restrict caloric intake to see which group was better able to keep off the weight. One year later, the weight loss was three times higher in the ad libitum group, and they were about 50 percent more likely to maintain a substantial portion of their initial lost weights.1430 

# In the short term, most people can force themselves to cut down on the amount of food they eat, but for lifelong weight loss, eating as much as you want may be more sustainable.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Too Little, Too Late
Give people all-you-can-eat buffets of lower-fat foods, and they end up eating hundreds of fewer calories a day than if the buffets contained similar foods containing more fat.1431 Depending on the fat content of the food, this can then translate into weight loss (at 15–20 percent fat) or weight gain (at 45–50 percent fat).1432 Researchers offered people essentially the same foods, but with some slight tweaks, such as more or less oil, butterfat, or margarine slipped in. The foods evidently looked and tasted about the same, so people ate about the same amount and spontaneously lost or gained weight depending on the fat content. This is the passive consumption I explore here, an artifact of calorie density.1433 It’s not the fat per se but rather the consequent increase in calories per mouthful because fat can sneak lots of calories into a relatively small space.1434 However, there may actually be a difference in the appetite feedback loop between fat calories and carb calories.

If I hooked you up to an IV and, unbeknownst to you, dripped 1,300 calories of sugar into your veins, studies show your body somehow “tastes” how sweet your blood has become, does the math, and turns down your appetite so much that you spontaneously eat about 1,100 fewer calories that day.1435 That’s a huge drop in intake, but your body sensed all those extra calories in your system and made you that much less hungry to compensate. Genius!

But if I repeat the experiment with fat, we get a different result. Have 1,300 calories of fat secretly infused into your veins, and your body knows something is going on but doesn’t quite get the same picture as it did when you got those extra calories from sugar. So you only end up compensating by eating about 500 fewer calories that day.1436 Your body just doesn’t seem to register fat calories as well as sugar calories. You can demonstrate this with food too.

If you give people a breakfast of yogurt with a few hundred extra calories of sugar mixed in, they eat significantly less of a meal offered ninety minutes later than they do when their morning yogurt doesn’t have the added sugar. Not enough to account for all the extra sugar, mind you, but at least their bodies are trying to compensate. But when they’re given the same number of extra calories in fat rather than sugar, there is no effect on subsequent meal intake; in fact, they eat a little more.1437 The fat just didn’t seem to induce the same braking effect on their appetites, or at least not in time.

So perhaps our bodies aren’t so smart after all? They can only be as smart in the context in which they were designed. Snake a tube down someone’s throat and secretly squirt some fat straight into their intestines, and their hunger can be slashed abruptly.1438 Our bodies successfully sense the fat in our intestines and turn down our appetites. The problem is it happens too late. By the time high-fat foods make it through our stomachs and hit our intestines, we’re usually already done eating. So what good are our bodies’ detection mechanisms? Well, what kinds of high-fat foods were around during the millions of years our whole system was first evolving? Nuts. How fast can you eat walnuts in a shell? Even with a nutcracker in hand, it’s slow going. So, in a natural context, our bodies can pick up on the fact we just stumbled on some nuts and make sure we don’t overeat, but by the time our bodies sense we just ate that fat-infused yogurt or a donut, it’s too late. We’ve already swallowed the last bite.

Dumping More Calories
So far, we’ve only talked about the calories-in side of the equation—how higher fat intakes can unintentionally lead to higher caloric intakes. When you think of calories out, expending energy, you likely think exercise, but the majority of the calories most of us burn is just from existing. That’s what’s called the resting metabolic rate, how many calories we burn every hour just to keep our hearts pumping and everything working. For most people, that’s around 65 percent of the calories we burn every day.1439 Another 25 percent is from movement, and the final 10 percent is the thermic effect of food, meaning the calories it takes for us to digest what we consume. Interestingly, what we eat not only constitutes calories in but also can affect all three of these dimensions of calories out.

Eat a low-fat diet (11 percent calories from fat), and you burn more calories in your sleep than when on a high-fat diet (58 percent).1440 The difference could be as much as sixty-five calories a night, though measurements in this study were taken during overfeeding, which would be expected to exaggerate the effect. People on lower-fat diets may inexplicably start to move more too. Those randomized to a 20 percent fat diet started exercising more, expending eighty-three more calories a day on physical activity, whereas the group randomized to the 40 percent fat group started expending fifty-nine fewer calories a day.1441 Between them, that’s a difference of about a two-mile walk a day.1442 This may help explain why those on the higher-fat diet lost significantly more lean body mass, down three pounds in six months compared to a gain in lean mass in the lower-fat group.1443

At rest, we burn about one calorie a minute, which is comparable to the heat produced by a seventy-five-watt light bulb. After meals, that bulb burns a little brighter to handle what we just ate.1444 Fat also appears to be absorbed more efficiently from the digestive tract, meaning it takes fewer calories to process it.1445 A really low-fat diet (3 percent of calories from fat) costs about 65 percent more calories to digest than a high-fat diet (40 percent fat), so, in effect, you’re doing more work just by eating low-fat, though the benefit may only come out to be about forty calories a day.1446

In addition to the three primary components of calories out, there’s actually a fourth component, and it’s much more literal: the calories we poop out. Those eating low-fat appear to flush more calories down the toilet. Overeating on an 11-percent-calories-from-fat diet led to 620 more calories down the toilet every week than a same-calorie diet containing 58 percent calories from fat.1447 That’s nearly 2,500 fewer calories a month available for building up fat. Though calories in is the more important side of the equation, all these little benefits on the other side may add up to greater weight loss over time.

****************************************************************************************************
The Fat You Eat Is the Fat You Bear
In the Vermont prison studies I mentioned earlier where lean “volunteers” were overfed to study experimental obesity, the researchers made an important discovery: They learned how difficult it is to get people to gain weight on purpose—unless you feed them lots of fat. To get prisoners to gain thirty pounds on a mixed diet, it took about 140,000 excess calories per a certain body surface area. To get the same thirty-pound weight gain just by adding fat to their diets, all the researchers had to do was feed the prisoners as few as 40,000 extra calories.1448 When the extra calories were in the form of straight fat, it took as many as 100,000 fewer calories to gain the same amount of weight. Why? Isn’t a calorie a calorie? Why are our bodies so much more efficient at storing fat calories?

The reason our bodies so easily store fat as fat is because it’s already fat. Our bodies can turn protein or carbs into fat, but it’s costly. To store one hundred calories of dietary fat as body fat, it only takes three calories of energy, but converting one hundred calories of dietary carbs into fat for storage takes twenty-three calories.1449 So, if your body wanted to store the fat from one hundred pats of butter, it would have to essentially burn three pats to make it happen, so you’d end up only storing ninety-seven pats. But in order to store one hundred sugar cubes as fat, the conversion process alone would burn up nearly a quarter of them. This is why our bodies would rather burn carbs and store fat instead of the other way around. Simply stated, fat may be more fattening.1450

When we eat a meal, most of the fat is deposited directly as fat on our bodies, whereas a large proportion of the carbs get stored in our muscles for quick energy.1451 A study on children found that a high-fat meal deposited nine times more fat onto their bodies than the same number of calories of a low-fat meal.1452 Where exactly does the fat go? Researchers at the Mayo Clinic tagged the fat in a meal with special isotopes to track its movement throughout the body. They had research subjects eat the tagged fat and then, twenty-four hours later, brought them into the operating room and took fat biopsies from their thighs, belly flab, and deep within their abdomens. Of the fat in the meal they could account for, about 45 percent was burned right off the bat, but most of the fat consumed was simply directed right into their fat stores. The researchers found that about 50 percent went straight into belly flab, 40 percent to their thighs, and most of the remaining went into visceral fat, the fat that’s buried around our major organs.1453 Under normal circumstances, less than 1 percent of ingested carbohydrates suffers the same fate based on similar studies of isotope-labeled sugar.1454

Low-fat proponents often point out this fact, that making significant amounts of new fat from scratch from ingested carbs only occurs with “massive overfeeding”1455 of, for example, a “diet consisted of candy.”1456 If you feed people an extra thousand calories of sugar a day, the equivalent of up to eleven bags of cotton candy,1457 they do gain about four pounds in three weeks,1458 but most of the extra carb calories end up being burned off as excess heat.1459 If, however, you added an extra thousand calories of fat, like a stick or so of butter every day or a half cup of oil, most of that would be directly socked away and stored for a rainy day.1460

Under more normal circumstances, even if less than 1 percent of the carbs in a meal end up as fat, that doesn’t mean that carbs can’t be fattening. Normally, our bodies burn fat around the clock at, interestingly, about the rate at which a candle burns. (Candles, after all, used to be made from animal fat.1461) Carbohydrates are the body’s preferred fuel, so when we eat them, our bodies switch from burning fat to burning carbs, effectively snuffing out the candle for a few hours. So, while we can certainly gain weight from eating carbs, it’s more from sparing our own fat from being used, rather than adding more fat directly.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Is All Fat Just as Fattening?
If you were surprised to learn that, in some ways, fat calories are handled differently by the body from how carbohydrate calories are, you may be really surprised by the data suggesting that some types of fat calories are more fattening than others. I certainly was. There have long been studies linking greater saturated fat intake specifically with greater weight gain,1463 but I always assumed it was just because it was a marker for poorer diets and lifestyles in general. After all, the top five sources of saturated fat in the United States are essentially cheese, desserts like cake and ice cream, chicken, pork, and then burgers.1464

Interventional studies started to make things more interesting. If you switch people from a 38-percent-calories-from-fat diet down to a 28-percent-calories-from-fat diet, they lose body fat. Nothing too surprising there. But if you switch people from a 38-percent-fat diet of mostly saturated fat to a 38-percent-fat diet of mostly monounsaturated fat, like that of a more Mediterranean diet, they also lose body fat.1465 The same number of calories and the same amount of fat—but a different type of fat—meant a different degree of weight loss.

One way researchers have switched people from a diet rich in saturated fat to a more Mediterranean diet is to swap out some meat and dairy for nuts and avocados. In this way, they would be eating the same amount of fat and calories, but suddenly, they’d also be eating significantly more fiber.1466 In that case, when they lose more weight, how do you know it was the change in fat quality rather than the change in fiber quantity?

To determine if there’s really a difference between fats, researchers designed a study where people ate essentially the same foods—different only by the kind of fat. They baked scones. Half were made with sunflower oil, and the other half with butter. The liver fat in the sunflower scone eaters went down, while the liver fat in the butter scone eaters went up.1467

Is it possible it was less unsaturated fat versus saturated fat, and more plant fat versus animal fat? Dietary cholesterol may be one of the main factors associated with liver injury and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,1468 which helps explain why those who eat even just a few eggs a week were found to have more than triple the odds of fatty liver disease.1469 So how could you separate out that factor?

Researchers designed a study where people ate essentially the same foods, but, this time, different only by saturated versus unsaturated fat. Instead of scones, this time they baked muffins. Half were made with sunflower oil, and the other half with palm oil, a fat that is saturated, but, like all plant fats, free of cholesterol. Not only did the palm oil muffins result in significantly greater liver and total body fat, they produced twice as much visceral fat, the particularly harmful fat wrapped around our internal organs.1470 On the saturated-fat diet, they also gained four times as much fat as lean tissue.1471 So saturated plant fats like coconut oil not only join animal fats in increasing heart disease risk1472 but may also play a role in the obesity epidemic.

One reason saturated fats may be more fattening is that they appear more likely to be stored immediately rather than burned. This was found in comparisons to both monounsaturated fats (in a match between olive oil and cream)1473 and polyunsaturated fats (in a match between mostly safflower oil and lard).1474 Oleic acid, the primary monounsaturated fat found in olives, nuts, and avocados, is burned promptly about 20 percent more readily than palmitic acid,1475 the predominant saturated fat in the American diet, which is sourced mainly from meat and dairy.1476 You can drip palmitic acid on muscle cells in a petri dish and openly demonstrate the suppression of fat utilization.1477 But this difference is too small to account for the pounds of extra weight lost when these fats are switched in randomized controlled studies.

In the five hours following a breakfast with about four teaspoons of olive oil, research subjects burned about sixteen grams of fat.1478 In the same five-hour period after eating essentially the same breakfast, but with the olive oil replaced with butterfat, only about thirteen grams of fat were burned. A pound of fat is 454 grams, so even if you burned 3 more grams of fat at every single meal, at the end of the month, you might only end up about a half pound lighter. But in a study where saturated fat was swapped for the same amount of mostly olive oil, people lost five pounds of fat in a month.1479 Something else has to be going on.

Remember that thermic effect of food, the amount of energy spent digesting, absorbing, and storing a meal? Well, it apparently costs 28 percent more calories to process a meal containing walnuts and 23 percent more calories to process a meal containing olive oil than it does to process a meal with the same number of calories and fat but in the form of cheese and butter.1480 That sounds like a lot, but our bodies are so efficient either way that it doesn’t add up to much—maybe as few as twenty or so calories a day.1481 A similar increase of a few calories a day in resting metabolic rate has been noted in a trial comparing hazelnut oil to palm oil,1482 but, again, there appears to be a missing piece.

****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Solving the Mystery of the Missing Calories
How can people lose five pounds of body fat in a month eating the same number of calories? Well, if calories in are the same, then it must be calories out. If you remember, there are four main components to calories out: resting metabolic rate, physical activity, the thermic effect of food, and fecal losses. We already determined the differences in resting metabolic rate and the thermic effect are insufficient, and there does not appear to be a difference in fecal losses between saturated and unsaturated fats.1495 That just leaves one other outlet: exercise.

How could a different type of fat make people exercise more? Early studies offered a clue. Those randomized to meals with fat from olives, nuts, and avocados tended to feel significantly “more energetic” than those getting the same amount of fat from meat and dairy, suggesting the weight loss they experienced could have been “enhanced by subtle, unconscious, increases in physical activity.”1496 You don’t know, of course, until you put it to the test.

Twenty-nine people were covertly randomized to one of two diets that appeared identical but featured different oil blends, one with palm oil and one with hazelnut oil. Same calories, same amount of fat, same diets, but the palm oil group was secretly slipped saturated fat in place of monounsaturated fat. Researchers then attached activity monitors on all the subjects to objectively measure how much they were moving. The study found that 90 percent of the subjects inexplicably ramped up their exercise when they were unwittingly eating the low-saturated-fat diet, increasing their activity levels 12–15 percent on average. The researchers concluded that a high intake of saturated fat “might dampen motivation for physical activity.”

//
Sugarcoated Science
At least a dozen interventional studies document adverse metabolic effects of consuming added sugars, though this may be due largely to the accompanying weight gain spurred by sugar consumption.1506 This has led sugar industry spokespersons, like the head of the World Sugar Research Organisation, to say things like “overconsumption of anything is harmful, including of water and air.”1507 Yes, he compared the overconsumption of sugar to breathing too much.

This is a throwback to the well-worn tobacco industry script: They’re simply providing choices; they don’t condone the overuse of their products; and, if people fall ill after consuming it, the victims can only blame themselves.1508 The reason this is disingenuous, of course, is that the tobacco industry works day and night to make their products as addictive as possible, just as the manufacturers of ultraprocessed foods like sugary breakfast cereals engineer their products to be as hyperpalatable as possible to maximize consumption.1509

Why won’t cereal manufacturers reduce the amount of sugar in their products? A number of explanations have been offered, such as “a product with semi-addictive properties may be a safe way to ensure long-term revenues.… Another possibility is that selling cereals high in sugar is a smart technique to sell expansively a cheap commodity product—sugar.”1510 Ultraprocessed foods like breakfast cereals1511 tend to have the highest profit margins.1512 Remarkably, the cost of packaging may outweigh the cost of ingredients in a cereal box by more than ten to one.1513

Denying evidence that sugars are harmful to health seems always to have been at the heart of the sugar industry’s defense.1514 When the evidence is undeniable, though—like the link between sugar and cavities1515—the industry switches from denial to deflection, such as trying to refocus attention away from restricting intake to finding a vaccine against tooth decay. We seem to have reached a similar point with obesity, as the Sugar Bureau again dodges denial and rushes to deflect. It commissioned research suggesting losing weight was useless for extending life among “healthy” obese individuals1516—a stance strongly contradicted by hundreds of studies across four continents involving more than ten million participants.

Not Sweet Nothings

On April Fools’ Day 1998, the FDA announced its approval of the artificial sweetener sucralose,1534 sold as Splenda, aka 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-β-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-α-D-galactopyranoside.1535 Despite its scary-sounding chemical name, the worst thing about it seemed to be that it was a rare migraine trigger in susceptible individuals,1536 to which the manufacturer of sucralose responded that you have to weigh whatever risk there may be against the “broader benefits,” such as “helping to mitigate the health risks associated with the national epidemic of obesity.”1537

How’s that going?

Large-scale population studies have found that the consumption of artificial sweeteners, particularly in diet sodas, is associated with increased weight gain and abdominal fat over time.1538 Now, the obvious explanation for this finding would be reverse causation: Instead of drinking more diet soda leading to obesity, it would make more sense that obesity leads to drinking more diet soda. But even when researchers controlled for preexisting differences in body fat, they still found evidence of increased obesity risk.1539

However, not all reviews of the science concluded there was a link between artificial sweeteners and weight gain. Can you guess which ones? An analysis of industry bias found that reviews funded by the food industry were seventeen times less likely to suggest unfavorable effects, and in nearly half of the sponsored reviews, the authors failed to even disclose their conflicts of interest.1540 That’s even worse than the sugar industry, whose studies were “only” five times as likely to question the link between sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity.1541 You don’t really know, though, until you put them to the test.

Ironically, many of the interventional studies on artificial sweeteners and weight gain were executed by animal agribusiness, feeding them to farm animals to fatten them faster.1542 (Is there anything they won’t feed to chickens?) Animal agriculture has been feeding artificial sweeteners to farm animals since the 1950s,1543 boasting their addition “increases … body weight gain and … optimizes return on investment.”1544 What about in people?

If you give obese individuals the amount of sucralose found in a can of diet soda, for example, they get significantly higher blood sugar and insulin spikes in response to a sugar challenge, suggesting sucralose is not just an inert substance.1545 The Splenda company emphasizes that sucralose is hardly even absorbed into the body and ends up in the colon to be eliminated.1546 Therein may lie the problem.1547 The adverse metabolic effects of artificial sweeteners correlate with “pronounced” changes in the microbiome that occur within a week of daily consumption.1548

The good news is that after stopping artificial sweeteners, your original balance of gut bacteria can be restored within a matter of weeks.1549 The problem is that we may be exposed without even knowing it. Nearly half of study participants randomized to avoid sucralose, for example, still turned up positive, thought to be due to exposure from nondietary sources, such as toothpaste and mouthwash.1550

Another way artificial sweeteners can lead to metabolic disturbance is via the disconnect that develops between the amount of sweetness the brain tastes on the tongue and how much blood sugar actually ends up reaching the brain. Your brain may end up feeling cheated by the artificial sweeteners, figuring you have to consume more and more sweetness in order to get enough calories.1551 For example, researchers slipped people either Sprite, Sprite Zero (a no-calorie, artificially sweetened Sprite), or unsweetened, carbonated lemon-lime water, and then, later on, offered them a choice: They could have M&M’s, spring water, or sugar-free gum. Guess who picked the M&M’s? Those who drank the artificially sweetened soda were nearly three times more likely to take the candy than either those who had consumed the sugar-sweetened soda or the unsweetened drink.1552 So it wasn’t a matter of sweet versus nonsweet or even calories versus no calories. There appeared to be something about noncaloric sweeteners that tricks the brain into wanting more junk.

The same researchers performed another study in which everyone was given Oreos and then asked how satisfied the cookies made them feel. Again, those who had drunk the artificially sweetened Sprite Zero reported feeling less satisfied after eating the Oreos than either the subjects who had had normal Sprite or sparkling water. These results are consistent with brain imaging studies demonstrating that regular consumption of artificial sweeteners can alter the reward pathways responsible for the pleasurable response to food.1553

What about the natural, plant-based sweeteners derived from stevia and monk fruit? Researchers randomized people to drink a beverage sweetened with sugar, aspartame, monk fruit, or stevia. Blood sugars were measured over twenty-four hours, and surprisingly, there was no significant difference found among any of the four groups.1554

Wait a second. The sugar group was given sixteen spoonfuls of sugar, the amount in a twenty-ounce bottle of Coke, so the other three groups consumed sixteen fewer spoonfuls of sugar—yet all four groups still had the same average blood sugars? How is that possible? Table sugar causes a big blood sugar spike. Drink that bottle of sugar water with its twenty sugar cubes’ worth of sugar, and your blood sugars jump forty points over the next hour. In contrast, after drinking a beverage sweetened with aspartame, monk fruit, or stevia, nothing happens to blood sugars, which is what we would expect. These are noncaloric sweeteners. Since they have no calories, isn’t it just like drinking water? How could our daily blood sugar values average out the same? The only way that could happen is if the noncalorie sweeteners somehow made our blood sugar spikes worse later in the day—and that’s exactly what happened. In the group who drank the aspartame-sweetened beverage, even though their blood sugars didn’t rise at the time, they shot up higher an hour later in response to lunch, as if they had just consumed a bottle of soda.1555

That was for an artificial sweetener, though. What about the natural sweeteners, stevia and monk fruit? The same thing happened. The same exaggerated blood sugar spike to a regular meal occurred an hour later. So that’s how it all equals out in terms of average blood sugars even though, in these three noncaloric sweetener groups, the subjects took in sixteen fewer spoonfuls of sugar. This is at least partly because they ate more. After drinking a Diet Coke, you’re more likely to eat more at your next meal than you would if you had drunk a regular Coke. In fact, you’d eat so much more that the calories “saved” from replacing sugar with noncaloric sweeteners would be fully compensated at subsequent meals, resulting in no difference in total daily caloric intake. It’s as if the zero-calorie sweetener groups—whether sweetened artificially or naturally—had chugged a bottle of sugary soda. So, when it comes to caloric intake, blood sugars, or insulin spikes, all the other sweeteners appeared just as bad as straight sugar.1556

Do we have direct evidence that diet beverages can adversely impact body weight? Yes. If you swap out diet beverages for water, there theoretically should be no difference in weight control since they both provide zero calories, right? Well, when researchers put it to the test, overweight and obese individuals on a diet randomized to replace diet beverages with water lost significantly more weight, about 15 percent more over six months.1557,1558

The researchers who demonstrated artificial sweeteners can disrupt our microbiomes and metabolisms recognized the irony of their findings. Though these food additives were introduced to reduce caloric intake and counter the obesity epidemic, they noted their findings suggest artificial sweeteners may have instead “directly contributed to enhancing the exact epidemic that they themselves were intended to fight.”

Long in the (Sweet) Tooth
The industry is quick to point out that a calorie is a calorie, and an excess of calories from Coca-Cola would cause no more weight gain than the same excess of calories from carrots.1560 While this may be true in a tightly controlled laboratory setting,1561 it doesn’t take into account the appetite-enhancing effects of sugar.1562 Remember the experiment where children were alternately offered high- or lower-sugar cereals? As I mentioned here, surprisingly, Cheerios has a similar number of calories to Froot Loops (104 calories per cup1563 versus 110,1564 respectively). Had the kids eaten more Cheerios than Froot Loops, they could have gotten more calories, but the opposite happened. On average, the children poured and ate 77 percent more of the sugary cereals. So even with comparable calorie counts per serving, sugary cereals may end up nearly doubling caloric intake.1565

Millions of years of evolution have genetically hardwired us with both an innate liking of the sweet taste of ripe fruit 1566 and a sugar-induced subversion of some of our satiety mechanisms.1567 When we eat, desire for salty, fatty, and savory tastes diminishes as we slake our hunger, whereas our desire for sweetness is maintained.1568 This makes sense. Because fruit is sporadic and seasonal, an overfeeding response upon discovering a berry bush would have triggered our hunter-gatherer ancestors to eat as much as possible to store energy for later.1569 This may explain why we seem to grow a “second stomach” when it comes to dessert. Children may be especially vulnerable since they have a stronger preference for sweet foods than adults,1570 and repeated exposures to sugary foods may accustom young children to a lifelong habit of consuming overly sweet foods.1571

In recent years, much has been learned about the reinforcing effects of sugar and how it can promote overeating.1572 Evidence supports the thinking that we don’t just overeat sugar because we like its sweet taste.1573 As I note in the Low in Addictive Foods section, innovations in brain scanning technology have shown that the pleasure-generating reward circuitry in our brains overlaps with the neurocircuitry that mediates the addictive properties of drugs like alcohol and opioids. Sugar consumption has also been shown to inhibit anxiety-induced cortisol (stress hormone) secretion, helping to explain why many “comfort foods” are high in sugar and also why excessive sugar consumption may be such a difficult habit to break.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Note that none of these recommendations to cut down on added sugars applies to fruit. As you’ll read in the Rich in Fruits and Vegetables section, fruit can actually facilitate weight loss. If you randomize people to a diet low in all sugars, even the naturally occurring sugars in fruit, they do worse than those randomized to just cut down added sugars. Those who retained fruit in their diets lost nearly 50 percent more weight.1597

For those of you who have a sweet tooth like I do, all hope is not lost. The same palate-changing effects on your taste thermostat found after cutting down on salt and fat also work with cutting down on sugar. Put people on a sugar-free challenge for two weeks, removing all added sugars and artificial sweeteners, and by the end of the trial, up to 95 percent said “sweet foods and drinks tasted sweeter or too sweet, and … said moving forward they would use less or even no sugar.”1598 Most stopped craving sugar within the first week.

LOW IN ADDICTIVE FOODS
Gut Instincts
Food tastes good for the same reason sex feels good. We wouldn’t last very long as a species without both. Without pleasure centers and reward pathways in our brains incentivizing our efforts, we might not have sufficient drive to seek out either. Hunting and gathering take a lot of work. No surprise, then, that our appetites and food cravings are governed in part by the “feel good” messengers in our brains: dopamine (the “reward hormone”), serotonin (the “happiness hormone”), oxytocin (the “love hormone”),1599 endorphins (our own body’s natural opioids), and endocannabinoids (our bodies’ natural cannabis compounds—think of the “munchies” effect).1600

Dopamine release is such an important motivator of food intake that animals genetically engineered to be unable to make dopamine simply starve themselves to death.1601 Food just doesn’t seem to do much for them. Too much dopamine release, however, may lead to overeating.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Hijacking Our Natural Drives

Not all foods are equally rewarding. If you perform PET scans of people’s brains after they eat different meals, you can show that dopamine release is greatest in response to foods people like the most,1602 which tend to be foods high in salt, sugar, and fat. We evolved for millions of years in an environment where sodium was scarce, so a taste for saltiness used to give us a survival advantage. Calories were sometimes scarce, too, but we didn’t need nutrition labels to tell us which foods had more energy. Our taste for sweetness led us to ripe fruit, and our taste for fat drew us to nuts and seeds. Simple survival skills we developed over millions of years. The food industry, however, has hijacked these natural drives and turned them against us.

Ever find yourself eating even when you’re no longer hungry and then continuing to eat even when you know you should stop? Taste engineers manipulate the salt, sugar, and fat contents of foods to achieve what’s referred to in the industry as the bliss point, the peak of craveability.1603 These days, food is designed so we “can’t eat just one.” Hyperpalatable foods can overstimulate our reward pathways, not only overriding our normal satiety signals but potentially our better judgment as well.1604

Brain areas activated just by the smell of foods like potato chips, ice cream, roast beef, and cake are similar to those activated by addictive substances like alcohol.1605 Drugs, whether illicit or legal, may in effect be co-opting brain circuitry originally designed for seeking healthy foods. The reason we may be so vulnerable to such compulsions is that our brains are just not designed to cope with omnipresent access to drugs, video games, pornography, and snack foods.1606

There’s been an exponential increase in scientific publications on food addiction in recent years,1607 spurred by a study entitled “Intense Sweetness Surpasses Cocaine Reward.”1608 Researchers found that when rats were allowed to choose between sugar-sweetened water or intravenous cocaine, nine out of ten chose the sweet taste over one of our most addictive drugs.

People have been chewing coca leaves for at least eight thousand years 1609 as a mild stimulant without any evidence of addiction, but when certain components in the plant were isolated and concentrated into cocaine, it became a different story.1610 Just like with many drugs of abuse, salt, sugar, and fat are substances found in nature, but they exist naturally in much smaller concentrations and may only become problematic when extracted and concentrated by modern industrial processes.1611 Only when the coca leaf is processed into a concentrated form for rapid delivery, such as cocaine and crack, does it become highly addictive. Similarly, the sugarcane stem has been chewed for its pleasant taste for ages,1612 but it only presents a disproportionate reward signal once highly refined into added sugars1613 with the potential to override our self-control mechanisms and, thus, lead to analogous addictive-type behaviors.1614 From the medical journal Current Drug Abuse Reviews:

First, highly processed foods and drugs of abuse are both capable of triggering cravings. Second, consumption of highly processed foods and drugs of abuse can both be associated with compulsive overuse in the face of severe negative consequences. And finally, in some individuals there is evidence of chronic relapse and an inability to cut down consumption of both substances.1615

Certainly, there are lots of people who eat sweet, salty, and greasy foods yet don’t exhibit addictive eating behaviors, but the same is true of addictive drugs. Only about one in seven people who try cocaine goes on to develop a cocaine addiction.1616 Some have contended that food addiction cannot exist because we have to eat, but that’s like arguing alcoholism can’t exist because we have to drink.1617 Yes, we have to drink, but we don’t have to drink alcohol. Yes, we have to breathe, but we don’t have to breathe tobacco. And yes, we have to eat, but we don’t have to eat junk.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
The Frosting Effect

The brain-imaging evidence supporting the concept of food addiction is bolstered by data from pharmaceutical trials that manipulate reward pathways. When researchers gave people the opiate-blocking drug naltrexone (similar to the drug Narcan used to reverse opioid overdoses),1618 the research subjects rated sweets as not tasting as good1619 and were found to consume fewer cookies.1620 Narcan itself reduces the consumption of chocolate cookies, but not an unprocessed, whole-food source of sugar (orange fruit segments).1621 Given over a period of days, opiate blockers can decrease the calories consumed at all-you-can-eat meals by obese individuals by 30 percent.1622

These Narcan-type studies suggest sugar consumption causes the release of endorphins.1623 This would explain the more than one hundred randomized controlled studies on the pain-relieving effects of a little sugar water for infants undergoing painful procedures such as vaccinations1624 (though it was not found effective enough for the pain of circumcision).1625

Fat appears to have a similar effect on the brain as sugar. Feed people yogurt packed with butterfat, and within thirty minutes, they exhibit similar brain activity changes 1626 to those who had just drunk straight sugar water.1627 In the largest study of food addiction to date, involving more than one hundred thousand women from the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study, greasy foods—hamburgers, french fries, and pizza—were the types of fare most linked to food addictions.1628

So which is worse: fat or sugar? The answer is both. As it turns out, opiate-blocking drugs work best not for sugary foods like jelly beans but for foods that combine sugar and fat.1629 The combination of sugar with fat creates a “hedonic synergy.”1630 Think ice cream, candy bars, and donuts. Few folks may sit down to enjoy a bowl of straight sugar or a tub of shortening, but put them together and you have frosting! The sugar can act as a vehicle for fat intake and vice versa. Obese compared to lean individuals have similar pleasure responses to sugar solutions like Kool-Aid, but appear to have a heightened response to sweet foods that are also rich in fat.1631 The “sweet tooth” link to obesity may be more of a “sweet-fat tooth.”1632 If you follow people’s chosen diets, the best predictor of overeating and weight gain in children, adolescents,1633 and adults may be the selection of high-fat, high-sugar foods.1634

In nature, while there are foods that contain sugar (like fruit) and foods that contain fat (like nuts), sugar and fat rarely occur in the same food naturally.1635 There is one, and it’s the most natural food of all. Can you think of it? Breast milk. Maybe that’s why high-fat, high-sugar foods are so addictive. We wouldn’t last long as a species if babies didn’t crave breast milk. Some have speculated that much of the success of both low-fat and low-carb diets may be from the elimination of these high-fat, high-sugar mixtures that we’re programmed to crave.


It’s All in the Process

Why don’t we crave trail mix as much? That’s about as sugary and fatty as natural foods get. The key appears to lie in the processing, which increases the dose and speed of absorption of the sugar and fat. Hard liquor is more addictive than beer because of the dose, and crack is more addictive than cocaine because of the speed of absorption. Food processing can increase both simultaneously, delivering high loads of concentrated sugar and fat, while, at the same time, stripping away fiber, protein, and water to maximize the rate of absorption.1638

In the landmark study published in 2015 entitled “Which Foods May Be Addictive?” that I mentioned in the Low Glycemic Load section, dozens of foods were ranked based on reports of problematic, addictive-type behaviors from hundreds of individuals. The two most troublesome were high-fat, high-sugar combos: chocolate and ice cream. Most at the top of the list were high in fat, but every single one of the top fifteen was a processed food. In contrast, all the foods least likely to be associated with addictive behaviors were unprocessed. The bottom ten least-addictive foods were strawberries, apples, corn, salmon, bananas, carrots, brown rice, cucumbers, broccoli, and beans.1639

This was finally put to the test for weight control in 2019. Study subjects were presented with the same amounts of calories, salt, sugar, fat, carbs, protein, and fiber in processed versus unprocessed forms, such as a breakfast of cereal and a muffin versus oatmeal with fruit and nuts. Over a two-week period, those randomized to eat the processed foods gained two pounds, whereas those randomized to unprocessed foods lost two pounds. The researchers concluded that “limiting consumption of ultra-processed foods may be an effective strategy for obesity prevention and treatment.”1640

Processed food manufacturers may also insert flavor-enhancing additives like sodium to further manipulate the reward value,1641 reminiscent of tobacco industry additives to enhance nicotine delivery and flavor1642—including added fat, sugar, and salt.1643 One of the dietary changes noted during opioid detox is an increase in salted foods, perhaps to tap into the same reward pathways.1644 In one sense, we have no control over most of the sodium we’re exposed to since more than two-thirds of sodium intake comes not from the saltshaker at home but from salt added to packaged foods and dishes in restaurants.1645 In another sense, however, most of us actually have total control, as we can choose to buy fewer processed foods and eat out less.


Eaten Away
The eating habits of Americans have been described as “eat[ing] breakfast in their cars, lunch at their desks and chicken from a bucket.”1646 Most of us eat out at least three times a week1647 and average an extra two hundred or so calories on the days we do, all while taking in less nutrition.1648 The blood levels of nearly all examined micronutrients were lower among those who ate more meals out, largely reflecting a drop in the consumption of plant foods.1649 This may be a particular problem at fast-food restaurants. A modern-day case of scurvy was even diagnosed in someone on a “strict fast food diet.”1650

Little has changed in recent years to improve the quality of fast-food restaurant menus. (The one exception is the removal of partially hydrogenated oils, thanks to the trans fat ban, but not all trans fat has gone away—cheeseburgers are now worse offenders than fries, due to the inherent trans fat in meat and dairy.1651) Those who eat out more often in general tend to be at greater risk of becoming overweight or obese, and this appears to particularly be the case for fast food.1652 People who eat more fast food also tend to eat more unhealthfully in general, though—more meat, white bread, and sweets—so rather than fast food leading to bad eating habits, bad eating habits may lead people to fast food.1653

An estimated three-quarters of adolescents eat fast food on a weekly basis, a dramatic rise over the last fifty years.1654 What role might this play in the obesity epidemic? Teens were seated in a food court and allowed to eat as much as they wanted of a typical fast-food meal. If you assume three meals a day and a couple of snacks, you would want to stay under about 30 percent of your daily energy requirements in any one meal, which, in the case of these teens, came out to be just under 800 or so calories. Fast food, however, is so high in calorie density, so high in fat and sugar, and so low in fiber that they ended up eating an average of 1,652 calories at that one meal.1655

Is it just the supersized portions and rapid eating rate intrinsic to the fast-food business model? The same researchers set up another experiment in which they portioned out a fast-food meal of chicken nuggets, french fries, and cola into smaller servings presented at fifteen-minute intervals to prevent gorging. It didn’t work. In the end, the teens ended up eating the same amount, basically filling their stomachs to physical capacity.1656

The industry spends nearly $2 billion marketing these kinds of foods to children and adolescents.1657 Maybe the nutrition profession would be more vocal in their disapproval if they stopped allowing their conferences to be sponsored by the likes of McDonald’s and Coca-Cola.1658 Just a thought.

****************************************************************************************************
Buzzkill
Fast-food meals frequently contribute a fourth addictive factor to the salt, sugar, and fat trifecta by adding caffeinated drinks. In response to a proposal to ban the use of caffeine as a food additive, soda manufacturers claimed it was not used to make their products more addictive but rather as a “flavoring agent.”1659 When put to the test, though, even highly trained subjects could not detect a difference in taste between soda with and without caffeine.1660 Given that, the more plausible explanation is that caffeine is added to produce physical dependence, which in turn encourages repeat purchases by consumers, many of whom are children.1661

Caffeine has a well-known reinforcing effect. It creates a Pavlovian connection between whatever behaviors the body associates with it, from experimentally conditioning one’s choice of color-coded capsules1662 to changing flavor preferences.1663 No wonder the food industry started adding caffeine not just to soda but to everything from ice cream and candy bars to beef jerky and potato chips.1664 Even bottled water and instant oatmeal have been spiked.1665

The phenomenon of caffeine reinforcing whatever behaviors we’re up to when we’re exposed to it brings up an interesting point: Caffeine is a problem when it’s used by the soda industry to hook our kids on liquid candy, but anything that gets people to eat more oatmeal could flip the whole risk-versus-benefit equation. It makes me think we should start drinking our green tea with broccoli. Maybe that will get us to start craving greens!


****************************************************************************************************
Change Your Palate’s Palette

The obesity epidemic has been blamed on the abundance of “palatable hyper-caloric” foods1666—in other words, high-calorie foods that taste good. After all, as one medical journal editorial put it, “Yummy food is made from fat and sugar.”1667 So is the answer to just not eat anything tasty? No. As I detail in the conclusion of How Not to Die, you can actually change your taste buds and end up with the best of both worlds: tastes great and more filling.

One pharmacology journal review concluded that we “need to find ways to restrain compulsive intake of palatable food.”1668 It suggests opiate-blocking drugs, but you can imagine jaw-wiring or stomach-stapling would have the same desired effect. The underlying assumption is that palatable food equals unhealthy food, which is only true because the food industry has so deadened our palates with hypersalty, hypersweet, hyperfatty foods. The ripest peach in the world may taste sour after a bowl of Froot Loops. The good news is that studies show the more we eat healthy foods, the more we come to like them.1669

The original taste-changing studies were done on salt reduction. Switch people to a low-salt diet, and everything may taste like cardboard at first.1670 You can imagine the study subjects thinking they could never live like that. But then it happened. Over the ensuing weeks, they liked the taste of salt-free soup more and more, and the taste of salty soup less and less. Our tastes physically change. Let them salt their own soup to taste, and they added less and less the longer they were on the low-salt diet and began to prefer it that way. By the end, soup tasted just as salty with half the salt. The longer we eat healthier foods, the better they taste.

Surprisingly, we can change our sixth sense too. You’ve probably heard of the five basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and savory. It turns out there are indications our taste buds can register the taste of fat as well.1671 This may help explain why people on low-fat diets start liking low-fat foods more and high-fat foods less.1672 The less fat we eat, the more sensitive to fat our tongues appear to become, which may translate into people spontaneously reducing their intakes of butter, meat, dairy, and eggs.1673 Salt may override this effect,1674 though, so it may be important to cut down on both simultaneously.

It’s all about resetting our taste thermostats. The average life span of a taste bud cell may only be about 250 hours.1675 That means each of our taste buds could get replaced every ten days or so. This makes sense since they are constantly being assaulted by everything from burning-hot liquids to normal everyday abrasion by our teeth, food, and the roofs of our mouths. Though much of the change in taste perceptions is presumably higher up in our brains, it may be helpful to reflect that our taste buds are basically reborn anew every few weeks, giving us another chance for a fresh start.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

There have been times when someone happens to see me eating something simple like a sweet potato, and they look at me as if I’m some type of ascetic monk. “Good for you,” they might say, “but I could never eat that way.” They think I’m living a life of deprivation. Far from it. They don’t understand that a sweet potato really tastes good to me (and with a little sprinkle of cinnamon, it tastes even better!). Natural foods as grown can be delicious, but only after you’ve escaped the numbing shackles of industry manipulations to deaden your senses. I realize the thought of eventually savoring something like corn on the cob without butter or salt may sound ridiculous to some. You won’t believe it until you try it out for yourself: Cut out processed foods for a few weeks, and you’ll be amazed how good healthy can taste.


****************************************************************************************************
Was America Supersized?
Just because we’re eating more calories doesn’t necessarily mean we’re eating more food. The calories in what we’re eating these days may just be more concentrated. Theoretically, the estimated 20 percent more calories we’re getting now could simply mean we’re getting an average of 20 percent more calories per bite.

Portion sizes have gone up, though. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the average cheeseburger went from 5.8 to 7.3 ounces, the average portion size of salty snacks grew from 1.0 to 1.6 ounces, and the average soft drink increased from about 13 to nearly 20 fluid ounces.1684 What’s more, larger portions do seem to translate into larger intake, even if we don’t take that last bite or final sip—so size does matter. Give moviegoers popcorn in a bucket, and they eat about 50 percent more than when they’re served the same popcorn in a smaller (but still excessively sized) box.1685 In a candy experiment, people given one-pound bags of M&M’s reportedly ate 120 candies while watching a video compared to those given a half-pound bag who only ate 63.1686

On a population scale, the increased portion sizes, along with increased eating frequency throughout the day, do appear to account for most of the national increase in caloric intake.1687 On an individual basis, however, calorie concentration can trump portion size.1688 Decrease by 33 percent the size of an extra-large serving of pasta, and people eat about 10 percent less, but decrease by 33 percent the calorie concentration of the sauce for a broccoli, cauliflower, and tomato purée by replacing some of the cream and cheese, and the decrease in calorie consumption is nearly three times greater.1689

Obese individuals don’t necessarily eat a greater weight of food, but the foods they choose do tend to have more calories per mouthful.1690 So excess intake may have more to do with food quality than quantity. Overeating may be less about consuming an abnormal amount of food and more about consuming an abnormal type of food: meals that are unnaturally dense in calories.

****************************************************************************************************
How Many Calories Can You Stomach?
Our stomachs are only so big. Once we fill them up, stretch receptors in our stomach walls tell us when we’ve had enough. Given this limit, if you wanted to gain weight, how could you do it? Well, you could eat more frequently. Alternatively, you could increase the number of calories in each stomach-load by changing what you eat—that is, by changing calorie density, the number of calories for a given weight or volume of food.

Some foods have more calories per cup, per pound, per mouthful than others. Oil, for example, has a high calorie density, which means it has a high calorie concentration with lots of calories packed in a small space. Drizzling just one tablespoon of oil on a dish adds 120 calories.1691 For those same 120 calories, you could eat about two cups of blackberries, a food with a low calorie density.1692 You could swig down that spoonful of oil and not even feel a difference in your stomach, but eating a couple of cups of berries could start to fill you up.

A handful of jelly beans has about sixteen times more calories than a handful of cherry tomatoes.1693,1694 So for the same number of calories, you could eat that one handful of jelly beans or about four cups of cherry tomatoes. A large serving of french fries is about the same size and weight as a baked potato but has about four times more calories.1695,1696 So for the same number of calories, you could have that single serving of fries or around four baked potatoes. Which do you think would be more filling?

The average human stomach can expand to fit about a quart of food,1697 which is around four cups. A single stomachful of strawberry ice cream, about two pints, could max out our caloric intake for an entire day.1698 What if you wanted to get those same two thousand or so calories from strawberries themselves? You’d have to eat forty-four cups of berries.1699 That’s eleven stomachfuls. As delicious as strawberries are, I don’t think I could fill my stomach to bursting eleven times in a day. Some foods are just impossible to overeat. They are so low in calorie density that you just couldn’t physically eat a big enough quantity to maintain your weight.

On the next page is an infographic of how many stomachfuls of food you would need to eat in a day to get two thousand calories.

Zucchini is even less calorie dense than broccoli. You could eat 100 cups of sliced zucchini a day and still lose weight.1700 The calories in cucumbers are so dilute you’d have to eat more than 150 cups a day to gain weight1701 and more than 250 cups of chopped kale.1702 You just couldn’t do it. That’s the magic of nonstarchy vegetables and fruit. You could be filled to the brim with fresh fruit three times a day and still lose weight because they’re mostly water and air. An apple, for example, is 85 percent water by weight and 20 percent air by volume (which is why you can bob for them on Halloween).1703

At the other extreme, there are pure fats like butter and oil that are so calorically dense you could exceed your total calorie input for the day filling up your stomach only a quarter of the way just once. So, hundreds of cups of vegetables or a single stick of butter? Hopefully no one is eating butter by the stick—this is just to illustrate how leaning toward the lower-calorie-density foods on average could enable you to eat the same amount of food, or even more, and still lose weight.


On average, those who eat low-energy-density diets consume hundreds of fewer calories, yet they eat significantly more food, about three-quarters of a pound more a day.1704 Most weight-loss diets focus on decreasing portion size, but we know “eat less” approaches can leave people feeling hungry and unsatisfied.1705 Shifting the emphasis from restriction to positive “eat more” messaging of increasing intake of healthy, low-energy-density foods may offer a more promising strategy.

****************************************************************************************************
Apes vs. Twinkies
It’s ironic that the method used to achieve rapid weight gain in malnourished children—frequent, high-calorie-density meals—has become the de facto norm for many children (and adults) today.1707 In the study about fast food that I explored in the Low in Addictive Foods section, the teens, when presented with an unlimited fast-food lunch, piled in an average of 1,652 calories in just one meal.1708 The propensity to overeat isn’t limited to fast food, of course, but even if you stuffed yourself to the brim with foods low on the calorie density scale—like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans—you wouldn’t reach anywhere near that caloric load.

Fast food averages about 1,200 calories per pound,1709 whereas traditional African diets, which more closely represent the likely diet of our ancient ancestors, average fewer than 500 calories per pound.1710 So the biological mechanisms our bodies use to regulate our weight likely evolved in the context of eating at least four or five pounds of food a day. That may be the more natural amount of food to eat. If your body is counting on eating five pounds of food but you max out with the same number of calories eating just two pounds of modern convenience food, what do you think happens? It’s no wonder we overeat—our bodies are expecting three more pounds of food! Our bodies just weren’t designed to handle such calorie-concentrated diets.

It makes evolutionary sense that we crave calorically dense foods. Put kids in a brain scanner, and you can see greater reward center activation when they view pictures of foods with higher calorie density.1711 We’ve been hardwired by eons of periodic scarcity to seek out the greatest caloric bang for our foraging buck.1712 In a primitive setting, that motivation would drive us toward picking the ripest fruits and digging up the starchiest roots, but now, that same biological drive compels us toward processed junk heaviest in added sugars and fats.

Traditional grain-based diets represent what we’ve been eating for thousands of years before the Industrial Age, but if you go back millions of years to the dawn of humanity, we likely ate more like contemporary great apes, with whom our DNA still differs at most by only a few percent. This means a diet centered around leafy vegetables, shoots, roots, berries and other fruits, seeds, and nuts.1713 Researchers at the University of Toronto decided to try putting people on just such an ape diet. Even after including higher-calorie-density foods like nuts, research subjects had to eat twelve pounds of food a day to maintain their weights.1714 So it seems very likely our appetite control mechanisms evolved eating massive quantities of food. Our bodies never expected to meet a Twinkie.

How much food does it take to reach 2,000 calories at different caloric densities? As you can see in the graph below, you would need to eat eight pounds of food a day on a low-calorie-density diet of 250 calories per pound, whereas on a high-calorie-density diet, you’d have to restrict yourself to eating four times less food.

What happens when you go back for seconds? On a low-calorie-density diet, an extra helping might only add a few dozen calories, whereas, at the higher end, the same helping could add hundreds. A second serving of concentrated-calorie foods a few times a week could translate into tens of thousands of excess calories a year.


Seventeen Pounds in Twenty-One Days
Given that on a day-to-day basis, we tend to eat a similar amount of food,1715 it would make sense that if there were fewer calories in the same mass of food, you’d take in fewer calories and lose more weight. Studies in which foods are covertly passed into people’s stomachs through a tube have confirmed that the stomach registers volume much more than it does calories in terms of appetite and subsequent food intake.1716 Researchers were able to cut people’s caloric intake nearly in half, from 3,000 daily calories down to 1,570, without cutting portions—just by substituting less-calorie-dense foods.1717 They replaced meats and sugary foods with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Despite the sudden slashing of their caloric intakes almost in half, the research subjects reported equal satiety and enjoyment.

So do people who eat higher-calorie-density diets gain more weight? Apparently so. There is “strong and consistent evidence” that those consuming a diet higher in calorie density do tend to gain weight, while those eating diets lower in calorie density improve both weight loss and weight maintenance.1718 We can’t be sure this is due to calorie density itself, though, since calorie-dilute foods tend to be healthier1719 in a variety of ways—for example, less processed, more fiber.

Low-calorie-density diets offer the best of both worlds: higher dietary quality and better weight loss.

Portion-controlled diets, often incorporating liquid meal replacements, can be effective in the short term1720 but may increase the risk of binge-eating episodes1721 and may actually be counterproductive in the long run. Individuals randomized to a few months of lifestyle education and SlimFast meal replacements actually did significantly worse years later than the group who had just gotten the education.1722 The thinking is that the motivation to learn and implement healthy eating strategies was undermined by the reliance on meal replacements as a convenient crutch. What if instead of having people eat less food overall, you have them eat more calorically dilute foods?

Before spam was unwanted email cluttering our in-boxes, it was SPAM, a processed canned meat product popular in Hawaii. Researchers in Hawaii tried putting people on a traditional, pre-SPAM, Hawaiian diet with all the plant foods they could eat.1723 The study subjects lost an average of seventeen pounds in just twenty-one days. Caloric intake dropped by 40 percent, but not because they were eating less food. The subjects lost seventeen pounds in three weeks eating more food, in excess of four pounds of food a day.


Chewing the Fat
If you lower the calorie density of your diet, you could keep eating the same amount of food yet lose weight. If you lower it enough, you could eat even more food than usual and still shed pounds. So how can you decrease the density? A quick look at the two extremes of the Calories in Three Pounds of Food graph should make apparent two methods: abandon added fats and add abandoned vegetables.

As we saw in the Low in Added Fat section, covertly put people on a relatively low-fat diet (20 percent calories from fat), and they tend to lose body fat every day even though they can eat as much as they want. If you then give those same people the same meals, but this time sneakily add in enough extra fats and oils to change it to a high-fat diet (60 percent of calories from fat), they gain body fat every day.1725 Because people randomized to consume higher-fat diets tend to consume more calories, the term high-fat hyperphagia was coined, implying that fat somehow made people eat more, but that wasn’t the case. Instead, those secretly switched from low-fat to high-fat diets simply continued to eat nearly the same amount of food no matter the fat content. All that extra fat just spiked the calorie density, so all of a sudden, eating the same amount of food meant inadvertently eating a lot more calories.

The study subjects were men with big appetites who were already eating about four pounds of food a day. The high-fat diet was so calorie dense that they would have had to have eaten around six pounds a day of the lower-fat meals to cause the same kind of weight gain. Since the subjects didn’t even notice the difference between the two diet phases, those who were started on the high-fat diet ate the same four pounds of the lower-fat meals after being switched, so they went from gaining weight to losing weight without even realizing it.1732 That’s why manipulating added fat content can be so powerful.

But if you feed people higher- or lower-fat diets with the same calorie density (by diluting the high-fat meals with water, for example), the high-fat hyperphagia effect disappears. So it isn’t the fat per se. With more than twice the calories as carbs or protein, fat is just so calorie dense that it can slip in more calories per bite. So the phenomenon was renamed passive overconsumption, which you may remember from the Causes section. Fat doesn’t drive us to overeat. Unintentionally, we just may eat more calories without even knowing it.1733

A paper in the journal Public Health Nutrition entitled “Two Important Exceptions to the Relationship Between Energy Density and Fat Content” added important caveats.1734 Processed foods with reduced fat claims on the front of their packaging are often so packed with sugar that they may have the same number of calories per serving as a higher fat product. SnackWell’s fat-free cookies, for example, at 1,700 calories per pound1735 are as calorie dense as a cheese danish.1736

The other exception noted was that vegetables are so calorie dilute that even high-fat veggie dishes like buttered broccoli tend to be less calorically dense overall than most of what people are eating.1737

This brings up the second strategy for lowering dietary calorie density: instead of sneaking out fat, sneak in vegetables.

Souped-Up Weight Loss

If the water content of vegetables is their secret to low-calorie density, what about taking that to its logical conclusion and feeding people liquids, as in soup? Soup consumers tend to have slimmer waists and lower body weight, perhaps as a consequence of the lower average calorie density of their diets, but they also tend to exhibit other healthy eating behaviors, such as eating more greens and beans.1738 You don’t know if it’s the soup itself unless you put it to the test.

In a study funded by Campbell’s—who else?—people on calorie-restricted diets were randomized to eat either two servings of soup a day or two dry snacks like crackers or pretzels with the same number of calories as the soup servings. After one year, the soup group lost 50 percent more weight, about fifteen pounds compared to around ten pounds.1739 Of course, their sodium intakes went up—even “low sodium” Campbell’s soup may exceed by more than 250 percent my one-to-one sodium-per-calorie ratio recommendation I detailed in How Not to Die.1740 So I encourage everyone to look for no-salt-added soup varieties or make your own.

****************************************************************************************************
Dangling a Carrot
The biggest influence on calorie density is not fat but water content.1741 Since water adds weight and bulk without adding calories, the most calorie-dense foods and the most calorie-dense diets tend to be those that are dry.1742 Some vegetables, on the other hand, are more than 95 percent water, and, as we saw in the High in Water-Rich Foods section, it’s not just iceberg lettuce. Bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, cucumbers, celery, turnips, cooked napa cabbage, bok choy, summer squash, and zucchini may top out at 95 percent water.1743 They’re basically water in vegetable form. A big bowl of water-rich vegetables is practically just a big bowl of trapped water.

The effect on calorie density is so dramatic, the food industry wants in on the action. In a research paper entitled “Food Nanotechnology: Water Is the Key to Lowering the Energy Density of Processed Foods,” one researcher proposed “structuring a solid processed food similar to a celery stalk using self-assembled, water-filled, edible nanocells or nanotubes.”1744 No need, as Mother Nature has already done it for us.

If piling on vegetables causes protests at the dinner table, hidden vegetables can be used to covertly decrease calorie density, just as hidden fat can be used to covertly increase it. In a famous Penn State study, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini were added secretly to familiar entrées, while the dishes’ appearance, flavor, and texture were maintained (by puréeing vegetables into pasta sauce, for example).1745 The kids in the study were none the wiser and ate the same amount of food, thereby taking in significantly fewer calories and significantly more vegetables. Win-win!

Surreptitiously slipping veggies to unsuspecting kids shouldn’t be the only way to get them to eat them, though. The researchers stress the importance of using several approaches, including repeated exposure to originally disliked whole vegetables, which has been shown to improve acceptance over time.1746 Taste familiarity is an important determinant of children’s food preferences. The more they are exposed to the taste, the more likely it is they’ll eat them.1747 So the best way to get kids to eat their vegetables is to have them actually eat their vegetables so they can develop a lifelong appreciation.1748 Covertly incorporating vegetables can be one strategy, but they’re not going be living at home forever, and we want to leave them with a legacy of overtly healthy habits too.

The same vegetable sneak-attack strategy has been used successfully in adults.1749 In fact, study subjects actually preferred some of the “vegetable-enhanced” meals to their non-veggie-fortified options. What’s more, even though they ate bigger portions of the meals with added vegetables, they still took in fewer calories.

Again, that’s the beauty of calorie density. The subjects were awarded the twin benefit of eating a pound of vegetables a day and consuming 350 fewer calories. More food, fewer calories. Keep that up and over time, you could lose thirty-five pounds just like that.1750

What may be an even more effective weight-loss strategy than just adding calorie-dilute veggies is a combination approach. Those randomized to receive advice about reducing fat intake lost more weight than those just told to eat more fruits and vegetables, but those instructed to do both— lower their fat consumption while increasing their fruit and veggie intakes—did the best, losing seventeen pounds and maintaining that reduction for the whole year.1751 Yes, simply adding vegetables—whether covertly or overtly, like adding chopped greens to rice—can decrease calorie density, caloric intake, and hunger,1752 but simultaneously adding vegetables while removing fat can attack the problem from both sides. For example, adding puréed broccoli and cauliflower in place of some of the cheese in a pasta sauce successfully decreased calorie density by 25 percent, leading to a full 25 percent reduction in caloric intake in children, 79 percent of whom rated the less cheesy, vegetable-heavier version as tasting the same or better.1753


Mushrooming Weight Loss

Mushrooms are a great way to swap out calories and swap in flavor. They only have about one hundred calories per pound,1754 so incorporating them into our meals can certainly lower calorie density, but it’s their savory umami flavor that develops particularly well during cooking that makes them an ideal meat replacer. Studies show substituting mushrooms for meat can cut meal calories in half without compromising palatability or satiety. This led researchers to suggest that even just making one such swap a week could result in more than five pounds of weight loss in a year.1755

In another study, Johns Hopkins researchers randomized overweight individuals into one of two groups: those instructed to follow the USDA Food Guide Pyramid–based diet prescription, or another told to adhere to the same diet prescription but to also incorporate mushrooms instead of meat into meals three times a week. A year later, not only did the mushroom group have better metabolic markers and less inflammation (which you would expect from any sort of meat reduction), but they also achieved a significant loss in weight of seven pounds at six months and kept it off for the rest of the year.1756 Pass the portobello burgers!


Out of Thin Air
Pop Quiz: Aside from fiber and water, what other food component has zero calories? Hint: Maybe I should have called this a Popcorn Quiz. Air. Air has zero calories. A cup of corn kernels has four times more calories than a cup of popped corn kernels,1757,1758 despite having more water. That may be one reason popcorn is more filling than potato chips. Six cups of popcorn was found to be more satiating than about the same weight of potato chips (one cup), though in this case the difference in fat content also affected the calorie density.1759 To control for both water and fat content, researchers decided to study cheese puffs.

Researchers compared Crunchy Cheetos to Cheetos Puffs. Though both have the same number of calories per pound, the Puffs have fewer calories per volume because they’ve been puffed up with air. Study subjects were offered a big bowl of each, and, although they consumed nearly 75 percent greater volume of the Puffs, they still ended up taking in about 20 percent fewer calories, presumably because the Puffs had so many fewer calories per cup due to the added air.1760 Of course, neither cheesy snack food is a good choice, as they both exceed 2,500 calories per pound, worse even than straight-up cheese.1761,1762

The Cheetos study wasn’t perfect. The two types of Cheetos differed in their ingredients, which could have affected the results. To see if food volume independently affects intake, an ingeniously simple experiment was devised: Researchers crushed up some Wheaties. Reducing the flake size reduced the volume, so they could feed people the identical food, differing not by calories per pound but by calories per cup. The study subjects poured themselves less of the crushed Wheaties, sensing it was denser, but not enough to avoid pouring themselves 34 percent more calories.1763 So it seems volume really does appear to make a difference.

Since we tend to consistently eat both a certain weight and volume of food,1764 eating foods higher in both water and air (and therefore lower in calorie density) may facilitate weight loss—which brings us to fruit.


Bearing Fruit

One of the reasons bananas are so light is that 20 percent of their volume is straight-up air.1765 Because most of the rest of a banana is water, 85 percent of a banana is calorie-free. Fruits even higher in water content—like apples and pears—are more than 90 percent calorie-free. So what would happen if you had people add fresh fruit to their regular diets?

In a study out of Brazil, people were randomized to eat three apples or three pears a day as snacks between meals on top of whatever else they were eating. Fruit is low in calories, but not calorie-free, so if they’re adding foods to their diets, won’t they gain weight? No, they actually lost a couple of pounds. Could that weight loss simply be due to all the additional fiber they were getting from the apples and pears? Enter the cookie group. The study subjects were randomized to three apples, three pears, or three oatmeal cookies with enough oats in them to have about the same amount of fiber as the fruit. So all three groups added about the same number of calories and same amount of fiber. Unlike the fruit, however, adding oatmeal cookies to the diet did not lead to weight loss, despite the added fiber. No shocker there. Because of its water content, the fruit was five times heavier, so it offered five times as much food as the cookies. Cookies are so calorie dense that you can add hundreds of calories without feeling much of a difference, whereas people appeared to unconsciously compensate for all the extra bulk from the fruit by eating less of everything else and lost weight as a result.1766

When three methods of lowering calorie density were compared—covertly manipulating fat levels by removing butter and oil, adding diced or puréed fruits and vegetables, or adding water—decreasing fat seemed to work best in terms of decreasing overall daily calorie consumption. However, this may have been complicated by the fact that the entrées with the added fruits, vegetables, and water were rated moister and were associated with faster eating rates compared to the reduced-fat entrées. The bottom line is that a combination of approaches might work best, like replacing oil with applesauce when baking, achieving both a fat reduction and a fruit enhancement.1767

If researchers with no culinary training can covertly reduce calorie counts without anyone noticing, why can’t chefs? Nearly all chefs surveyed, 93 percent, thought the calories in menu items could indeed be reduced by up to 25 percent without customers noticing. So why don’t they? The greatest barrier they identified was “low consumer demand.”


****************************************************************************************************
Are Nuts the Exception?

Nuts have a high calorie density. At the same time, nuts are one of the few foods that, on their own, may literally add years to your life.1769 Not only may they slow the aging process itself,1770 but an ounce a day, which is just about a handful or a quarter cup, may also reduce the risk of dying from heart disease, stroke, cancer, respiratory disease, diabetes, and infections1771—more than half of our top ten killers. So it comes as no surprise that nut consumption is associated with lower risk of dying prematurely across the board. As the title of a recent editorial in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology put it: “Eat Nuts, Live Longer.”1772

On a global scale, inadequate nut consumption (under twenty grams a day) may be responsible for millions of deaths,1773 but what does that mean on a personal level? Studies have found, for example, that those eating nuts just twice a week or more appear to cut their mortality risk in half compared to those who almost never eat nuts.1774 You could flip that around and suggest that not eating nuts doubles your chances of dying prematurely. Is that really true, though? Yes and no.

There are many potentially confounding factors, such as those who consume nuts tend to smoke less, exercise more, and eat less meat and more fruits and vegetables, but the mortality benefits appear to persist even after controlling for these factors.1775 Even if we knew for certain it was cause and effect, it’s important to understand what halving our mortality risk really means.

As a healthy, middle-aged person, our risk of dying over the next ten years may only be about 2 percent, a one-in-fifty chance of dying over the next decade, but that’s if we don’t eat nuts.1776 If we do eat them, our risk of dying may drop to 1 percent. So, yes, technically, we just cut our risk in half by going from 2 percent to 1 percent, but, at the same time, we really only cut our absolute risk of dying by a single percentage point. That may not sound as impressive, but to me, dying at such a relatively young age seems such a tragedy that it would be worth making lifestyle changes to drive down that risk as low as possible, especially when one such strategy is a simple, delicious dietary tweak.

Given the purported mortality benefits of eating nuts and despite their high calorie density, it would seem worthwhile to include them in our regular diets by consciously substituting them in place of the same number of calories from other foods. Thankfully, our bodies appear to do it for us automatically.1777 Nuts appear to be so satiating that if you give people a midmorning snack of almonds, not only do they subsequently eat less at lunch, they eat less at dinner, too, spontaneously accounting for the extra almond calories.

This explains how you can make thirty thousand calories “vanish” into thin air. Those randomized to add servings of almonds,1778 pistachios,1779 hazelnuts,1780 or walnuts1781 to their daily diets for months didn’t gain a single pound on average. In the Nuts and Seeds chapter in How Not to Die, I cataloged the factors beyond appetite suppression thought responsible for this vanishing act. A new one to add to the list arose from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled brain scan study out of Harvard. The researcher’s “fruit smoothie delivery system” involved identically tasting, fat- and calorie-matched smoothies made either with walnuts or with oil and walnut flavoring.1782 The brain scans showed that those unknowingly consuming the real walnuts exhibited increased activation of a part of their brains thought to involve the ability to control cravings. There’s just something in nuts that appears to be especially satisfying.

A significant proportion of the calories in nuts also quite literally gets flushed away. The actual number of calories that our systems absorb from nuts may be as much as 20 percent lower than it says on the nutrition label because the calories are encapsulated inside cell walls.1783 No matter how well we chew, some of the calories remain trapped inside unbroken cells, each of which is surrounded by an indigestible wall of fiber.1784 The calories in whole plant foods are effectively walled off, which may help explain why other higher-calorie-density foods like meat and processed foods are associated with weight gain, whereas nuts are not.1785

As a high-calorie-density food, the admonition to “eat sparingly” still applies, but that’s all one may need. While the optimum benefits of fruits and vegetables may require cups a day, nuts appear so potent that the mortality benefits may be had for mere ounces a week.


//
LOW IN MEAT
Should We Stop Meating Like This?
Rather than promoting produce, most of our U.S. taxpayer-dollar subsidies support the production of meat, dairy, oils, and sugar.1789 So while I was excited to discover that there is a National Watermelon Promotion Board, its budget is dwarfed by the combined quarter-billion-dollar might of the federal government–administered American Egg,1790 Cattlemen’s Beef,1791 National Dairy,1792 and National Pork boards.1793 Don’t expect Dollar Menu melons anytime soon.

So given the cheapness of meat, what role might it be playing in the obesity epidemic? The largest study of those eating plant-based diets found that American vegetarians tend to weigh about twenty-five pounds less than those who eat meat.1794 Compared to those chewing meat, those eschewing it also appear to gain less weight as they age.1795 Kids1796 and teens1797 eating more vegetarian meals also tend to be leaner than their nonvegetarian peers. They aren’t smaller in general, though: Vegetarian boys and girls measure up to be about an inch taller than their “omnivorous classmates.”1798 They just aren’t as wide.

It’s certainly not all or nothing, though. Quantity matters. A research team sifted through more than a thousand studies published just since the year 2000 to perform a systematic review on which foods were “determinants of long-term weight change.” Not surprisingly, they found that white bread, sweets, and desserts all seem to promote weight gain. Their main finding, however, was that evidence is strongest for high meat intake predicting more weight gain.1799 Those who eat a lot of meat also tend to eat less fruit, whole grains, and nuts,1800 though, all of which may be protective against gaining weight.1801 So is the weight gain because they’re eating more animal products or because they’re eating fewer plants? Or might it be something else entirely? Those who eat more meat also tend to exercise less, for example,1802 or maybe they’re just drinking soda with their burgers.

In the same vein, vegans are forty pounds lighter on average than those who eat conventional diets,1803 but that doesn’t mean that cutting out meat, dairy, and eggs will necessarily make you lose forty pounds. Those who eat healthier also tend to live healthier, so it’s not necessarily the diet per se. Maybe vegans eat out less and work out more. To see if meat has an independent effect on obesity, we need to control for both dietary and nondietary factors.

When researchers have tried to account for these differences, controlling for other nutritional and lifestyle considerations like fiber intake and exercise, the link between meat consumption and weight gain remained solid.1804 Over a twenty-month period, for example, those eating about three more ounces of meat a day had about three times the risk of gaining five or more pounds.1805 Another study found that those who ate about five ounces of meat a day had eight times the incidence of abdominal obesity over a year compared to those who ate around one ounce of meat daily.1806 (An ounce of meat is about the size of a golf ball.) Meat intake seems to be more closely associated with abdominal weight gain than peripheral gain—that is, bigger bellies rather than bigger thighs.1807 Over a ten-year period, the amount of weight gain associated with eating more than seven servings of meat a week (compared to those averaging less than about one serving of meat every other day) was the same as the amount of weight lost by women who walked or men who jogged or ran four or more hours a week.


Even a Paltry Amount of Poultry?
Could it be as simple as people who eat more meat tend to take in more calories?1809 Most of those studies linking meat consumption with weight gain controlled for total caloric intake. This implies that if you have two people eating about the same number of calories, the person eating more meat might gain more weight. To find out which meat may be the most fattening, an epic study was performed. EPIC is actually the name of the study, and it lives up to its moniker, having enrolled hundreds of thousands of men and women, assessing their dietary intakes, and following them out for years.

The EPIC researchers also found total meat consumption linked to increased weight gain, even at similar caloric intakes. They concluded: “Our results are therefore in favor of the public health recommendation to decrease meat consumption for health improvement.” The surprise, though, was that poultry appeared to be the most fattening. Consumption of poultry—mostly chicken—was associated with three times the weight gain compared to red meat like beef,1810,1811 and this was after taking into account age, gender, physical activity level, smoking status, overall dietary quality, and calorie counts.

How did the meat industry respond to the EPIC findings? By suggesting that perhaps the extra weight gain was muscle mass and not body fat.1812 Could the meat have made the subjects beefier rather than fatter? The researchers responded to the industry’s challenge by going back and specifically assessing changes in the subjects’ waistlines and found the same thing.1813 Even when eating around the same number of calories, the more meat we eat, the more our bellies may grow. The researchers even calculated how much our waistlines might be predicted to expand, based on our daily meat consumption. It only came out to be one extra inch around the waist over the five-year follow-up for a daily chicken breast’s worth,1814 but that appears to be independent of the calories.

No other such study comes close to EPIC in size, but another one followed thousands of individuals for even longer and confirmed the connection between poultry consumption and increased risk of weight gain over a period of fourteen years. Using statistical methods to adjust for other factors, researchers effectively tried to study men and women who ate about the same number of calories a day, consumed the same amount of vegetables, fruits, and grains, and did about the same amount of exercise—but ate different amounts of meat. On average, at baseline, those who ate less than a small serving of meat a day were not overweight, but the more meat they ate, the heavier they were.1815 By one and a half servings a day, they crossed the threshold of a BMI of 25 to become officially classified as overweight.

Over the following fourteen years, chicken consumption was associated most with weight gain in both men and women, and it didn’t appear to take much. Compared to those who didn’t eat any chicken at all, those eating more than 22.8 grams of chicken a day had a significantly greater increase in their body mass indexes.1816 To put that into context, 22.8 grams is less than an ounce, which is about one single chicken nugget a day1817 or just one chicken breast once every ten days.


Chicken Out
The odds of obesity may increase by 18 percent for every 1 percent increase in calories from red meat, poultry, fish, or shellfish.1819 As we saw in the previous section, animal protein intake in general has been associated with both increased abdominal obesity and general obesity, even after taking into account other dietary and lifestyle factors.1820 We know you can’t control for everything, though. In the population studies above, poultry appeared to be the worst offender, but interventional trials are required to prove cause and effect.

In a head-to-head test of beef, pork, and chicken, no differences were noted in terms of short-term satiety.1821 What about weight changes over time? No differences there either. People were told to eat mostly beef, pork, or chicken in three-month blocks, and no differences were noted in body composition in any of the three periods.1822 Might this be like the cholesterol story? There’s a common misperception that switching from red meat to white meat lowers cholesterol, but when it was actually put to the test, no significant improvements were noted when people swapped beef, veal, and pork for chicken and fish.1823 So are we seeing the same when it comes to weight loss? The only meat shown to be less fattening than chicken in a randomized controlled trial was chicken-free chicken, a plant-based meat made from the mushroom kingdom first popularized in Europe called Quorn.

When the meat industry funded an obesity study on chicken, they pitted it against “cookies and sugar-coated chocolates.”1824 This is a classic drug industry tactic: Make your product look better by comparing it to something known to be substandard.1825 (Apparently, regular chocolate wasn’t enough to make chicken look better.) But what happens when chicken is pitted head-to-head against a real control like meatless chicken? Chicken chickens out.

Quorn-brand chickenless chicken was found to be more satiating among both lean1826 and overweight1827 individuals, cutting down on subsequent meal intake hours later. Feed people a chicken-and-rice lunch, and four and a half hours later, they eat 18 percent more of a dinner buffet than those who had been given a lunch of chicken-free chicken and rice. In terms of calories, the chicken-and-rice lunch diners ate about 1,200 calories for dinner, compared to the 1,000 dinner calories eaten by subjects after the Quorn meal. Tofu also beat out chicken in a similar manner.1828 These findings are consistent with childhood obesity research that found meat consumption seemed to double the odds of schoolchildren becoming overweight, whereas the consumption of plant-based meat products appeared to have no effect. Whole-food sources of plant protein, such as beans, did even better, though, associated with cutting the odds of kids becoming overweight in half.

TMAObesity?
Ancient doctors evidently used to use ants to diagnose people with diabetes.1830 They (the ants, not the doctors) were attracted to the sugary urine. This is an archaic example of the modern science of metabolomics, which tries to uncover the molecular signatures of disease. For example, with each breath, we exhale hundreds of different compounds.1831 Imagine how, with enough people and enough computing power, we might be able to diagnose a disease like lung cancer with some sort of Breathalyzer test. We just have to figure out the specific patterns of chemicals in the body fluids of those with and without disease. This is how Cleveland Clinic researchers discovered the role of TMAO.

The blood of patients who had experienced a heart attack or stroke was compared to the blood of those who hadn’t, and that’s how TMAO, short for trimethylamine oxide, was identified.1832 The more TMAO people had in their blood, the more likely they were to go on to suffer a heart attack, stroke, or otherwise die prematurely.1833 Where does TMAO come from? Just as short-chain fatty acids are produced by good bacteria in our gut when we eat fiber, TMAO originates from bad bacteria in our gut when we eat lots of choline (concentrated in eggs, but also lecithin supplements) or carnitine (concentrated in meat, but also some energy drinks).

If you eat eggs1834 or meat,1835 you get a bump in TMAO levels within hours, unless you recently took antibiotics that wipe out your gut flora. In that case, it can be weeks before your bad bacteria grow back. Alternately, you can prevent the growth of these bad bacteria by not feeding them in the first place. Feed a vegan a steak, and they make virtually no TMAO, presumably because they hadn’t been fostering the growth of steak-eating bacteria.1836

The egg and beef industries combined forces to fund a study showing that eating fish was even worse than their products, but TMAO levels rose within fifteen minutes after eating fish, suggesting the TMAO is preformed in the fish and may be handled differently by the body. Regardless, their own study showed TMAO levels were lowest after eating the non-fish, non-egg, non-beef control food: fruit.1837 Even relatively choline-rich plant foods don’t seem to cause a problem. For example, two ounces of pistachios every day actually seemed to cause a reduction in TMAO levels.1838

TMAO may help explain why those who eat more plant-based diets are more protected from heart disease,1839 but what about obesity? Well, obese individuals do seem to churn out more TMAO,1840 and blocking TMAO in mice protects them from weight gain, but what we care about is whether avoiding carnitine and choline-rich foods helps with weight loss in people.1841 We finally got an answer in 2018 from the POUNDS Lost Trial. (POUNDS stands for Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies.) Those with greater reductions in carnitine and choline were significantly more likely to experience weight loss and waist slimming, while those with increases in carnitine or choline were about twice as likely to fail to lose weight over a two-year period.1842 But it’s not all or nothing.

True, you can feed a vegan an eight-ounce sirloin and not get a TMAO spike,1843 but even those who eat meat on a regular basis appear to be able to modulate the populations of meat-eating bacteria in their gut. Feed people sausage, egg, and cheese biscuits before and after being on a five-day high-fat diet (55 percent calories from fat), and they end up producing more TMAO after the five-day binge.1844 This shows we may be able to shift our gut bacteria on a week-to-week basis—for better or for worse.

You (and Your Grandkids?) Are What You Eat

If you expose a pregnant cricket to a predatory wolf spider, her babies hatch exhibiting increased antipredator behavior and, as a consequence, have improved survival from wolf spider attack.1845 The mother cricket appears to be able to forewarn her babies while they are still inside her about the threat so they come out preadapted to their external environments. How is that possible? Isn’t their DNA already set in stone?

This same phenomenon happens in plants too.1846 If you take two genetically identical plants and grow one in the sun and the other in the shade, the sun-grown plant will produce seeds that grow better in the sun, while the shaded plant will produce seeds that grow better in the shade—even though the two plants are genetically identical. Same DNA, different behavior. This is the epigenetics I talked about in the Causes section, changes in how the genes we have end up expressing themselves.

Another example can be seen with vole pups birthed in the winter, who are born growing thicker coats.1847 Vole mothers are able to communicate the season to their babies in the womb and tell them to put on a heavier coat even before they’re born! And people are no different. You know how some people have different temperature tolerances, resulting in battles over the thermostat in the bedroom or the office? Whether you’re born in the tropics or in a cold environment determines how many active sweat glands you have in your skin.1848

What does this have to do with diet? Can what a pregnant woman eats permanently alter the biology of her children in terms of what genes are turned on or off throughout life? Children born during the 1944–45 Dutch famine imposed by the Nazis ended up with higher rates of obesity fifty years later.1849 It seems that the babies’ gene expression was reprogrammed before birth to expect to be born into a world of famine and to conserve calories at all cost. But when the war ended, this propensity to store fat became a disadvantage.

What pregnant women eat and don’t eat doesn’t just help determine the child’s birth weight but their future adult weights. For example, maternal animal protein intake during pregnancy (primarily from meat) appears to increase the risk their children will grow up overweight.1850 Every daily portion of meat intake during the third trimester was correlated with about an extra percent of body fat mass in their children by their sixteenth birthday, potentially increasing their risk of becoming obese later in life, and this appeared to be independent of how many calories they ate or how much they exercised.1851

Epigenetics, the science of altering the expression of our genes, is good news. That means your DNA is not your destiny. No matter your family history, some genes can be effectively turned on and off by the lifestyle choices you make, affecting you, your children, and maybe even your grandchildren. Being pregnant during the Dutch famine didn’t just lead to an increase in diseases among their kids but even, apparently, their grandkids.1852 So what a pregnant woman eats now may affect future generations. The possibility of generation-spanning effects of poor dietary conditions during pregnancy may help shine some light on our explosive epidemics of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Cutting down on meat is just one of the many ingredients of what could be considered an optimal weight-loss diet. If you continue to eat meat, your best choice would likely be wild game1853 (critically, felled with lead-free ammunition only).1854 Today, even our meat could be considered junk food. For more than a century, one of the major goals of animal agriculture has been to increase the carcass fat content of farm animals. Those with the highest fat-to-lean content are branded “prime” and command the highest prices,1855 but can end up as prime contributors to America’s caloric intake.1856 It’s not your grandma’s meat.

Take chicken, for example. In 1896, the USDA determined chicken was about 23 percent protein and less than 2 percent fat by weight,1857 which is even leaner than some wild game like venison.1858 Today, with ten times the fat, chicken has 1,000 percent more fat than it did just over a century ago.1859 These days, more than 70 percent of the calories in chicken may come from fat. The birds have been genetically manipulated through selective breeding to contain more fat than protein.1860 Chicken Little has become Chicken Big and may be making us bigger too.

LOW IN REFINED GRAINS
Going Against the Grain
Most of what we eat in America is processed junk. Ultraprocessed foods are defined as “industrial formulations which, besides salt, sugar, oils and fats, include substances not used in culinary preparations, in particular additives used to imitate sensorial qualities” of real food.1861 Think Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts. Ultraprocessed foods comprise an unbelievable 58 percent of the daily caloric intake in the United States.

The number one source of calories in the U.S. diet is refined grains like white flour, followed by added fats like oils. Then come meat and added sugars. Refined carbs and refined fats make up more than half the American diet.1862 Food-wise, grain-based desserts like cakes, cookies, pastries, and pies are our single largest calorie contributor. Second is white bread, followed by soda.1863 For our children and adolescents, it’s the same top three, but with pizza replacing the bread.1864

When proponents of low-carb diets demonize carbohydrates, public health advocates are quick to point out that it’s the source that matters—carbohydrates can mean everything from lentils to lollipops.1865 Though that’s true, the Standard American Diet sadly tends to lean more toward the lollipop end of the spectrum. We eat about three times as many calories from refined grains and added sugars as we do from all whole plant foods combined.1866 So the problem identified by the low-carb proponents is real. We are awash in refined grain garbage, but the answer isn’t to switch to high-fad, high-fat diets but rather to low-crap ones.

The consumption of refined grain products appears linked to increased weight gain, but is that just because refined grains are components of fatty foods like pizza, sugary foods like SnackWell’s, or the twin menace of fatty sugar bombs like donuts? The Harvard cohort studies involving more than one hundred thousand male and female health professionals found that refined grains like white rice and white bread were associated with weight gain independent of all the other dietary and lifestyle factors they measured.1867 This suggests that it’s not just that people who eat lots of Wonder Bread are eating more salami sandwiches or otherwise eating or living unhealthfully. The researchers estimated that every daily serving of refined grains may translate into about a four-tenths of a pound increase in weight over a four-year period. (To put that into perspective, a single large bagel may equal four servings of refined grains.1868)

Are grains in general the problem, or only refined grains? Observational studies in which people and their diets are followed over time have consistently shown whole-grain consumption not only to be neutral but even associated with better weight control.1869 Children who consumed more than one and a half servings of whole grains per day were found to have 40 percent lower odds of being obese compared with those who consumed less than one daily serving.1870 In adults, weight gain might be reduced over the long term as much as two pounds for each extra one-ounce increment in daily whole-grain consumption.1871 But is seeking out foods like brown rice and whole wheat simply a marker for a healthier lifestyle?

Only 6–8 percent of American adults follow my recommendation to eat at least three servings of whole grains a day,1872 and those who choose oatmeal for breakfast instead of bacon and eggs may also be making other healthy life choices. Indeed, high whole-grain consumers tend to be more physically active, smoke less, and consume more fruits and vegetables.1873 Statistically, one can try to control these factors like the Harvard studies did, effectively comparing nonsmoking whole-grain eaters to nonsmoking non-whole-grain eaters, all with similar exercise and diet. The result? Whole grains were still found to be associated with better weight control.1874

You can’t control for everything, though. Could it be that people who make the choice to eat whole grains also choose to wear seat belts and bike helmets, install smoke detectors, and forgo sky diving? There are lots of potential mechanisms by which whole grains might facilitate weight loss—higher fiber, lower calorie density, lower glycemic response, a slower eating rate due to more chewing1875—but you don’t know, of course, until you put it to the test.

****************************************************************************************************
Grain of Truth
There have been successful whole-grain weight-loss interventions that involved, for example, switching people from white rice to brown rice1894 or incorporating two packets of oatmeal every day versus a placebo-control hot cereal.1895 In both cases, waistlines significantly slimmed, suggesting a change in body fat. A Japanese study that measured body composition changes directly with CT scans found a significant decrease in visceral belly fat in those given whole-wheat versus white bread.1896 Indeed, if you go back and perform a meta-analysis of all the randomized controlled studies, even though an overall weight change didn’t materialize, there was a small but significant drop in body fat in the whole-grain groups.1897 Why?

Two main mechanisms have been suggested to explain the apparent benefit. Substituting whole grains for refined grains in a tightly controlled setting leads to (1) an increase in resting metabolic rate and (2) increased calorie loss through the stool.1898 The metabolic boost is attributed to the waste heat produced by the fermentation of fiber in the bowel,1899 and the extra calories flushed are due to the diminished ability of your body to extract energy from a high-fiber diet.1900 The combined effect may add up to a loss of about ninety calories a day, which almost exactly predicts the weight loss found in the Harvard cohorts over a four-year period.1901 So whole grains may indeed help with fat loss but only, perhaps, when there’s a parallel drop in refined grain junk.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

To remove refined grains from your diet is to remove America’s number one source of calories. Switching to whole grains may help reduce body fat, but there’s an even better swap. See the Wall Off Your Calories section for taking your grain game up a notch and graduate from mere whole grains to intact whole grains, such as oat groats (also known as hull-less or hulled oats).


LOW IN SALT
Don’t Shake on It
One of the most dramatic changes in our diets has been the skyrocketing intake of salt. For most of human existence, we were only getting the pinch of salt a day naturally found in whole foods.1902 Now, thanks mostly to processed foods, we’re exposed to ten times more than our bodies were meant to handle.1903 What role might this play in our obesity epidemic?

For nearly forty years, studies have linked salt intake to excess body fat.1904 A 2017 meta-analysis of more than a dozen such studies found that higher sodium consumption was associated with nearly a two-inch-larger waist.1905 A subsequent study found an extra pound of body fat for each quarter-teaspoon-higher salt intake a day.1906 Children with the saltiest diets may have double the odds for abdominal obesity,1907 but how do we know it’s the salt itself? Think of some childhood favorites: pizza, potato chips, mac ’n cheese. They are packed with sodium, but they’re also packed with calories. Perhaps the only reason sodium intake is correlated with obesity is because high salt and calories tend to travel together in the same foods.1908

Why does the food industry add salt to so many products? It’s simple: to make processed food more palatable so you’ll eat more of it. Which are you more likely to overeat? Unsalted nuts or salted nuts? Unsalted pretzels or salted pretzels? Salty foods can have an addictive quality. The overlap in pleasure circuitry within the brain between our appetites for salt and the effects of opioids and cocaine has led some to speculate that drug addiction is a hijacking of our inborn salt cravings that kept us alive through the long millennia before the advent of saltshakers.1909 Now, those same salt cravings are killing us (by contributing to cardiovascular disease1910 and stomach cancer1911 risk), but are they also making us fat?

Salt doesn’t just make us want to eat more but drink more as well. And what do most Americans over age two drink on a given day? Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda.1912,1913 Based on studies measuring fluid intake after manipulating the salt content of people’s diets, Americans might end up drinking an estimated forty billion fewer soft drinks per year if we cut our sodium intake in half.1914 That’s a lot of calories.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************

Pinch an Inch
Until recently, that was all we thought was going on: Salt increases body fat by causing us to eat and drink more calories. But now, there is growing evidence that there may be a more direct link between sodium intake and obesity.1915 Studies controlling for total caloric intake including sweetened beverages still found a link between salt intake and body fat or obesity in adults, children, and adolescents,1916,1917,1918,1919 but these studies are fraught with difficulties.

Salt can make you retain water, which can affect bioimpedance measurements of body composition.1920 But studies that have used more rigorous measures like x-ray or MRI scanning have also found a link between salt and body fat.1921 It’s also hard to accurately estimate how much salt people are eating without having them carry a jug to collect their urine all day, or how many calories they’re consuming without carrying out expensive “doubly labeled” water experiments. But again, even studies that have used these kinds of gold-standard techniques still found a link between salt intake and body fat, independent of how many calories people were eating.1922 Most of these studies were cross-sectional in nature, only a snapshot in time. When researchers followed hundreds of individuals over time, their salt consumption didn’t predict changes in overall body weight in terms of the numbers on a scale, but all the while, body fat appeared to be increasing while their fat-free mass shrank. After controlling for a number of potential confounding factors, those who ate the most salt appeared to shift their body compositions to more fat and less lean tissue.1923

Nearly all of these are observational studies and so can’t prove cause and effect. Maybe high-salt consumers practice other bad health behaviors like sedentary living. Studies have controlled for physical activity,1924 but you can’t control for everything. The only interventional studies have been performed on rodents. Yes, you can fatten rats just by boosting their salt intakes,1925 but the opposite effect has been described in mice.1926 So are we more like rats or mice? Clinical researchers use animals to run tightly controlled experiments, but no matter how good the data, they always end up on the wrong species.

There is one recent human experiment that could provide a mechanism by which salt may contribute to obesity. When people were switched to a low-salt diet, the levels in their blood of the gut hormone ghrelin dropped, and when shifted to a high-salt diet, their ghrelin levels shot up.1927 Ghrelin, the so-called hunger hormone I discussed in the High in Fiber-Rich Foods section, is the target of attempts by drug companies to create an anti-obesity vaccine,1928 but we may be able to help block its action naturally by lowering our sodium intake.

Some are so convinced that salt is such a key player in our obesity epidemic they have suggested “partial resection of the nerve branches innervating the lingual mesolimbic receptor system”—in other words, cutting the nerves going to the salt-sensing taste buds of morbidly obese individuals.1929 The link between salt and weight remains much too speculative for such a drastic approach, but given that sodium consumption is already considered the leading dietary risk factor for death on the planet,1930 there’s reason enough to cut down, and it may just have the happy side benefit of facilitating fat loss—no scalpel needed.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
FOOD FOR THOUGHT

A New England Journal of Medicine editorial entitled “Compelling Evidence for Public Health Action to Reduce Salt Intake” argued that since about 75 percent of salt exposure comes from manufactured foods, “the individual approach is probably impractical”1931—as if the consumption of processed foods is somehow preordained. But we not only have control over how much salt we add at home, we also have control over which foods we buy.

In the very least, we can try to steer away from the worst offenders. For adults over fifty, the number one source of sodium intake is bread. For younger adults, the greatest contribution of sodium to the diet is not canned soups, pretzels, or potato chips but a seemingly unprocessed food—chicken.1932 Salt is actually injected into the chicken meat, in part to solubilize the muscle proteins to a gel for optimum texture.1933 The commentary notes that although sodium levels are going down in some sectors of the food industry, the opposite seems to be happening in the meat industry, where “the addition of salt to poultry, meats, and fish appears to be occurring on a massive scale.”1934 Impractical or not, we can shop for low-sodium options, eat out less, and stop adding salt in the kitchen and dining room.

****************************************************************************************************
LOW INSULIN INDEX
The Hormone of Plenty
Insulin can be thought of as the “hormone of calorie prosperity.”1936 After a meal, our blood is awash with calories. The starches we eat are broken down into simple sugars, the proteins into amino acids, and the fats into fatty acids, all of which are absorbed into our bloodstreams. Insulin then goes to work to distribute and store this bounty. It moves the blood sugars into our muscles to fuel our movement, gets our cells to take up the amino acids to build new proteins, and stockpiles circulating fatty acids into our fat stores. Insulin drives fat storage both by directing fat from our bloodstreams into our fat cells and by telling our fat cells to stop burning calories. Insulin is, after all, the signal of abundance.

Should we become obese, fat can spill out from our overbloated fat cells back into our bloodstreams and get lodged in our muscles. When this happens, it can interfere with insulin signaling, causing our muscles to become less responsive to insulin, a phenomenon known as insulin resistance. Normally, our muscles take up blood sugar in response to insulin, but if they become resistant to the effects of insulin, the sugar remains in the blood and can build up to dangerous levels. To prevent this, our bodies produce even more insulin to force more blood sugar into our muscles. But all that extra insulin in our system can cause additional fat storage and result in a vicious cycle: obesity leading to insulin resistance, which leads to higher insulin levels that then lead to more obesity and even more insulin resistance.

When insulin resistance gets so bad that our insulin production can no longer keep up and overcome it, our blood sugars start creeping up and we become prediabetic and then progress to full-blown diabetes. Instead of treating the cause—insulin resistance—with lifestyle medicine to try to reverse the diabetes, what do most doctors do? Prescribe even more insulin, which can perpetuate the cycle. With injections, insulin levels can be forced so high that even resistant muscles will concede, but what effect will all that extra insulin have on our fat stores? Within the first year of starting insulin, type 2 diabetics typically gain between seven and twenty pounds of “insulin-associated weight gain.”


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
The Insulin-Obesity Cycle
Obesity can kick-start the vicious cycle leading to the insulin resistance, which leads to elevated insulin levels, which leads to more obesity, as illustrated in the figure below.

You can also become insulin resistant without being obese. The fat that ends up clogging our muscles and causing insulin resistance can come from the fat we wear or the fat we eat. Normally, we may have as little as 100 μmol/l of free fat floating around in our bloodstreams at any one time, but those who are obese may have up to 800 μmol/l. However, skinny people can reach 800 μmol/l just eating a high-fat diet. In other words, a thin person eating a low-carb diet can have the same level of fat in their blood that an obese person does.

Infuse fat into people’s veins through an IV, and, by using a high-tech type of MRI scanner, you can show in real time the buildup of fat in muscle cells within hours, accompanied by an increase in insulin resistance. The same thing happens when you put people on a high-fat diet.1939 Feed folks even a single high-fat meal, and within six hours, their insulin sensitivity can be cut in half, meaning their insulin resistance shoots up.1940 Do this day after day, and insulin levels can rise to compensate, which can then lead to weight gain as the vicious cycle starts turning.1941

Some people are born with higher-than-normal insulin levels and naturally have a higher propensity to gain weight, suggesting that the cycle can also start with an elevated insulin level, leading to elevated obesity and, subsequently, elevated insulin resistance.1942

The causal role of high insulin levels in obesity was established in a study published in 2018 entitled “Reducing Insulin … in Adults Reverses Diet-Induced Weight Gain,” but the adults they were talking about were adult mice.1943 You can prove insulin drives obesity by genetically engineering a low-insulin mouse that is essentially immune to obesity, but how can you prove it in people?1944 The closest we’ve come is the demonstration that drugs that lower insulin levels do cause weight loss in obese adult humans,1945,1946 but the drugs also may have direct effects on body fat that could account for the benefit.1947 So while we don’t know for certain, I think there’s enough evidence to try to keep our insulin levels within the normal range.


Break the Cycle by Improving Insulin Sensitivity
One way to lower our insulin levels is to make our insulin work better. The reason our bodies pump out so much insulin is to overcome any resistance, so by improving the insulin sensitivity of our muscles, we can make a little insulin go a long way. How? You can do it with exercise (both endurance and resistance training), weight loss, or reducing your intake of fat—but not necessarily all types of fat.1949 While the monounsaturated fats concentrated in nuts, olives, and avocados appear more likely to be detoxified or safely stored away, the saturated fats concentrated in meat, dairy, and junk can create the toxic breakdown products in our muscle cells thought responsible for the development of insulin resistance.1950

Experimentally shifting people from animal fats to plant fats can improve insulin sensitivity even without changing the overall quantity of fat eaten.1951 Thinking this may help explain why those eating more plant-based diets have less insulin resistance, researchers at Imperial College London set out to compare the amount of fat clogging the muscle cells of vegans versus omnivores.1952 So as not to give the vegan group an unfair advantage, the researchers recruited omnivores who were as slim as the vegans. The researchers wanted to know if plant-based eating had a direct benefit beyond simply indirectly pulling fat out of the muscles by helping people lose weight in general. The vegans were found to have significantly less fat trapped in their muscle cells, which can translate into less insulin resistance and lower insulin levels.1953

So can switching fats help with weight loss? Amazingly, Australian researchers found that even if you feed people about the same number of calories and the same amount of fat, but switch out meat and butterfat for olive oil, nuts, and avocados, you lose nearly six more pounds of fat in a single month.1954 You can certainly overdo plant fats, though. On high-fat diets, the type of fat appears to matter less.1955 Have people drink nearly a half cup of oil, and you can temporarily triple their insulin resistance in a matter of hours.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Break the Cycle by Lowering Insulin Spikes
In addition to making our insulin work better by improving our sensitivity to it, we can lower our insulin exposure by choosing foods that cause less of an insulin surge. Although those who are born with1957 or develop higher-than-normal insulin spikes after meals are at elevated risk of weight gain1958 and obesity,1959 anyone can get an exaggerated insulin response to Wonder Bread.

High glycemic loads are the primary stimulus for insulin release as our bodies desperately try to sock away blood sugar from the rapidly digested sugars and starches, as I described in the Low Glycemic Load section. Randomized controlled trials clearly show that swapping out refined grains in favor of whole grains reduces insulin spikes1960 (likely due to the fiber content).1961 Remember, though, insulin doesn’t just deal with carbohydrates after a meal but protein and fat as well.

To their credit, low-carb and paleo diet advocates identify insulin as playing a role in the obesity epidemic, but they often don’t appear to recognize the broader scope of insulin triggers. Since carbs increase insulin, the argument goes, we should eat lots of meat, which is just fat and protein with zero carbs. That wouldn’t cause an increase in insulin, right? Wrong. We’ve known for more than a half century that if you feed people a steak, their insulin levels go up.1962 Pretty much pure protein (like whey powder) and pure fat can have a similar effect.1963 Have people eat some lentils with butter, and you get a 60 percent higher insulin reaction to pure sugar compared to lentils alone.1964 That’s why we need more than a glycemic index. We need an insulin index. We need to feed people dozens of different foods and just measure what kind of insulin reactions they get. And that’s exactly what researchers did.

What do you think causes the biggest insulin reaction: a large apple, an orange, a cup of oatmeal, a cup and a half of white-flour pasta, four Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies, a bunless burger, or a fish fillet?

Is that your final answer?

Well, surprisingly, beef and fish cause more insulin to be released.1965,1966 In terms of meat, the original study looked only at beef and fish, but subsequent studies found the insulin response to chicken and pork was just as high.1967 It turns out meat protein causes almost exactly as much insulin release as pure sugar.1968 So, based on their own logic, low carbers and paleo folks should be reaching for big bowls of pasta rather than meat.

Those eating plant-based diets average significantly lower insulin levels and have less insulin resistance, even compared to nonvegetarians at the same body weight.1969,1970 In fact, those who eat meat have up to 50 percent higher insulin levels in their bloodstreams.1971,1972 Might that just be because they’re more sedentary or something? Researchers from the University of Memphis decided to put it to the test by placing men and women on a plant-based diet and got significant drops in insulin within just three weeks.1973 But add some egg whites to the plant-based diet, and you can cause a “dramatic”1974 rise in insulin output—as much as 60 percent within just four days.1975

Fish and poultry may be even worse than the egg whites.1976 Add about half a can of tuna to some spaghetti, and induce about a 70 percent higher insulin spike in diabetics.1977 Skinless chicken breast and white rice cause an insulin reaction closer to straight sugar than rice alone.1978 Compared to chicken, the meat-free tastes-like-chicken Quorn causes up to 41 percent less of an insulin reaction within fifteen minutes.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Low-Carb and Paleo Diets Put to the Test

In a study out of MIT, researchers increased the carbohydrate intake of subjects by up to hundreds of grams a day, yet their insulin levels went down.1980 How is that possible? The researchers weren’t feeding people jelly beans and sugar cookies; they fed them whole plant foods—lots of whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables.

What if you instead put someone on a very-low-carb diet like an Atkins diet? Low-carb advocates such as Dr. Eric Westman, author of the New Atkins Diet books and the person who took over after the old Dr. Atkins died, assumed doing so would lower insulin levels.1981 But what they found was that there is no significant drop in insulin levels on very-low-carb diets. Instead, there is a significant rise in bad LDL cholesterol levels1982 and a significant crippling of artery function,1983 which helps explain why those eating more low-carb diets tend to live significantly shorter lives.1984

Atkins is an easy target, though. No matter how many newer-than-new Atkins diets come out, it’s still old news. What about the paleo diet? The paleo movement gets a lot of things right. It tells people to ditch dairy and donuts, eat lots of fruits, nuts, and vegetables, and cut out a lot of processed junk. But a study published in the International Journal of Exercise Science has raised concerns.

Researchers took young healthy people and put them on a paleo diet along with a CrossFit-based, high-intensity circuit training exercise program. If you lose enough weight by any means, whether by exercise, stomach stapling, chemotherapy, or a hearty cocaine habit, you can temporarily drop your cholesterol levels no matter what you eat. After ten weeks of hard-core workouts and weight loss on the paleo diet, however, the study participants’ LDL cholesterol still went up—and it was even worse for those who started out the healthiest. Those who started the study with optimal levels (under 70) had a 20 percent elevation in this leading risk factor for heart disease, our number one killer.1985 The researchers concluded that “the Paleo diet’s deleterious impact on blood lipids [fats] was not only significant, but substantial enough to counteract the … improvements commonly seen with improved fitness and body composition.”

Exercise is supposed to make things better.

On the other hand, put people on a plant-based diet and a modest, mostly walking-based exercise program, and within three weeks, their bad cholesterol can drop 20 percent and their insulin levels can plummet 30 percent, despite a 75–80 percent carbohydrate diet.1986 In contrast, the paleo diet appeared to have “negated the positive effects of exercise.”


****************************************************************************************************
Animal Protein vs. Plant Protein
What about plant proteins? Although isolated soy protein causes an insulin surge similar to meat, dairy, and eggs, comparing foods to foods,1988 adding fish or egg whites to rice amplifies the insulin reaction, but adding tofu does not.1989 Similarly, a whole soy food significantly lowers insulin levels, but soy protein supplements do not.1990

Add tuna to mashed potatoes, and the insulin reaction is about 50 percent higher than eating the mashed potatoes alone.1991 Adding broccoli instead, however, results in the insulin response being cut about 40 percent within the first thirty minutes.1992 This didn’t appear to be a fiber effect, since giving the equivalent amount of isolated broccoli fiber provided no significant benefit. The differential effect of plant versus animal protein has been attributed to their contrasting amino acid profiles.1993

Plant proteins tend to be lower in the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and the sulfur-containing amino acid methionine, which both have been associated with insulin resistance.1994 To date, most of the research on restricting methionine intake has been about preventing cancer growth and slowing aging,1995 but more recently, it has been presented as a “useful nutritional strategy” to combat insulin resistance.1996 Sticking to plant-based sources of protein would cut methionine intake about in half, resulting in significantly lower blood levels.1997 As such, following purely plant-based diets has been put forth as a feasible “life extension strategy,”1998 but there are myriad reasons why plant-based diets have been shown to improve insulin resistance.1999 You can’t prove methionine is playing a specific role until you isolate it out. To date, the trials demonstrating better insulin sensitivity on diets that just specifically restrict methionine have all been done on rodents,2000 but that’s not the case for branched-chain amino acids.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
What Are Amino Acids?

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are about twenty different kinds,2001 similar to the number of letters in the alphabet. Just as different sentences can be made from different combinations of letters, different proteins are made from stringing together different sequences of the various amino acids. Three of the amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—have fatty side-chains that branch off from their central structure and are thereby referred to as branched-chain amino acids.

Branch Out Your Proteins
When researchers analyzed differences in the blood among people with different insulin levels,2002 in addition to finding the saturated fat connection, they uncovered that the levels of branched-chain amino acids in the blood were correlated with insulin resistance.2003 A number of potential mechanisms were identified, from toxic metabolites2004 to the stimulation of a fat-generating enzyme complex.2005 Since that initial publication, an “overwhelming” number of studies2006 have consistently shown that blood and urine levels of branched-chain amino acids are tied to insulin resistance. This doesn’t necessarily mean that decreasing intake of BCAAs will help, though, since there are other factors that influence BCAA levels in the blood.2007

Short-term dietary tweaks like swapping out meat lasagna for vegan lasagna can lower levels a bit,2008 but even those sticking entirely to plant proteins only have about 5 percent lower BCAA levels in their bloodstreams.2009 Is that enough to make a difference? Well, meat consumption is associated with increased insulin levels,2010 weight gain,2011 and higher diabetes risk,2012 and substituting in even just 5 percent of plant protein for animal protein may decrease diabetes risk by 23 percent.2013 These data circumstantially support the contention that insulin resistance could help explain the meat-obesity connection,2014 but you don’t know if amino acids are playing a starring role until you run the experiment and put it to the test.

Indeed, just like you can make someone insulin resistant by infusing fat into their bloodstreams, you can do the same thing by infusing amino acids.2015 Down a protein drink of just straight whey and water, and it can cause insulin resistance within hours.2016 Give some vegans BCAAs, and you can make them as insulin resistant as omnivores.2017 Or you can do it the other way: Take some omnivores and put them through even just a “48-hour vegan diet challenge,” and you can produce significant improvements in metabolic health. After two days on a healthy plant-based diet, not only did cholesterol and triglycerides drop but so did insulin and insulin resistance, presumed to be due in part to the “strong modulatory effect” on circulating BCAA levels. Because the benefits appeared so rapidly, the researchers suggested metabolic benefits could be gotten from an “intermittent vegan diet” or even the “flexitarian approach” of alternating between animal and plant protein choices.2018

In that case, does protein manipulation then translate to weight loss? To see if lowering amino acids would improve insulin resistance—and, ultimately, accelerate weight loss—researchers put a group of overweight men on a “protein-restricted diet,” which is to say a normal protein diet. The recommended dietary allowance for protein is about 50 grams a day (46 for women, 56 for men).2019 The researchers took men who were averaging twice that—112 grams, which is about the average of what many American men get2020—and randomized them down to 64 grams of protein a day. They were still getting more protein than they needed.

The levels of branched-chain amino acids circulating in the lower-protein group dropped as suspected, but did they lose weight? Both diets were designed to have the same number of calories, so six weeks later, both groups should weigh the same, right? The body weight and fat mass of the regular protein group didn’t change, but the lower protein group lost about six pounds.2021 BCAAs may explain why those randomized to a plant-based diet eliminate significantly more of the deeper, more dangerous fat, even when taking in the same number of calories.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Given the metabolic harms of excess BCAA exposure, leaders in the field have suggested the invention of drugs to block BCAA absorption, which “may represent a translatable and sustainable approach to promote metabolic health and treat diabetes and obesity without reducing caloric intake.”2023 Or we can just not eat so many branched-chain amino acids in the first place. BCAAs are found mostly in meat, including chicken and fish, dairy products, and eggs.2024 This is one postulated explanation of why animal protein has been associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas plant protein appears protective.2025

Figuring out the “appropriate upper limits” of animal protein intake “may offer a great chance for the prevention of T2D [type 2 diabetes] and obesity,”2026 but it need not be all or nothing. Cutting down on dairy consumption may not be enough,2027 but even “intermittently substituting vegan meals in otherwise animal-based diets” may be beneficial in this regard.2028

From an insulin standpoint, the worst of both worlds would presumably be the combination of animal protein and a high glycemic load—think burger on a bun, meat and potatoes, or a deli meat sandwich. The joint induction of insulin resistance and spiking blood sugars is a bad combo.2029

The advice to avoid eating animal protein and refined carbs together was one of the tenets of the “food combining” dogma popularized in books like Fit for Life. Though the rationale given at the time was “frankly laughable”2030 from a scientific standpoint, they may have stumbled onto something. When people were randomized to a “low-insulin-response” diet that included advice to separate out the consumption of foods rich in carbohydrate or protein at different meals, their insulin levels dropped and they lost an extra six pounds over twelve weeks compared to people on a diet designed with the same number of calories but no special insulin-reducing aspects.2031

Thankfully, the combo effect doesn’t appear to extend to legumes. Despite being rich in protein and starch, the insulin index of legumes, such as beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils, appears to parallel their very low glycemic index.2032 So to reduce insulin levels to potentially facilitate weight loss: Rule #1: Avoid high-glycemic foods; Rule #2: Make plant protein your preference; and Rule #3: When you do eat animal protein, try to pay particular attention to Rule #1.

MICROBIOME-FRIENDLY
Tenant Building
Surrounded on all sides by fattening temptations, our obesogenic—obesity-generating—environment is hard to escape,2033 though some people do manage to navigate their svelte selves through. If the epidemic were purely due to external factors, wouldn’t everyone be obese? Some individuals seem to be more susceptible than others, which suggests a genetic component. Partial heritability is supported by studies of twins and adopted kids, but the genes we’ve identified only account for a small amount of the variation in body size between individuals.2034 Might a role be played by the variation in our “other genome”? That is, the DNA contained in all the different microbes that inhabit our bodies? We have one hundred times more bacterial genes inside us than human genes.2035

We have trillions of bacteria living inside each of us. One professor emeritus went as far as to say, “Nous sommes toutes les bacteries,” which translates to “We are all bacteria,”2036 a provocative way of acknowledging there are more bacterial cells and genes in our own bodies than there are human cells and genes. And most of those bacteria live in our gut.

The colon used to be viewed as merely a retention tank for waste and that water absorption was its big biological function.2037 Our ignorance arose from “difficult access to the large intestine”2038 and the fact that we weren’t able to culture most of the gut flora outside of the body. About three-quarters of gut microbes fail to grow under standard laboratory conditions,2039 and so remained the “dark matter” of fecal matter.

How do you study something you can’t study?

Today, we have advanced DNA fingerprinting techniques to unravel the mystery. The first time scientists attempted to sequence all the genes of a bacterium, it took thirteen years.2040 These days, the same feat might take only a few hours.2041 With all this new knowledge, what we learned is that each one of us can be thought of as a superorganism, a kind of human-microbe hybrid.2042

The human colon has been considered the most biodense ecosystem in the world, meaning there’s more life concentrated in our colons than anywhere else on Earth.2043 Many probably think that stool is composed primarily of undigested food, but most of it—about 75 percent—is pure bacteria.2044 Trillions and trillions of them—about half a trillion per teaspoon, in fact.2045 We are bacteria factories. As Neil deGrasse Tyson put it, “More bacteria live and work in one linear centimeter of your lower colon than all the humans who have ever lived.”2046

What’s in it for us? What do we get for housing these trillions of tenants? Rent is paid in the form of boosting our immune systems, balancing our hormones, improving digestion, and making vitamins for us. We feed them, and they feed us right back. Our gut bacteria have been referred to as a “forgotten organ.”2047 They weigh as much as one of our kidneys and are as metabolically active as our livers.2048 They may have control over as many as one in ten metabolites measured in the bloodstream.2049 We have about twenty-three thousand genes,2050 but, collectively, our gut bacteria have about three million genes. Our gut flora don’t just constitute any organ but perhaps the “main organ” involved in the cause of obesity.


A Bitter Pill
How do we know gut bacteria have anything to do with gaining weight? More than seventy years ago, we learned that low doses of antibiotics fattened farm animals,2052 but, when penicillin is fed to “bubble boy” chicks hatched without any gut bacteria into a sterile environment, the antibiotics have no effect on their weights.2053 That was how it was first discovered microbes could affect body weight.

According to the FDA, animal agriculture now feeds about thirty million pounds of antibiotics to livestock every year,2054 four times the amount sold to treat human infections.2055 This has raised concerns about the fostering of antibiotic resistance,2056 but if these drugs can cause weight gain in farm animals, might exposure to antibiotic residues left in meat contribute to the human obesity epidemic? Public health scientists have raised this as a theoretical possibility,2057 especially given the rise in fish farming.2058 It can take as much as a half pound of antibiotics to produce just one pound of salmon,2059 for example, which helps explain why the researchers found most of the samples from common seafood in the United States tested positive for trace amounts of antibiotics.2060 The dose consumed would be minuscule compared to that which doctors too often overprescribe, though.

The average American child may receive three courses of antibiotics by age two, about ten courses by the age of ten, and around seventeen antibiotics courses by age twenty. This is more than twice that of countries like Sweden, suggesting much of the prescribed antibiotic use in the United States is unnecessary.2061 The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that as many as ten million antibiotic prescriptions are given out unnecessarily every year.2062 Undoubtedly, antibiotics can be lifesaving wonder drugs, but they should be used judiciously—not only to prevent the development of resistant strains but because even a common seven-day regimen can alter your gut flora for years.2063 What role might this be playing in the obesity epidemic?

A compilation of more than a dozen studies involving about a half million children found that exposure to antibiotics during infancy was associated with an increased risk of becoming overweight during childhood.2064 And the greater the exposure, the greater the risk.2065 Each additional course of antibiotics in early life was found to be associated with a 7 percent increased risk of our kids becoming overweight.2066 How do we know it’s cause and effect, though? Maybe parents who overfeed their kids are more likely to pester doctors for prescriptions?2067

Studies have shown that, compared to control subjects, those treated with antibiotics gain more weight—and in some cases, much more weight, like an average of nine pounds over a control group.2068 The controls didn’t need antibiotics, though, because they weren’t sick. Perhaps simply having an infection may lead to weight gain,2069 or even having an infection cleared up. For example, a group of patients with a stomach infection called Helicobacter pylori were randomized to either antibiotics or placebo. The antibiotic group gained more weight, but maybe it was due to their appetites being restored because their infections were cleared.2070 How can we know for certain?

To truly put it to the test, you’d have to randomize healthy people to either antibiotics or sugar pills. Just such a study was published on U.S. Navy recruits in 1955.2071 Those on the antibiotics gained about a pound a month more than the placebo group, suggesting that our gut flora do indeed play a role in controlling our weight.


Eating for Trillions
When antibiotics are necessary, doctors can try to limit their collateral damage by using a more laser-like approach in their prescribing, rather than carpet-bombing germs with broad-spectrum antibiotics. There’s even been a proposal to “bank every healthy child’s fecal specimen” so we can chase each antibiotic course with a dose of their pretreatment microbes.2072 Another controversial suggestion involves how to best start our children’s gut flora out on the right foot.

Most of the microbes populating our colons first originate from our mothers’ vaginal flora, which we acquire during birth. What about those born via cesarean section? Instead of getting their mothers’ vaginal flora, infants born by cesarean delivery start out with microbiomes more closely representing that of the operating room.2073 This may help explain why children born by C-section have a 33 percent greater risk of childhood obesity.2074 With so much at stake, “vaginal seeding” has been proposed, in which maternal vaginal fluids are transferred into the mouths of cesarean babies. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes the practice for fear of transmitting any STDs,2075 but a study in which women were first screened for such infections found that vaginal seeding was successful in establishing a more natural gut flora in their infants.2076

Breast milk naturally contains special compounds that can nourish the infant’s microbiome, which may help explain why breastfed infants are less likely to become obese as children.2077 This benefit appears to be limited to those who didn’t receive antibiotics during the breastfeeding period, however, underscoring the importance of our gut flora for weight control.2078 Breast is best, but after weaning, what should we eat, and what should we avoid to promote a healthy, slimming microbiome?


They Are What We Eat
Every food choice we make may affect the growth of trillions of bacteria.

I’ve already explored some of the effects of what we feed our flora, from the benefits of the short-chain fatty acids produced when we feed them fiber to the risks from the TMAO when we feed them meat or eggs. What we eat affects not only what our gut microbes make but also which microbes exist. Remember the steak-munching vegan here? Just as they didn’t harbor the bad bugs that make TMAO, those who’ve been living off cheeseburgers and milkshakes their whole lives may take months to realize the full potential of increased fiber consumption as they slowly build up the communities of fiber-eating organisms.2079

No known single microbial signature exists for obesity,2080 but when the microbiomes of obese and nonobese individuals are compared, there are some specific bugs associated with more, or less, weight gain over time. One influential study found eight species of bacteria that appeared protective against weight gain, and they all ate fiber.2081

There’s a hormone called FIAF, which stands for fasting-induced adipose factor. When you fast, your body stops storing fat and instead starts burning it off. FIAF is one of the hormones that signal our bodies to make this switch. This may be one way our gut flora manage our weight. Some bacteria repress this hormone, thereby increasing the tendency to store fat, whereas the short-chain fatty acids made by our fiber-eating bacteria can boost FIAF production.2082

Eating fiber-rich foods has the double benefit of directly resulting in the formation of short-chain fatty acids and selectively cultivating the bugs that make it. Ounce for ounce, the colon contents of those eating more plant-based diets have nearly three times the capacity to form short-chain fatty acids.2083 In this way, eating healthfully not only provides more raw materials for short-chain fatty acid production but improved microbial machinery to churn out more of it. In contrast, putting people on a low-carb diet can slash short-chain fatty acid production by up to 75 percent.2084

Another way your gut flora can differentially affect your weight is through enhanced or reduced energy harvest. Some types of bacteria are better than others at extracting calories from our gut contents. Feed a group of people the exact same 2,400 calories, and based on the calorie content of their stools, some retain 2,350 of those calories, while others may only hold on to about 2,200.2085 Calories that end up in the toilet are calories that can’t end up on our hips.

Certain obesity-related bacteria in your colon can take your waste, break it down even further, and release calories that are then absorbed back into your bloodstream. Just when your body is trying to get rid of all your waste, the calories can come bouncing right back. Take, for example, a grouping of bacteria called Firmicutes. A 20 percent relative increase in Firmicutes was associated with an increase of about 150 calories in daily calorie absorption, whereas a 20 percent increase in a different grouping of bacteria was associated with a decrease of about 150 daily calories.2086 This may help explain some of the edge those eating more plant-based diets have for weight control, as DNA fingerprinting of vegetarian feces has found significantly more of the lean-type bacteria.

****************************************************************************************************
Change Your Diet, Change Your Microbiome
More than two thousand species of bacteria have been characterized in the human gut, yet each of us tends to have a unique collection.2088 Remarkably, however, all of humanity appears to cluster toward one of two broad categories called enterotypes.2089 Enterotypes are not like blood types, which put us distinctly into specific immutable categories.2090 Instead, our gut flora exist in more of a continuous gradient with tendencies to drift one way or another. And when it comes to our gut flora, there are apparently two types of people in the world: those who grow mostly Bacteroides species and those who grow mostly Prevotella.

It’s pretty amazing that despite so many different types of gut bacteria, people tend to settle into just one of two groups. Researchers figure our guts are like ecosystems.2091 There are a lot of different species of animals on the planet, for example, but they aren’t randomly distributed. You don’t find dolphins in the desert. In the desert, you find desert species, and in the jungle, you find jungle species, because each ecosystem has different selective pressures like rainfall or temperature. The enterotype data suggest there are two types of colon ecosystems, so you can split humanity into people whose guts grow a lot of Bacteroides-type bacteria and those whose guts are better homes for Prevotella species.

Your enterotype doesn’t seem to depend on where you live, whether you are male or female, or how old you are. What matters is what you eat. Researchers looked at more than one hundred different food factors, and it turns out Bacteroides and Prevotella are kind of opposites. Bacteroides’ prevalence is correlated to the consumption of components found in animal foods, such as animal fat, cholesterol, and animal protein, whereas Prevotella are linked to constituents found almost exclusively in plant foods.2092 Prevotella are fiber-feeders and pump out more short-chain fatty acids.2093

Native Africans who eat largely plant-based diets tend to have a Prevotella enterotype, while African Americans eating a typical Western diet tend to be in the Bacteroides camp. This may help explain why African Americans have fifty times more colon cancer, since short-chain fatty acids don’t just protect against obesity but have anticancer properties as well.2094 The question then becomes: How long does it take to shift your gut flora from one enterotype to the other?

Researchers started giving Africans an American-style diet and African Americans a much more plant-based, African-style diet. Perhaps skeptical that Americans would actually eat real food, the researchers made exchanges like swapping out hot dogs in favor of veggie dogs rather than feeding them more typical African fare (such as phutu, a grain-based porridge).2095 Still, within only two weeks, remarkable mirror-image changes were found in the gut flora in the respective groups, with the colonic health of the Africans taking a dive and that of the Americans significantly improving.2096

What’s the absolute fastest you can change your microbiome? Researchers came up with diets from both extremes to find out: a plant-based diet rich in grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables, and an “animal-based” diet composed of meats, eggs, and cheeses. Within twenty-four hours of switching between the two diets, there was a substantial shift. So, to answer the question: basically as soon as food hits our colons. What happened, for example, to the lifelong vegetarian who got placed on the animal-based diet? Predictably, he started out Prevotella, but within days, his Prevotella-to-Bacteroides ratio completely flipped. His entire gut flora got turned on its head.2097

The fact that our gut can so rapidly switch between herbivorous and carnivorous functional profiles presumably has evolutionary benefits. If you take down a mammoth and eat meat for a couple of days before reverting to plants, you want your gut to be able to adjust. This flexibility is manifest in the diversity of human diets to this day, but what’s the healthier state to be in most of the time? On the plant-based diet, the subjects’ guts yielded more protective short-chain fatty acids, fewer carcinogens, and less of the rotten-egg gas hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is made by pathogens such as Bilophila wadsworthia, which increased on the animal-based diet. That stinks because … well … it stinks and because hydrogen sulfide can damage DNA.2098 (The only pathogens found more of on the plant-based diet were plant viruses such as those that attack spinach.2099)

The benefits of plant-based eating need not be all or nothing, though. Those highly adherent to a Mediterranean diet filled with fruits, vegetables, and beans, while averaging no meat (including fish), eggs,2100 or dairy on a day-to-day basis, had comparable short-chain fatty acid levels to vegans, even though the Mediterranean diet adherents weren’t completely plant-based all the time.


****************************************************************************************************
Food Additives That May Make Your Gut Leak

Our skin keeps the outside world outside, and so does the lining of our gut. Should our intestinal barrier break down, bacteria can slip into our bloodstreams and trigger inflammation. This may not only spark inflammatory bowel diseases2114 but also, potentially, obesity.2115 How can we keep our gut from getting leaky?

Fiber appears to play a vital role in maintaining our gut barrier,2116 but how? We have specialized cells lining our gut that secrete a mucus layer that forms our first line of barrier defense. When we starve our microbial selves by eating a fiber-depleted diet, our famished flora may turn to munching our mucus as an alternative fuel source and thereby undermine our defenses.2117 Researchers were able to re-create layers of human intestinal cells in a lab and showed that E. coli bacteria could be prevented from breaching the barrier by dripping fiber onto the cells at dietary doses. (They used plantains and broccoli.)

The researchers also made a second discovery. Bacterial invasion was facilitated by the food additive polysorbate 80,2118 an emulsifier commonly found in such processed foods as ice cream, whipped toppings, and cottage cheese.2119 Food additives like polysorbate 80 and carboxymethylcellulose (a thickener sometimes found in foods such as ice cream, salad dressing, and sauces) have in fact been shown to cause weight gain in mice, but they’ve never been tested directly in people.2120 Until they’ve been proven to be safe, you may want to scrutinize ingredient labels, as well as make sure to rinse your dishes. Traces of dishwashing detergent could have similar adverse effects. Apparently, some people wash dishes and then just leave them to dry without rinsing them, which some gastroenterology researchers have suggested is probably not a good idea.


//
The Three Ps
The Three Ps for gut health restoration are prebiotics, polyphenols, and probiotics.2132 Polyphenols are a class of phytonutrients (health-promoting plant compounds) that have long been investigated as potential candidates to explain some of the benefits of better diets against disease.2133 Polyphenols are produced by plants to protect themselves,2134 and we may be able to expropriate and commandeer them for the same purpose.2135

Plants live the ultimate sedentary lifestyle. Because they can’t move, they’ve had to evolve a whole other way to respond to threats, and they do so biochemically. They manufacture—from scratch—a dizzying array of compounds to deal with whatever’s coming their way.2136 For example, if we get too hot, we can move into the shade. But if plants get too hot, they’re stuck—they are the shade!

Plants have had nearly a billion years to create a whole chemistry set of protective substances, some of which can play a similar role in us. When plants get infected, they produce aspirin, which can come in handy when we get infected ourselves. Plants heal wounds, and so do we, using similar signaling systems.2137 Plants have DNA they need to protect from free radical damage, so they cook up complex antioxidants that we can use for ourselves instead of reinventing the wheel. In a sense, the crispers in our fridges are like nature’s medicine cabinet.

Naysayers of the power of polyphenols often point to studies showing their low bioavailability. For example, up to 85 percent of the polyphenol pigments that make blueberries blue don’t even get absorbed and end up getting dumped into our colons.2138

But that may be exactly where some of the magic happens.

Mix those blueberry polyphenols2139 with a culture of fecal bacteria, and out pops the growth of beneficial bugs like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.2140 Just as plants establish symbiotic relationships with bacteria living inside them (like the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the roots of legumes that provide built-in fertilizer), they may be able to get along with our gut flora too.

Protein, carbs, and fat are macronutrients because we eat them by the gram each day, whereas vitamins and minerals are micronutrients, as we may only get thousandths or even millionths of a gram a day. (A gram is about the weight of a raisin.) Even those eating pitifully few plants may take in as much as a full gram of polyphenols a day, though.2141 What effect might they have on our gut bacteria and body weight?


//
Boosting Bifidobacteria

Given the complexity of the human microbiome and our poor state of knowledge, researchers often restrict their focus to the effects of foods on a few familiar species that serve as a proxy for the overall balance of benefit. The bifidogenic effects of foods, for example, may be a good starting point.2142 Bifidogenic refers to foods that foster the growth of Bifidobacteria, generally recognized as beneficial bugs. Several studies have reported a relative depletion of Bifidobacteria correlating with the development of obesity2143 in both children and adults,2144 and as such, they are commonly found in commercial probiotics.

Certain prebiotics like inulin, concentrated in such vegetables as garlic and onions, can have a “huge” bifidogenic effect.2145 Ironically, inulin is a type of FODMAP, or fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols, which are actively avoided by some people with irritable bowel syndrome. Those placed on FODMAP-restricted diets do seem to end up with depleted levels of Bifidobacteria, so, in theory, such diets could actually be counterproductive for long-term gut health.2146

Polyphenols can boost Bifidobacteria growth in a test tube within a matter of hours, but can those results be replicated in the real world with polyphenol-rich foods?2147 Randomize people to about a cup of wild blueberries,2148 and you can get a significant bump in Bifidobacteria in their stools,2149 but how do you know it was due to the polyphenols and not just the fiber? Well, apples boost Bifidobacteria, too,2150 but the isolated apple fiber pectin alone does not.2151 Bananas have a similar fiber content to berries, but fewer polyphenols. Does eating bananas significantly boost Bifidobacteria? No,2152 which again suggests polyphenols may be playing a special role.

Polyphenol-rich beverages probably provide the best proof. Tea leaves and coffee beans have lots of polyphenols that end up in the brew, leaving behind the fiber. Both green tea2153 and coffee2154 are bifidogenic. For example, three cups of coffee a day can significantly raise Bifidobacteria levels in the gut within three weeks.2155 Adding milk, though, may block some of the benefits. Proteins from dairy, as well as eggs, bind to the polyphenols in coffee.2156 Soy protein does, too, but unlike milk proteins, your gut flora apparently can strip away the polyphenols from the plant protein in the gut to release them.2157

So does eating polyphenol-rich foods lead to weight loss? The Harvard studies, following more than one hundred thousand professional men and women, and their diets, for decades, found that those who choose high-polyphenol fruits and vegetables, such as apples, pears, berries, and peppers, gained significantly less weight. This association appeared to be independent of other diet and lifestyle factors, such as total daily fiber intake.2158 Polyphenols could be another reason to help explain why people randomized to eat three apples or pears a day lose more weight.


****************************************************************************************************
Do Probiotic Supplements Work?

If Bifidobacteria are so good, why not just take them in a probiotic pill? Probiotic supplements have been shown to be effective in randomized placebo-controlled trials for conditions such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea,2160 but what about weight loss? Can’t hurt, right? Well, a study published out of the Netherlands has raised concerns about probiotic safety.2161

Acute pancreatitis is on the rise and can become life-threatening in some cases. This sudden inflammation of the pancreas allows bacteria to break through our gut walls and infect our internal organs.2162 Antibiotics don’t seem to prevent this complication, but how about probiotics? They seem to work on rats. If you cause inflammation by mechanically damaging the pancreas, not only may probiotics show “strong evidence for efficacy,” but there were “no indications [of] harmful effects.”2163 But that was with rats—what about us? Clinical researchers decided to put it to the test.

Half of a group of pancreatitis patients were given probiotic pills, while the other half got sugar pills. Within ten days, the mortality rates in the probiotics group shot up compared to placebo. More than twice as many people died on the probiotics. Thus, the researchers concluded, probiotics “can no longer be considered to be harmless.” The researchers were criticized for not cautioning patients about the risk before they signed up for the study.2164 (The study subjects were told probiotics had what the researchers described as “a long history of [safe] use” with no known side effects.2165) In response to the criticisms, the researchers replied that there were no known side effects—until their study.2166

Risks for healthy individuals are likely to be rare,2167 but probiotics still may not work as intended. Animal agribusiness doesn’t only fatten farm animals with antibiotics but probiotics as well.2168 A compilation of studies found that human probiotics like Lactobacillus acidophilus, for example, commonly found in fermented dairy products, may cause significant weight gain2169 in piglets2170 and persons.2171

What about probiotics in general? Probiotic supplements are a multibillion-dollar industry, which raises concerns about conflicts of interest and “publication bias” in the scientific literature.2172 We know that Big Pharma is infamous for this; industry-funded studies that yield negative results are quietly shelved and buried, so all your doctors get to read are the glowing reports. In making evidence-based decisions for our patients, the peer-reviewed medical literature is the gold standard, but all too often, those with the gold make the standards.2173

An investigation into bias in the probiotics literature uncovered that conflicts of interest were commonly not reported, even when the authors were sponsored directly by a yogurt company, for example, and as many as twenty unflattering studies appear to have been hidden from public view.2174

Still, put all the studies on treating obesity with probiotics together, and overall, a small loss in body weight was found—though there was no significant loss of body fat, which is what we really care about when it comes to weight loss.2175 That small loss in body weight was on average, though, and there are endless variations of probiotic bacterial combinations and dosing, so it’s difficult to make sweeping generalizations. However, even some of the most successful trials appear to show only modest benefit, such as a two-pound weight loss over a three-month period.

Probiotics Bearing Fruit
Is it better to get probiotics the way nature intended? If you’ve ever made sauerkraut at home, you know you don’t have to add starter bacteria to get the cabbage to ferment. Why? Because the cabbage leaves acquire lactic acid–producing bacteria while growing out in the fields. This suggests raw fruits and vegetables may not only be a source of prebiotics—that is, fiber—but also a source of probiotics.2177 Some may even help us reap the rewards. There are bacteria on cruciferous vegetables, for example, that express that magical enzyme myrosinase I talked about in How Not to Die. So by eating broccoli-family vegetables, for instance, you may be lining your gut with the very microbes necessary to maximize their benefits.2178

While working on characterizing these bacterial communities on plants, researchers found that populations on each produce type were significantly distinct from one another. The tree fruits harbored different bacteria from vegetables on the ground, for example, and grapes and mushrooms seemed to be off in their own little worlds. So if indeed these bugs turn out to be good for us, that discovery would underscore the importance of eating not just a greater quantity but also a greater variety of fruits and vegetables every day. The researchers also found that there were significant differences in the microbiomes of conventional versus organic produce, though we don’t yet know enough about these bugs to understand any potential health implications.2179

Note that it’s still important to wash and scrub your fruits and veggies under running water to cut down on food-poisoning bacteria. Don’t worry, you’re not going to eliminate all the potentially good microbes, since many actually live inside the plant tissues and couldn’t be washed off even if you tried.2180 Because microbes and fresh produce are inseparable, cancer centers used to put patients undergoing chemotherapy on neutropenic diets devoid of uncooked fruits and vegetables for fear of foodborne infections in their immunocompromised states. When actually put to the test, though, none of the randomized controlled trials showed a benefit to restricting fresh produce,2181 and one study even found evidence of a higher rate of infections.2182 The researchers speculated that the produce was protective because the friendly flora from fruits and vegetables may have successfully crowded out any bad bugs in the gut.

The Tao of Poo
Given our limited understanding of which bugs are best, combined with the lack of regulatory oversight and quality control in the supplement industry,2183 wouldn’t it make more sense to reestablish good gut flora with actual gut flora? If our microbiome is an organ, what about an organ transplant?

During World War II, soldiers in Africa were recommended by Bedouins to treat dysentery with “consumption of fresh, warm camel feces,” but wouldn’t healthy human dung work better?2184 Remarkably, this concept dates back to the fourth century, when patients with severe diarrhea in China were treated with various preparations of fecal matter, euphemistically presented as “yellow soup” or “golden syrup.”2185 Incidentally, this came from the same medical text that described wormwood as an effective herb against malaria,2186 a discovery that led to a Nobel Prize in Medicine 1,700 years later in 2015.2187

What do we know about fecal transplants? Such research could not only offer the potential to treat disease, it could cement the cause-and-effect relationship between our microbiomes and our health.2188 The first fecal transplant trials were for a potentially life-threatening overgrowth of a hospital-acquired pathogen called Clostridium difficile. Prior to the advent of centralized stool banks, patients would have to seek “donations” from friends or relatives.2189 (It’s like what one fly said to the other: “Is this stool taken?”)

Once the “logistical challenges of delivering fresh treatment preparations”2190 were overcome, the specimens were homogenized using a “dedicated” blender and then infused from the bottom up with an enema or top down through a nasogastric tube (a hose through the nose).2191 No turkey basters necessary. More recently, capsules have been developed, but a single dose requires swallowing up to forty large capsules. Definitely not the time to suffer from reflux!

For Clostridium difficile infection, fecal transplantation can be a lifesaver. After thousands of successful transplants, it has been proven to be the single most effective therapy for recurrent infection,2192 with symptom resolution seen in 85 percent of cases.2193 (Want to learn more about how you can “Save Lives. Earn Money. Donate Your Stool” to a nonprofit stool bank? Visit www.givepoop.org.)

Doctors who want to try fecal transplants for other conditions must first acquire a special FDA permit.2194 This is due largely to theoretical concerns about disease transfer. (No such cases have yet been reported.2195) A case report published in 2015 called “Weight Gain After Fecal Microbiota Transplantation” definitely raised the stakes, though, for both the potential risks and benefits of the procedure.

A thirty-two-year-old woman “had always been of normal weight” until she received a fecal transplant from a healthy but overweight donor (her daughter).2196 This was in the United States, so by “normal,” they mean the patient was actually slightly overweight herself with a BMI of 26. After the transplant, however, she gained more than forty pounds, ballooning to obesity at a BMI of 34.5. “She said she felt like there was a switch inside her body,” her gastroenterologist reported.2197 “No matter how much she ate or exercised, she couldn’t take the weight off … she’s very frustrated.” The fecal transplant researchers concluded: “We recommend selecting non-overweight donors.”2198

The same thing happens in mice. Giving mice fecal pellets from an obese mouse resulted in a near doubling in fat mass compared to lean mouse pellets, despite eating the same number of calories.2199 This proves gut flora can play a pivotal role in obesity … in mice. What about in people?


//
Taking a Crack at Weight Loss

Researchers decided to study pairs of human twins “discordant” for obesity, meaning one twin was fat and the other was skinny. What would happen if you switched their microbiomes? The siblings may have been squeamish, so the researchers reverted again to mice. Mice fed stool from the obese twin rapidly swelled in size, but not those fed from the lean twin, despite comparable caloric intakes. Cohousing the mice together prevented the weight gain, however. The lean-type bacteria jumped over to rescue the mouse fed stool from the obese twin, but only in the context of a healthier diet—that is, the microbial cure only worked when the mice were fed diets low in saturated fat and high in fiber, which makes sense since the lean-type bacteria appeared to be fiber-munching, short-chain fatty-acid producers. “Together,” the researchers concluded, “these results … illustrate how a diet high in saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables can select against human gut bacteria … associated with leanness.”2200

The results of the twin study suggest that the role of our gut flora in obesity is simply to help take fuller advantage of a more healthful diet. So if the twins had actually swapped their stools, the obese twins might have only lost weight if they had combined the microbial makeover with healthier eating to aid the colonization of the better bugs.2201 With the new bacteria on board, though, the healthier diet could have resulted in more weight loss, even while eating the same number of calories. But you don’t really know until you put it to the test.

If you were surprised by the case report of the mother–daughter fecal transplant, there are even stranger accounts coming out of that world. One gastroenterologist, for example, described a man with alopecia (baldness) who started growing hair after getting a stool transplant.2202 You can’t know if these anecdotes are just one-offs without subjecting them to rigorous randomized controlled trials. Currently, just such a study is under way at Harvard: Stools from lean individuals are being transplanted into obese individuals to see if they suddenly start to lose more weight.2203 Stay tuned.

There was one study in which gut flora were transferred from lean to obese folks to see if their metabolic states would improve.2204 The researchers wanted it to be a placebo-controlled study. For drug trials, that’s easy: Just give a sugar pill. When you’re sticking a tube down someone’s throat and transplanting feces, though, what do you use as a “poo-cebo”? Both the lean donors and the obese subjects brought in fresh stools, and the obese subjects were randomized to get transplanted with either the donor stool or their own collected feces. That was the placebo—you get your own back! Isn’t that brilliant?

The insulin sensitivity of the skinny donors was up around 50 µmol/kg/min. That’s a good thing, because high insulin sensitivity means their insulin resistance, the cause of type 2 diabetes and a potential risk factor for worsening obesity, is low. The obese subjects started out down around 20 µmol/kg/min. After an infusion of their own feces, they stayed at around 20 as you’d expect. However, the insulin sensitivity of the group of obese subjects who got the skinny transplant shot up to near where the slimmer folks were.2205 Eureka! Finally, proof in the power of poop.

Some lean-donor stools delivered more benefit than others. It turns out this “super-donor effect” is most likely conveyed, once again, by the numbers of short-chain fatty acid–producing fiber-feeders.2206 Within a few months, however, the bacterial composition returned back to baseline, so the effects on the obese subjects were only temporary.2207 You can get similar benefits by just feeding what few good gut bacteria you may already have. In my NutritionFacts.org video on the subject, we have an animation to illustrate this concept using a bunny analogy:

Imagine you have a shed full of rabbits. If you just fed them pork rinds, they would all die. Of course, you can always repopulate the hutch by infusing new bunnies, but if you keep feeding them pork rinds, they’ll eventually die off too. That’s like taking probiotics or getting a fecal transplant without changing your diet. On the other hand, even if you start off with just a few bunnies, if you feed them what they’re meant to eat, they’ll grow and multiply on their own.

Stool transplants and probiotics may only be temporary fixes if we keep putting the wrong fuel into our gut. If we don’t change our diets, it may be a waste of money to go shopping for vegan poop on the black market (brown market?). On the other hand, by eating foods rich in prebiotics, in other words, increasing “whole plant food consumption,” we may select for and foster the growth of our own good bacteria.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

What we eat can change the composition of our gut flora—for good or for ill—within twenty-four hours. The most important thing we can do to foster the growth of good gut bacteria is keep them well fed with their favorite foods—the fiber and resistant starch concentrated in whole grains and legumes. Here, I talk about my daily morning BROL bowl, a prebiotic blend you can add to soup, eat as a sweet or savory porridge, or use in all manner of culinary creations. The road to health is paved with good intestines!

On the Juice
Issues have been raised about both the quality and quantity of vegetables prescribed and/or provided in studies. On average, the difference between the “high” and low fruit-and-vegetable groups in studies ended up only being about one and a half servings a day.2230 Beyond the problem of inadequate “dosing,” sometimes the interventions involved processed fruit and vegetable products containing added fat and sugar.2231 For example, one study in which the added-fruit-and-veggie group actually gained weight counted french fries and fruit juice toward their daily intake goals.2232 Even nonfried potatoes, like mashed, and other starchy vegetables may not have the same weight-reducing potential as nonstarchy veggies,2233 and fruit juice can carry the same sugar load as soda2234 and the same amount of fiber: zero. Even “high pulp,” “extra pulp,” and “most pulp” orange juices are not significant sources of fiber. It’s all pulp fiction.

Just as population studies have found that greater whole fruit consumption is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes yet more fruit juice consumption is linked to higher risk,2235 consuming whole fruits can facilitate weight loss, while drinking fruit juice may promote weight gain.2236 Even children given 100 percent fruit juice as toddlers tend to be at higher risk of becoming overweight.2237 This could be in part because juice may be a “gateway drink” to soda consumption.2238 Either way, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Association, and the Institute of Medicine have all recommended that fruit juice be restricted, encouraging whole fruit consumption instead.2239

How can 100 percent fruit juice be fattening but, at the same time, whole fruit slimming? It’s apparently not just the fiber. Liquid calories in general may be less satiating. If you feed people four hundred calories of fruit juice, they go on to eat 75 percent more of a test meal of mac ’n cheese than if you had instead fed them four hundred calories of whole fruit, even if the equivalent amount of fiber had been stirred into the juice.2240

Could it be because you can down juice in no time, but it takes a while to actually chew through the fruit? That extra time might give your appetite control mechanisms more of a chance to kick in. Researchers put that exact question to the test by measuring satiety after subjects slowly sipped a pound of apple juice in the same time it would take to eat a pound of apples (which is 17.2 minutes, it turns out). Even with the rate of consumption equalized, the apples, not just their juice, were more satiating.2241

Some fruit juices, however, don’t seem to cause the same weight gain. Why? To understand that, you need to understand why the body handles the sugar in fruit differently from that of corn syrup and table sugar.

****************************************************************************************************
Breaking Down the Walls
How can adding fruits and vegetables to our diets result in weight loss? The obvious answer is that they would displace other foods. Since produce tends to furnish so few calories, swapping in fruits and vegetables for the same weight or volume of most anything else would lower caloric intake. However, some studies have shown weight loss with more fruits and veggies even with no change in overall calories.2242 How do we explain that?

In foods, there are intracellular calories and extracellular calories—in other words, calories that are confined inside cells and calories that are free to be absorbed directly. Processed plant foods like fruit juice, refined grains, and sugar are letting it all hang out, and their calories are free for the taking. In contrast, all the calories in whole plant foods are not only trapped inside cells—they’re also trapped inside cell walls. Animal cells are encased only in easily digestible membranes, which allow the enzymes in our gut to effortlessly liberate the calories within a steak, for example. Plant cells, on the other hand, have walls that are made out of indigestible fiber.

Our bodies do their best to chew through those walls—literally—to get to all the goodness inside, but in the end, it’s not about what we eat but what we absorb. The way you measure how many calories a food has is to burn it and see how much energy it releases. When it comes to whole plant foods, the combustible calories significantly exceed the metabolizable calories—that is, the calories that actually make it into your bloodstream.2243 So, by eating extra fruits and vegetables, on paper, it looks like you’re taking in more calories, but when researchers have actually put it to the test and taken careful measurements, they’ve found that you can actually end up with fewer calories in your system.2244

Vegetables may offer the additional advantage of changing the expression of the genes that control our metabolisms. Greens can affect your genes. If you take biopsies of fat from people before and after a few weeks of feeding them extra vegetables, the expression of hundreds of genes is ramped up or down. By correlating those changes to the same ones you get losing weight through caloric restriction, you can uncover the weight-loss pathways and processes that appear affected by the bump in veggie intake.2245 Give people on a weight-loss diet one to two cups of vegetable juice (low-sodium V8), for example, and they lose more weight than those given none.2246 Vegetables tend to contain less sugar than fruit, though.

****************************************************************************************************
What About All the Sugar in Fruit?

Fruit’s influence on obesity has been called a “paradoxical effect” thanks to its sugar content.2247 Fruit contains sugars such as fructose, which is also found in table sugar and corn syrup. If sugar is bad for us, how is fruit so good for us?

If you directly compare the effects of a diet restricting fructose from both added sugars and fruit to one that only restricts fructose from added sugars, the diet that kept the fruit did better.2248 People lost more weight with the extra fruit present in the diet than when all fructose was restricted across the board.

Is it just the dose? To get the average intake of added sugars in the American diet2249 in fruit form, you’d have to eat about six and a half cups of apple slices a day2250 or nearly eight cups of watermelon.2251 Even if you did, though, it wouldn’t have the same effect as getting that same amount of sugar from processed sources. As the Harvard Health Letter put it, the problems associated with fructose and sugar in general “come when they are added to foods.” Fruit, on the other hand, is not just harmless but described as “beneficial in almost any amount.”2252 Almost any amount? Can we eat ten servings of fruit a day? How about twenty? That’s actually been put to the test.

Seventeen people were made to eat twenty servings of fruit a day for up to six months. Despite their extraordinarily high fructose intakes—presumably the equivalent of drinking about eight cans of soda a day—the investigators found the subjects actually lost weight and their blood pressures improved,2253 insulin levels dropped, and cholesterol and triglycerides got better.2254 This is the opposite of what one might expect eating the same amount of fructose in added sugars. Why do our bodies handle the sugars in fruit differently from the sugars added to foods and beverages?

If you drink a glass of water with three tablespoons of table sugar mixed in, which is like a can of soda, you get a big spike in blood sugar within the first hour. Your body freaks out and releases so much insulin you actually overshoot the mark such that, by the second hour, you end up relatively hypoglycemic, dropping your blood sugar below where it was even before you had consumed anything. In response, your body dumps fat into your bloodstream, which can have a variety of adverse effects, such as increasing insulin resistance.2255 That’s one of the reasons we shouldn’t be drinking soda, aka liquid candy. But what if you added nature’s candy—berries?

What if you eat blended berries in addition to the sugar? What would happen if you were to repeat the same experiment but add nearly an additional tablespoon of sugar—this time in fruit form, the way nature intended, rather than table sugar? Still, downing four tablespoons of sugar instead of three should cause an even bigger blood sugar spike, right? Not only did that not happen, there was no hypoglycemic dip afterward. Blood sugar simply went up and down without that overshoot and without the surge of fat into the blood.2256

Initially, the researchers attributed the difference in response to the thickening effects of the berries, as the soluble fiber in the berries would presumably have a gelling effect. Compared with just guzzling straight sugar water, the berry addition might slow both the rate of stomach emptying and the release of sugars in our intestines. To test to see if it was the fiber, researchers repeated the experiment with berry juice, which had nearly all the sugar but none of the fiber. A clear difference was observed early on in the blood sugar response. At the fifteen-minute mark, the blood sugar spike was significantly reduced by the blended berries, but not by the berry juice, although the rest of the beneficial responses were almost the same between the whole fruit and juice, suggesting there’s more at play than just the fiber.

Just Beet It
Fiber content isn’t the only difference between table sugar and the source of most table sugar these days, sugar beets.2258 There are also the thousands of phytonutrients that are stripped away in the sugar-refining process. It turns out some of the polyphenols in fruit can block the transport of sugars through the intestinal lining, slowing absorption.2259 In fact, adding fruit can actually blunt the insulin spike from high-glycemic foods. For example, white bread creates a big insulin spike an hour after eating it. Eat that same white bread with some berries, though, and even though you just effectively added more sugar, you’re able to blunt the spike, because the sugar was in fruit form.2260 So if you’re going to make pancakes or muffins, make them blueberry.

We can finally explain why some juices are better than others. Cloudy apple juice has more polyphenols, which may help explain why whole apples lower cholesterol compared to clear apple juice but not compared to cloudy apple juice.2261 Have people drink cups of cloudy apple juice every day, and they lose body fat compared to a polyphenol-free control beverage with the same number of calories.2262 Similar results were found for Concord (purple) grape juice. Have people drink two cups of a grape-flavored drink like Kool-Aid every day for a few months, and they gain a few pounds, but not when the same number of calories were added in the form of grape juice. Sorry, Welch’s (the study’s funder), but whole grapes would have probably done even better.

Free the Fruit

In a study entitled “Not Enough Fruit and Vegetables or Too Many Cookies, Candies, Salty Snacks, and Soft Drinks?” public health researchers suggested fruit and vegetable promotion campaigns were distractions from the larger problem of excess junk.2264 Many urban populations may suffer less from “food deserts,” where corner stores lack fresh produce, than from “food swamps.”2265 “It may be politically more expedient to promote an increase in consumption of healthy items rather than a decrease in consumption of unhealthy items,” they concluded, “but it may be far less effective.”2266

To find out which approach worked better, a group of overweight women were randomized to one of two dietary approaches: Avoid high-fat foods or eat more fruits and vegetables. The advice was bolstered with group and individual sessions with a dietitian to try to keep the respective groups on track. Though the group just given the positive messaging to eat more fruits and vegetables lost weight over a period of six months, the restrictive-messaging group lost significantly more.2267 Win-win, but obviously not either-or.

We don’t have to choose between adding fruits and veggies or subtracting fattening foods. All the strategies in this book aim to complement each other.

Given the myriad benefits, how can we get more people to eat more fruits and vegetables? Well, we could make them free. Offering free fruits and veggies in a cafeteria setting nearly quintupled the likelihood of people reaching their daily recommended intakes.2268 Does this translate into weight loss? A study in Norway tested out a free fruit program among schoolchildren. Compared to control schools, a year of free fruit for ten- to twelve-year-olds resulted in a 40 percent lower prevalence of being overweight seven years later.2269

Concerns have been raised, however, that by subsidizing healthy food, people might just have more money to spend on junk.2270 To test this, a small group of low-income, overweight individuals were provided supermarket gift cards worth forty dollars each month. Half were randomized to cards that could buy any food at the grocery store, and the other half to cards good only for fruits and vegetables. After three months, the buy-anything group gained weight, whereas the subsidized-fruit-and-veggie group lost weight, ending up nearly ten pounds lighter than the control group.2271 Unfortunately, this study appears to be the exception.

A recent study in Toronto found that providing free produce boosted fruit and vegetable intake about 50 percent more than just advising people to eat more of them. Even then, however, the free-fruit-and-veg group only ended up consuming about a total of three servings a day and, not surprisingly, lost no more weight after six months than the control group.2272 The recommended minimum number of daily servings of fruits and vegetables a day is seven to thirteen, but most Americans don’t even get five.2273 After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention realized that even a recommendation of five daily servings seemed “unachievable,” it changed the National Cancer Institute’s “5 A Day Program” to “Fruits & Veggies—More Matters.” (It also considered the slogan “Appetite for Life” to emphasize how our food choices are truly life or death, but such messaging was thought perhaps too “rational,” needing a “stronger emotional appeal.”2274)

Ideally, on a population scale, fruits and vegetables should be better promoted. The National Fruit & Vegetable Alliance gave failing grades to the federal government for inadequate produce marketing and nutrition education,2275 and the private sector may be even worse. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission subpoenaed dozens of food, beverage, and restaurant companies to release information about their marketing expenditures that focus on children and adolescents.2276 The findings? Fruit and vegetable promotion constitutes less than half a penny of each dollar spent.

Garlic Press
In the Harvard cohorts, the categories of berries and apples/pears appeared to stand out on the fruit side in terms of foods associated with the most weight loss, and cauliflower and tofu/soy did so on the vegetable side.2278 As I’ve noted, apples and pears were put to the test in a randomized controlled trial and shown to produce weight loss even compared to same-calorie controls.2279 Have there been any similar such studies on other fruits and vegetables?

Garlic can reduce the body fat of rats2280 and mice2281 even at the same caloric intakes (so it wasn’t because they didn’t like the taste), but rodent studies found the same for tomatoes,2282 and that didn’t seem to necessarily translate to people.2283 There was a study in which a few cloves of crushed raw garlic a day appeared to have a waist-slimming effect, but without a control group, you don’t know if the subjects may have just lost the weight because they were under observation.2284 Garlic is so potent, though. What if you stuffed it into a pill and designed not just a randomized controlled study but one that’s double-blind with a placebo by giving people coated tablets containing garlic powder versus sugar pills?

One such study tried giving people with metabolic syndrome placebo or actual garlic tablets adding up to a half teaspoon of garlic powder a day. And it worked, resulting in a drop in both weight and waistlines within six weeks.2285 A half teaspoon of garlic powder costs less than four cents. What about trying garlic supplements, like the fancy aged garlic extract ones you may have seen advertised. No weight-loss benefits were found.2286,2287

How about just a quarter teaspoon of garlic powder a day? About one hundred overweight men and women were randomized to two 400 mg garlic powder tablets a day or placebo, and those unknowingly taking the two cents’ worth of daily garlic powder lost nearly six pounds of straight body fat over the next fifteen weeks.2288 The only caveat (besides possible decreased kissability) is that garlic can have blood-thinning effects, so it should be stopped a week before elective surgery.2289 It may also overly detoxify and interfere with the efficacy of an HIV drug known as saquinavir (sold as Invirase or Fortovase).

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Does it matter when you eat your fruits and vegetables? In my Negative Calorie Preloading section that’s coming up in part IV, I explore the benefits of making them the first choice for your first course. There’s even a public health campaign in Japan called “Eat Vegetables First at Meals.”2291 Just changing the order of foods you eat can have meaningful metabolic impact. Compared to the exact same meal eaten in a different order, eating vegetables first can decrease blood sugar and insulin excursions in diabetics2292 and prediabetics,2293 resulting in significantly better blood sugar control over the long term.2294 However, this may be due in part to the fact that those randomized to receive advice to eat vegetables first ended up eating more vegetables overall.2295 This may also help explain why children who eat vegetables first during a meal may have less than 50 percent of the odds of being overweight compared to those who ate meat/fish first.2296 So the best time to eat them may in fact be anytime you can.

Just as keeping candy out of plain view can help keep junk out of sight, out of stomach,2297 increasing the visibility and accessibility of healthy snacks may help. Those randomized to keep a bowl of fruit on the kitchen counter instead of inside the fridge ended up closer to meeting their daily needs.2298 What about vegetables? Serving greater quantities of veggies was found to significantly increase vegetable intake by preschool children,2299 as well as adults.2300 One of the “Top Ten Tips for Weight Loss” used in the studies I discuss here is “Do not heap food on your plate (except vegetables).”2301

For the most delicious produce, explore local farmers’ markets, community-supported agriculture, and pick-your-own orchards, or garden yourself. Fruits and vegetables today are bred to survive long-distance shipping, not necessarily to taste their best.2302 Even heritage breeds can lose flavor after traveling eight thousand miles from New Zealand. Did you know the “fresh” apple you buy at the grocery store may be ten months old?2303 It’s wonderful that we can get produce year-round, thanks to new storage technologies, but if you’ve never eaten an apple picked straight off a tree, you are missing out.

My favorite fruit in the whole world can’t even be sold commercially because it’s too fragile. Have you ever had a pawpaw, North America’s largest native fruit? Think luscious tropical banana-mango custard. For a few weeks in September across the Midwest and mid-Atlantic, you can forage for them in the wild or find them at farmers’ markets (unless I get there first). See you at the next pawpaw festival!

RICH IN LEGUMES

The Hispanic Paradox
According to a national dietary survey, those who eat beans tend to be healthier and have less obesity risk, lower body weight, and smaller waist sizes.2304 This finding has been used to explain what’s known as the Hispanic paradox: Despite higher poverty rates and disparities in health care and education,2305 Hispanic Americans tend to live longer than everyone else.2306 Hispanics have a 24 percent lower risk of premature death, thanks to lower risks of nine of the fifteen leading causes of death, including notably less cancer and heart disease.2307

What’s powerful enough to overcome lower socioeconomic status, education level, health literacy, insurance coverage, and disproportionate employment in high-risk occupations?2308

Public health researchers suggest it may be “time to spill the beans”2309—or, more broadly, the legumes. Legumes, including beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils, can be considered “potent tools in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease.”2310

Just because people who eat beans tend to be slimmer and healthier 2311 doesn’t necessarily mean legumes deserve the credit. Each bean burrito may mean one less beef burrito. Researchers were able to show a variety of metabolic benefits randomizing people to swap out two servings of meat for legumes three days a week,2312 but is the benefit from what is being eaten or what is being replaced? In the Harvard studies, the food category most associated with weight loss over time was soy food products, with nearly ten times the weight reduction associated with vegetable consumption.2313 But how many people are eating bacon double-cheese tofu burgers? Indeed, bean consumption is associated with less saturated fat and cholesterol intake,2314 so it may just be a marker for a healthier diet in general. Nevertheless, the Harvard studies controlled for a whole array of dietary and lifestyle factors yet still found a significant link between beans and better health.

Dozens of randomized controlled trials have found that soy can lower cholesterol2315 and blood pressure,2316 but what about non-soy legumes? Compilations of more than sixty randomized controlled trials have found that other beans also lower cholesterol,2317 as well as benefit blood sugars and lower insulin levels,2318 but consumer surveys suggest most Americans are unaware of these benefits.2319 One could say they don’t know beans about beans!

****************************************************************************************************
The Lentil Effect
What about interventional studies on beans and weight control? In the famous “satiety index” study that compared the hunger-slaking power of dozens of different foods, both fiber and protein content were associated with appetite-suppressing effects.2320 This would seem to make legumes ideal candidates,2321 and indeed, we’ve known for more than thirty years that meals featuring beans can disproportionally delay the return of hunger.2322 Does this then translate into reduced caloric intake throughout the day?

What do you think happened when people were given a cup of chickpeas or the same number of calories of white bread and butter? Those who had eaten the chickpeas ate nearly two hundred fewer calories of a meal served a few hours later.2323 Navy beans may work even better than chickpeas, and lentils best of all.2324 How do legumes fare compared to something a little more substantial than Wonder Bread, though?

Researchers compared patties made with fava beans and split peas to protein-matched patties made out of meat. The title of the study gives it away: “Meals Based on Vegetable Protein Sources (Beans and Peas) Are More Satiating Than Meals Based on Animal Protein Sources (Veal and Pork).” Even lower-protein patties in which most of the mashed beans and peas were replaced with potato held their own against the meat.2325 The researchers suggested this may help explain why intake of animal protein has been associated with subsequent weight gain, but consumption of plant protein hasn’t.2326 Beans are free of the baggage inherent to animal protein sources, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, and instead offer a bonus in the form of fiber, which likely explains their satiety benefits.2327

It’s no wonder legumes are more satiating than white bread. Both fiber and water have no calories, so to get the same number of calories in bean form, you have to feed people more food. You can imagine how eating a cup of chickpeas would be more filling than eating two pieces of white bread, which you could probably squeeze into a little ball in your fist. Only a minority of studies showed bean consumption actually cut down on subsequent caloric intake at later meals, though, but that may be because the researchers simply might not have waited long enough.2328 The satiating power of legumes is thought to arise from the effects of the slowly digesting resistant starch and fiber lower down in the intestines, which may not be reflected in studies lasting fewer than three hours.

In 1982, an extraordinary discovery was published. It had already been demonstrated that beans cause an “exceptionally” low blood sugar response, half that of other common foods.2329 What was discovered was that eating legumes could benefit your metabolism hours later 2330 or even the next day. Eat lentils for dinner, and eleven hours later, your body reacts differently to breakfast.2331 Even when made to drink straight sugar water the next morning, your body is better able to handle it. At the time, the researchers dubbed it the “lentil effect,” but subsequent studies found chickpeas appear to work just as well. It has since been christened the “second meal effect.”2332

How is that even possible? Remember how we feed our gut bacteria and they feed us right back? Good gut flora can take fiber and produce valuable short-chain fatty acids that get absorbed into our bloodstreams and circulate throughout our systems. So if we eat a bean burrito for dinner, by the next morning, our gut bacteria are eating that same burrito, and the by-products they create may affect how our breakfasts are digested and how full we feel.

This second-meal effect can include changes in appetite. Eat half a can of brown beans at dinner, and you feel less hungry after breakfast the next day than had you instead eaten the same number of calories in non-bean form the night before.2333

Researchers solved the mystery of the second-meal effect by giving people rectal infusions of the number of short-chain fatty acids our good bacteria might make from a good beany burrito. The stomach responded within minutes.2334 So I guess if you forgot to eat any kind of beans for dinner and needed to blunt the effect of your breakfast donut, it’s theoretically not too late, but, in general, I encourage people to take their food by mouth.


Adding Beans vs. Portion Control

Does all this talk of legumes translate into weight loss? Let’s feed people some beans and find out. If you feed overweight and obese individuals three-quarters of a cup of canned navy beans a day for a month, they end up dropping about an inch off their waists.2335 The study had no control group, though, so we don’t know if the subjects would have slimmed down without the daily dose of beans.

As we’ve discussed, designing dietary trials can be challenging when trying to come up with a proper control. If you simply ask people to add chickpeas to their diets and then analyze their subsequent dietary changes, the single biggest change they make is to reduce their consumption of non-chickpea legumes.2336 If the subjects are just swapping out one bean for another or eating fewer vegetables to compensate, one would not expect the full benefit to materialize. This may help explain why the interventional trials on legumes for weight control have been disappointing overall, showing on average only a small effect in people randomized to add an average of one serving of legumes to their daily diets.2337

The better-designed trials yielded better results, though.2338 For example, in one study, more than one hundred participants were randomized to either increase legume intake by at least one cup per day or to instead add whole-grain foods to their diets, so both groups would be bumping up their fiber intakes with healthy foods. After three months, the whole-grain group lost a little weight, but the legume group lost significantly more, resulting in about an inch off their waists.2339

My favorite bean study was published in 2012 out of the University of Toronto. (I assume everyone has a favorite bean study?) The researchers recognized that calorie cutting is the cornerstone of most weight-loss strategies, but the majority of people who lose weight by eating smaller portions gain it back. Starving ourselves almost never works long term. Therefore, the researchers concluded, “it is important to identify foods that can be easily incorporated into the diet and spontaneously lead to the attainment and maintenance of a healthy body weight.”2340 Spontaneously is the key word there—in other words, lose weight without really trying. They figured legumes might be a good candidate, so, for the first time ever, beans were pitted head-to-head against caloric restriction.

The legume group was asked to eat about three-quarters of a cup of lentils, chickpeas, split peas, or navy beans a day, and the calorie-restriction group was tasked with cutting five hundred calories out of their daily diets. So, in effect, the bean group was asked to eat more food and the calorie-cutting group was asked to eat less. After two months, both groups slimmed about an inch off their waists.2341

Increasing diet quality appeared to work as well as decreasing diet quantity.



Starch Blockers

Eating legumes achieved weight loss even in studies meant to be weight-neutral like cholesterol- or blood sugar–lowering trials.2342 Part of the reason may be because nearly 20 percent of bean starch slips through our small intestines undigested, so beans can end up contributing fewer calories than are listed on the can’s label.2343 Some of the starch in legumes is tightly packed into double-spiraled crystals, which our digestive enzymes have trouble infiltrating, and there are also compounds in legumes that directly target our starch-munching enzymes.2344 This is where the concept of starch blocking comes from.

Crude bean extracts, commercialized as “starch blocker” supplements, have a sordid history. By the early 1980s, the American public was swallowing a million starch-blocker tablets a day for weight loss.2345 Despite a lack of human testing, hundreds of such products had flooded the market.2346 Finally, data from clinical trials started to trickle in, and the findings were universally negative, with emblematic titles such as “‘Starch Blockers’ Are Ineffective in Man”2347 or simply “Starch Blockers Do Not Block Starch Digestion.”2348 And that was the problem. Apparently, the bean compounds were not stable in pill form.2349 Starch-blocker pills were all yanked from the market in 1982 by the Food and Drug Administration.2350

Subsequently, manufacturers were able to create a more active product,2351 so, at the very least, it could be put to the test. A compilation of studies on the newer generation of starch blockers found they could reduce body fat compared to placebo.2352 Unsurprisingly, the majority of studies were funded by the manufacturers themselves. Funding bias aside, the bigger concern is the lack of industry regulation that too often calls into question the purity, safety, and label accuracy of dietary supplements.2353 So while I can’t recommend starch blockers in pill form, I can recommend them in food form. The starch-blocking capacity of whole beans survives cooking and may therefore play a role in the prevention and treatment of obesity.


What About Lectins?

In 2017, a book called The Plant Paradox was published, purporting to expose “the hidden dangers in ‘healthy’ foods that cause disease and weight gain.” The so-called dangerous, disease-causing, and weight-gaining foods included beans, whole grains, and tomatoes. What? In a rehashing of the since discredited2355 “blood type diet” from decades ago, the author accuses lectins of contributing to chronic disease. The Plant Paradox was written by an M.D., but if you’ve seen any of my medical education videos, you’ll know that’s effectively an anti-credential when it comes to writing diet books. Graduating from medical school basically advertises to the world that you’ve received likely little or no formal training in nutrition. Dr. Atkins was, after all, a cardiologist.

The thesis of the book doesn’t even seem to pass the sniff test. If lectins are bad for you, then beans would be the worst. In that case, shouldn’t bean counters find legume lovers have shortened lives? The exact opposite seems to be true: Legumes have been found to be perhaps “the most important dietary predictor of survival in older people” around the world.2356 As Dan Buettner points out in his Blue Zones longevity work, lectin-packed foods like legumes are the “cornerstones” of the diets of all the healthiest, longest-lived populations on the planet.2357

When I heard about The Plant Paradox, my first thought was, Let me guess. He sells a line of lectin-blocking supplements. And what do you know? “SHIELDING YOUR BODY FROM LECTINS” for only $79.95 a month, his website assures. That’s like $1,000 a year. But wait. There’s more. The dozens of supplements he hawks on his website could add up to nearly $20,000 a year if taken as recommended. He must be making a fortune stoking, then preying on people’s fears. Oh, did I not mention his skin care line? He’ll generously sell you a jar of his “Firm + Sculpt” cream for the low, low price of only $120—discounted if you subscribe to his “VIP Club.”

In the 1800s, a compound was discovered in castor beans, which we would come to know as the first of a class of lectin proteins—natural compounds found throughout the food supply, but concentrated in beans, whole grains, and certain fruits and vegetables.2358 Every decade or two, it seems, a question is raised as to whether dietary lectins may be causing disease. It’s easy to raise hysteria about lectins. After all, that first one, found back in 1889, went by the name ricin, which is known to be a “potent homicidal poison” used by the Kremlin to assassinate anti-Communist dissidents—or (Breaking Bad spoiler alert!) by rogue chemistry teachers.2359 Ricin is a lectin. Thankfully, however, many lectins are nontoxic, such as those found in tomatoes and other common foods,2360 and even the ones that can cause problems, like those found in raw kidney beans, are utterly destroyed by proper cooking.2361

What would happen if kidney beans were eaten raw? Because of the lectins, you would be doubled over with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within hours.2362 But how would you even eat raw kidney beans? The only way they’re sold uncooked is as dried beans, which are as hard as rocks. In the first outbreak reported in the medical literature, “an impromptu supper was made” with a bag of beans dumped in a skillet and soaked in water overnight, but never cooked.2363 You can’t even just throw them in a slow cooker. Dried kidney beans have to be boiled. According to some researchers, they should be soaked in water for at least five hours and then boiled for at least ten minutes.2364 I’m no Iron Chef, but ten minutes? Kidney beans wouldn’t be done in only ten minutes. Cooking presoaked beans for a couple of minutes can destroy the lectins, but it takes about an hour of boiling before the beans are soft enough to eat, when they’re easily flattened with a fork.2365 So the lectins would be long gone before they’re palatable.

The same goes for pressure cooking. Without presoaking, it takes forty-five minutes in a pressure cooker to get rid of all the lectins in kidney beans, but an hour to make the beans edible,2366 so, again, they’d be lectin-free before you ate them. Even twelve hours at 65°C (150°F), which is about the temperature of hot tea, won’t do it, though, but you could tell they weren’t cooked enough because they’d be firm and rubbery. Folks have, however, tried putting undercooked kidney beans in something like a “raw” vegetable salad, and people have gotten sick. There have been dozens of such incidents reported, but each could have been “easily prevented” had the beans been cooked properly2367 or if canned beans had been used instead. Canned beans are cooked beans. The canning process is a cooking process. None of the confirmed incidents was ever due to canned beans.

The purported “plant paradox” is that, on the one hand, whole, healthy plant foods are the foundations of a good diet, but on the other hand, we supposedly need to avoid lectin-containing foods since they can supposedly lead to inflammation. But feed people four servings a week of beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils, and you can get a whopping 40 percent drop in C-reactive protein,2368 a leading indicator of systemic inflammation. More beans equals less inflammation. Greater consumption of each of the major categories of whole plant foods—fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, and nuts—is associated with living significantly longer,2369 so there’s really no paradox after all.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

On any given day, only about 8 percent of Americans eat beans.2370 This may be due in part to an unfamiliarity with how to prepare and incorporate them into our diets. Some people seem intimidated by legumes, imagining overnight soakings and long cooking times, but they can be as easy to prep as a few twists of a can opener.2371 Rather cook them from scratch? Harvard’s Institute of Lifestyle Medicine recommends starting with lentils: Combine three cups of water for every one cup of lentils. Bring to a boil and then simmer for twenty minutes until soft. Drain and enjoy. I encourage you to make extra and freeze them in portions.

Split red or orange lentils are even easier. They’re ready in five minutes, quicker than boiling pasta.2372 Once they’ve softened, rinse them to cool, then mix with herbs and lemon juice for a basic legume salad. Another favorite of mine is to cook lentils a little longer so they thicken into almost a purée before adding spices like curry, turmeric, cumin, and garam masala for a thick, savory, and healthy Indian-inspired sauce.

Once you’re ready to branch out, I’d recommend an electric pressure cooker. Add dried beans and water, press one or two buttons, and beans are cooked to perfection without any presoaking necessary. The cooker even shuts itself off automatically. It couldn’t be easier or more foolproof. I used to buy canned (BPA-free, of course) beans by the case, so my electric pressure cooker easily paid for itself, given how incredibly inexpensive dried beans are. It’s not that I’m unwilling to splurge the few extra cents for canned—I just prefer the texture of home-cooked beans. I now find canned beans can be a little mushy, which is fine for making hummus, bean dips, or some soup I’ll end up blending, but if I’m eating the actual beans, I’ve become spoiled for a slightly firmer bite.

There’s a reason legumes have earned the hallowed distinction of being officially recognized in the federal dietary guidelines as belonging to both the vegetable group and the protein group. They’re loaded with protein, iron, and zinc, as you might expect from other protein sources like meat, but legumes also offer nutrients concentrated in the vegetable kingdom, such as fiber, folate, and potassium. You therefore get the best of both worlds with beans, all the while enjoying foods that are naturally low in saturated fat and sodium, and completely free of cholesterol.

Fearful of flatulence? Stop by your local library and check out the Clearing the Air About Beans and Gas section in the beans chapter in How Not to Die. The bottom line (no pun intended) is that most people either don’t experience any gastrointestinal side effects after adding beans to their diets or the symptoms dissipate within the first few weeks.

SATIATING

Built for Gluttony
The importance of satiety is underscored by a rare genetic condition known as Prader-Willi syndrome. Those born with this disease have impaired signaling between their digestive systems and their brains, so they don’t know when they’re full. With no sensation of satiety, they can accidentally eat so much they fatally rupture their stomachs. Without satiety, food could be a death sentence.2374

Protein is often described as the most satiating macronutrient.2375 People tend to report feeling fuller after eating a protein-rich meal compared to a carbohydrate- or fat-rich one. But does that feeling last? From a weight-loss standpoint, satiety ratings only matter if they end up cutting down on subsequent caloric intake,2376 and even a review funded in part by the meat, dairy, and egg industries acknowledges this does not seem to be the case for protein.2377 Hours after consumption, that protein eaten earlier doesn’t tend to end up cutting calories.

Fiber, on the other hand, contributes to suppressing hunger up to ten hours after it’s eaten2378 and can reduce subsequent meal intake.2379 Why? Its site of action is twenty feet down in the lower intestine. Remember the ileal brake from the High in Fiber-Rich Foods section? Secretly infuse nutrients into the end of the small intestine, and people spontaneously eat as many as hundreds of fewer calories at the next meal2380 because of a signal to our brains that we are full from head to tail.

We were built for gluttony. It’s a hedge against times of scarcity. Stumbling across a rare bounty, those who could stuff themselves the most to build up the greatest reserves would be most likely to pass along their genes. You might say it was the survival of the fullest. So we are hardwired to eat not just until our stomachs are full but also until our entire digestive tracts are occupied. Only when our brains sense food all the way at the end of our lower intestines may our appetites dial down fully.

Fiber-depleted foods rapidly get absorbed early on, though, so not much ever makes it down to the lower gut. Given how little fiber the average American eats, it’s no wonder we’re so hungry and always overeating: Our brains keep waiting for the food that never arrives. Indeed, this is why, even after a stomach-stapling surgery that leaves just a tiny, two tablespoons–sized stomach pouch, people can still eat enough to regain most of the weight they initially lost. Without sufficient fiber transporting nutrients all the way down our digestive tracts, we may never feel fully satiated.

Two Hundred Pounds Without Hunger

Anyone can lose weight eating less food. Anyone can be starved thin. Starvation diets are rarely sustainable, though, since hunger pangs drive us to eat. We feel unsatisfied on low-calorie diets. Unsatiated. We do have some level of voluntary control, but our deep-seated instinctual drives may win out in the end.

For example, you can consciously hold your breath. Try it right now. How long can you go before your body’s self-preservation mechanisms take over and overwhelm your deliberate intent not to breathe? Your body has your best interests at heart and is too smart to allow you to suffocate yourself—or starve yourself, for that matter. But if our bodies were really that smart, how could they let us become obese? Why don’t our bodies realize when we’re too fat and allow us the leeway to slim down? Could it be that our bodies are actually aware—and actively trying to help—but we’re somehow undermining those efforts? How could we test this theory to see if that’s true?

So many variables go into choosing what and how much we eat. There are psychological, social, cultural, aesthetic, and other factors. To strip away all of that and stick just to the physiological, Columbia University researchers designed a series of famous experiments using a “food dispensing device.”2382 The term food is used very loosely here. Their feeding machine was a tube hooked up to a pump that delivered a mouthful of bland liquid formula every time a button was pushed. Research subjects were instructed to eat as much or as little as they wanted at any time. In this way, eating was reduced to just the rudimentary hunger drive. Without the usual trappings of sociability, meal ceremony, and the pleasures of the palate, how much would people be driven to eat?

Put a normal-weight person in this scenario, and something remarkable happens. Day after day, week after week, with nothing more than their hunger to guide them, they ate exactly as much as they needed, perfectly maintaining their weights. They required about three thousand calories a day, and that’s just how much they gave themselves. Their bodies just intuitively seemed to know how many times to press that button to get food.2383

What happened when obese people were put in a similar scenario? Driven by hunger alone with the enjoyment of eating stripped away, they wildly undershot and gave themselves as little as 145 calories a day. Fewer than 200 total calories for the entire day! The obese subjects could eat as much as they wanted, but they just weren’t hungry. It’s as if their bodies knew how grossly overweight they were and so dialed down their natural hunger drives to almost nothing. One research subject started out at four hundred pounds and steadily lost weight. After 252 days, even after switching to drinking the “food” out of a cup at home, he lost two hundred pounds.2384

Initially, this groundbreaking discovery was interpreted by some to mean that obesity is not caused by some sort of metabolic disturbance that drives people to overeat. Instead, overeating appeared to be a function of the meaning people attached to food beyond its use as fuel, whether as a source of pleasure or perhaps relief from boredom or stress.2385 Obesity, then, seemed more psychological than physical. However, subsequent experiments with the feeding machine suggest quite the opposite.2386

If you take a lean study subject and covertly double the calorie concentration of the formula, they unconsciously cut their consumption in half to continue to perfectly maintain their weights. Their bodies somehow detected the change in calorie load and sent signals to their brains to press the button half as often to compensate. Do the same thing with obese persons, and nothing changes. They continue to undereat just as much as before. Their bodies appeared incapable of detecting or reacting to the change in calorie load, suggesting a physiological inability to regulate intake.2387

Could the brains of obese people somehow be insensitive to internal satiety signals? We don’t know if it’s cause or effect—that is, maybe that’s why they’re obese in the first place, or maybe the body knows how obese it is and is shutting down the hunger drive regardless of the calorie concentration. Indeed, the obese subjects continued to steadily lose weight eating out of the machine regardless of the calorie concentration. It would be interesting to see if they regained the ability to respond to changing caloric intake once they reached their ideal weights. Either way, what can we take from these studies to facilitate weight loss out in the real world?

The Spice of Life

How did we evolve to solve the daunting task of selecting a diet that supplies all the essential nutrients? Dietary diversity. By eating a variety of foods, we increase our chances of hitting all the bases. If we ate solely for pleasure, we might just stick with our favorite foods to the exclusion of all others. Thankfully, we have an innate tendency to switch things up.

For example, we end up eating more calories when provided with three different yogurt flavors than just one, even if that one and only one is our chosen favorite.2390 So variation can trump sensation. This appears to be something we’re born with. Studies on newly weaned infants dating back nearly a century show that babies naturally choose a variety of foods even over their one preferred food.2391 This tendency seems to be driven by a phenomenon called sensory-specific satiety.2392

Within minutes, the pleasantness of the taste, smell, texture, and appearance of an eaten food drops off compared to the uneaten foods.2393 It’s like how the first bite of chocolate tastes better than the tenth bite. Our bodies tire of the same sensations and seek out novelty by rekindling our appetites every time we’re presented with new foods. This helps explain the “dessert effect,” where we can be stuffed to the gills but get a second wind when dessert arrives.2394

What was adaptive for our ancient ancestors to maintain nutritional adequacy, however, may be maladaptive in the age of overabundance and obesity.

Feed people a four-course meal, and they eat 60 percent more calories than when presented with the same dish served at each of the four courses.2395 It’s not just due to boredom. Our bodies have different physiological reactions. Give people a squirt of lemon juice, and their salivary glands respond with a squirt of saliva. But give someone a squirt of lemon juice ten times in a row, and they salivate less and less each time. What happens if you switch to lime juice? Their salivation jumps right back up.2396 We’re hardwired to respond differently to new foods.

On the same plate,2397 at the same meal,2398 or even on subsequent days,2399 the greater the variety, the more we tend to eat. Give overweight kids the same mac ’n cheese dinner five days in a row, and they end up eating hundreds of fewer calories by the fifth day compared to kids who got a variety of different meals each day.2400 Even just switching the shape of food can lead to overeating. Give kids the same mac ’n cheese but change the elbow macaroni to spiral noodles, and they end up eating significantly more of the new pasta shape.2401 Even perceived variety may get people to eat more. Give people a bowl filled with ten different colors of M&M’s, and even though all the colors taste the same, people reportedly eat 43 percent more than if there were only seven colors of the candies offered.2402 The greater the difference, the greater the effect. Alternating between sweet and savory foods can have a particularly appetite-stimulating effect. In this way, adding a diet soda to a fast-food meal can lead to overconsumption.

The staggering array of modern food choices may be one of the factors conspiring to undermine our appetite control.2403 There are now tens of thousands of different foods being sold.2404 In fact, the wide variety available at our groceries is one of the most successful ways to make rats fat. When researchers first tried to make rats fat in a lab, it didn’t work. The richer the rat chow, the less the rats ate to maintain their weights. Attempt after attempt failed. “We therefore used a more extreme diet,” the researchers recalled. “We fed rats an assortment of palatable foods purchased at a nearby supermarket (e.g., cookies, cheese, marshmallows, chocolate.)” And what do you know? On what became known as the supermarket diet (and later the cafeteria diet), the animals rapidly gained weight.2405

It’s kind of like the opposite of the original food-dispensing device. Instead of the all-you-can-eat bland liquid, researchers offered free all-you-can-eat access to elaborate vending machines stocked with forty trays with a dizzying array of beverages and foods like pastries and french fries. Participants seemed to find it impossible to maintain energy balance, consuming an average of 127 percent of their calorie requirements.2406

Our understanding of sensory-specific satiety can be used to get people to gain weight, but how can we use it to our advantage? For example, would limiting the variety of unhealthy snacks help people lose weight? Two randomized controlled trials attempted, yet failed, to show significantly more weight loss in the reduced variety groups, but they also failed to get people to make much of a dent in their diets at all. Just cutting down on a few snack types seems insufficient to make much of a difference.2407,2408 A more drastic change may be needed.

Meatball Monotony and Veggie Variety

Sensory-specific satiety may be one of the reasons meal replacements and fad “mono diets” like the cabbage soup diet and the oatmeal diet can result in better adherence and lower ratings of hunger compared to less restrictive diets.2409

An all-potato diet would probably take the (Yukon) gold for blandest and most monotonous and satiating. In fact, in “A Satiety Index of Common Foods,” the landmark study I mentioned in the Rich in Legumes section in which dozens of foods were put to the test, the most satiating food researchers found was the boiled potato.2410 Two hundred and forty calories of boiled potatoes were found to be more satisfying in terms of quelling hunger than the same number of calories of any other food they tested. No other food even came close.

No doubt the low calorie density played a role. To feed people 240 calories of potatoes, they had to feed them nearly a pound of spuds, compared to just a few cookies, but that’s kind of the point. They did have to feed people even more apples, grapes, and oranges, though, yet each of those fruits was still about 40 percent less satiating than the potatoes.2411

The mono diet is the poster child for unsustainability—and thank heavens for that. Over time, eating just one thing day after day can lead to serious nutrient deficiencies—like blindness from vitamin A deficiency in the case of white potatoes.2412 The satiating power of potatoes can still be brought to bear, though. Boiled potatoes beat out pasta and rice in terms of a satiating side dish, cutting as much as about two hundred calories of intake off a meal.2413 Fried potatoes or even baked fries, however, do not appear to have the same satiating effect.2414

To exploit sensory-specific satiety for weight loss while maintaining nutrient abundance, you could limit the variety of unhealthy foods you eat, while expanding the variety of healthy foods.2415 In that way, you can simultaneously take advantage of the appetite-suppressing effects of monotony, while diversifying your fruit-and-vegetable portfolio. Studies have shown that a greater variety of calorie-dense foods like sweets and snacks is associated with excess body fat, but a greater variety of vegetables appears protective.2416 When presented with more diverse options of fruits,2417 vegetables,2418 and vegetable seasonings,2419 people may consume a larger quantity, crowding out less healthy options.

For the first twenty years of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it recommended generally eating “a variety of foods.” In the new millennium, the guidelines have gotten more precise, specifying a diversity of healthier foods only. As dietitians at Harvard and NYU concluded in a paper on dietary variety as an overlooked weight-loss strategy, “Choose and prepare a greater variety of plant-based foods,” recognizing that a greater variety of less healthy options could be counterproductive.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

How can we respond to industry attempts to lure us into temptation by turning our natural biological drives against us? Should we never eat really delicious food? No, but it may help to recognize the effects hyperpalatable foods can have on hijacking our appetites and undermining our bodies’ better judgment. We can also use some of those same primitive impulses to our advantage by monotonizing our choices of the bad and diversifying our choices of the good. Try picking out a new fruit or vegetable every time you shop.

In my own family’s home, we always have a wide array of healthy snacks on hand to entice the finickiest of tastes. The contrasting collage of colors and shapes in fruit baskets and vegetable platters beats out boring bowls of a single fruit because they make you want to mix it up and try a little of each. And with different dipping sauces, the possibilities are endless!

The Optimal Weight-Loss Diet

INTRODUCTION

Beyond the Seventeen Ingredients

****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Diets don’t work almost by definition. Going on a diet implies that, at some point, you will go off the diet. Short-term fixes are no match for long-term problems.2421 Lifelong weight control requires lifelong lifestyle changes. That’s why there are four other factors that need to be considered alongside my seventeen efficacy criteria, bringing us to twenty-one total ingredients for an optimal weight-loss diet. See the chart on the next page.

First, a diet has to be sustainable. Consider water-only fasting, for example. No diet works better. It’s 100 percent effective, but also 100 percent fatal if you manage to stick with it. This is why an optimal weight-loss diet needs additional building blocks to ensure long-term viability.

As well as being efficacious and sustainable, it needs to be safe. Books touting liquid protein diets in the 1970s sold millions of copies, but the diets started killing people.2422 Safety is about losing weight without losing your health.

Any long-term eating pattern must also be nutritionally complete, containing all essential vitamins and minerals. A vegan diet, for example, can fail at this criterion, as it lacks vitamin B12, which is not made by plants but by microbes that blanket the earth. In today’s sanitized modern world, we now chlorinate the water supply to kill off any bacteria, so we don’t get a lot of B12 in our water anymore—but we don’t get a lot of cholera either, which is a good thing! Without that vitamin, though, vegans eventually risk blindness,2423 psychosis,2424 paralysis,2425 and death,2426 which is why B12 supplements or B12-fortified foods are critically important for anyone adopting a plant-based diet.

And finally, our chosen diets should be life-extending. At the very least, what we eat shouldn’t cut our lives short and ideally should be healthy enough to improve our life spans. There’s no point in losing weight if it causes you to lose it all.


Low-Carb Diets Don’t Hold Water

So what diet contains the most of the twenty-one ingredients for weight loss? Let’s start with the classic dichotomy: low-carb versus low-fat. A meta-analysis of forty-eight randomized trials of various branded diets found that those advised to eat low-carb diets and those told to eat low-fat diets lost nearly identical amounts of weight after a year (averaging 7.25 kg and 7.27 kg, respectively, about 16 pounds).2428 High attrition rates and poor dietary adherence complicate comparisons of efficacy,2429 but you can see how both approaches tick off important checkboxes. The four largest calorie contributors in the American diet are (1) refined grains, (2) added fats, (3) meat, and (4) added sugars.2430 Low-carb diets cut down on #1 and #4, and low-fat diets tend to cut down on #2 and #3.

The hook for low-carbohydrate diets that may explain their recurring popularity since the 1860s is the rapid water loss that can accompany them. Put people on a ketogenic, eight-hundred-calorie-a-day, low-carbohydrate diet, and they lose ten pounds in ten days, compared to only six pounds lost on the same number of calories of a higher-carb diet. Same calories, yet four more pounds gone. What the bathroom scale isn’t telling you, though, is that those four extra pounds were all water. Indeed, in the first week of a ketogenic diet, most of the weight lost is in water, not fat. On those same eight hundred calories a day, fat loss was nearly the same (163.4 grams a day on the ketogenic diet compared to 166.7 grams on the regular diet).2431

When you eat carbohydrates, your body bulks up your muscles with glycogen for quick energy. Eat a high-carb diet for three days, and you may add about two pounds of muscle mass on your arms and legs.2432 Those glycogen stores drain away on a low-carb diet and pull water out with them. The ketones also need to be flushed out of the kidneys on a ketogenic diet, accounting for the diuretic effect.2433

The thrill of seeing the pounds drop so quickly on the scale, though, keeps many keto crazy. When the diet fails, the dieters often blame themselves, but the intoxication of the initial rapid weight loss may tempt them back. It’s like getting drunk again after forgetting how terrible the last hangover felt. This has been dubbed the false hope syndrome. The diet business thrives off two things—preposterous promises and repeat customers—and one leads naturally to the other.



Making Daily Allowances
When people diet, they often increase their risk of not meeting all their essential nutrient requirements. Ketogenic diets tend to be so nutritionally vacuous that one assessment estimated that in order to get a sufficient daily intake of all essential vitamins and minerals, you’d have to eat 37,500 calories a day.2446 Choosing a healthier diet may be easier than adding about fifty sticks of butter to your morning coffee.

A comparison of dietary quality of popular weight-loss plans scored Ornish’s low-fat, plant-based diet the highest and Atkins’s low-carb, more ketogenic diet the lowest.2447 In general, using a variety of nutritional quality indexes, researchers found that the more plant-based people eat, the healthier their diet scores.2448 Ironically, even though plant-based eaters are restricting entire categories of foods, they end up getting more nutrition. A paper entitled “A Vegetarian Dietary Pattern as a Nutrient-Dense Approach to Weight Management” found that those eating more plant-based were getting higher intakes of nearly every nutrient: more fiber, more vitamin A, more vitamin C, more vitamin E, more of the B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, and folate, and more of the minerals calcium, magnesium, and iron.2449 This came as no surprise. The Journal of the American Dietetic Association editor in chief responded, “What could be more nutrient dense than a vegetarian diet?”2450

These days, it seems that most published cases of classic nutrient-deficiency syndromes showing up in U.S. emergency rooms are people eating crazy diets. An American servicemember hospitalized for a muscle tear due to scurvy reported eating only two things: chicken without the skin and candy bars.2451 Ironically, one of the healthiest eating patterns, an exclusively plant-based diet, is perhaps the most life-threateningly incomplete, lacking B12, a vitamin made by bacteria, as I mentioned earlier. In our modern sanitary world, vitamin B12 is found reliably only in animal products, supplements, and B12-fortified foods. Vegetarians and vegans are recommended to take supplements containing at least 50 mcg of cyanocobalamin (the most stable form2452) a day or at least 2,000 mcg once a week2453 (or brush twice daily with a B12-fortified toothpaste2454).

We’re getting closer to the optimal weight-loss diet, but we aren’t quite there—yet.


****************************************************************************************************
Easy as Pie
Just because a diet is healthy and effective doesn’t mean it’s sustainable. Obviously, diets can only work if people can stick with them. When Dean Ornish, the first to prove heart disease could be reversed with a plant-based lifestyle program, criticized the authors of a famous Mediterranean diet study for exaggerating the benefits—noting there was no reduction in heart attack rates or overall mortality2457—the authors replied, acknowledging Ornish-type diets might be superior but the “major problems … are its poor palatability and the marginal long-term compliance.”2458 Excuse me? In reality, Ornish and others got extraordinary adherence with healthy plant-based diets, with no differences noted in any measured acceptability scores. For example, study participants reported the same level of enjoyment compared to their regular diets.2459 They even got success in barbecue country, rural North Carolina.2460 Stricter diets may meet greater acceptance because they may work better. Ornish and colleagues showed that greater adherence meant greater disease reversal.2461

Even those who are young and healthy with no health issues appear to have little problem sticking to a plant-based diet. There was a crossover study in which women were instructed to eat plant-based foods for a few months to see how it would affect their menstrual cycles. But then they were to switch back to their baseline diets to note the contrast, a so-called A-B-A study design where you reverse the experimental variable. The problem is that some participants felt so good eating healthfully—they were losing weight without any calorie counting or portion control, they had more energy, their periods got better, and they experienced better digestion and better sleep—that some refused to go back to their regular diets, which kind of messes up the study.2462 Because they didn’t comply with the protocol and go back to their baseline diets, their data had to be thrown out. So, ironically, the plant-based diet worked a little too well.


Heftier Diets, Lighter Bodies

Obesity rates among vegans may run as low as 2–3 percent,2477 which makes it difficult to tease out the health effects of plant-based eating. Are the lower disease rates associated with plant-based eating due directly to the diet itself or indirectly to the ease of weight loss and maintenance? To find control groups of individuals eating typical diets who were as slim as a group of whole-food vegans, studies have had to recruit long-distance endurance athletes running an average of forty-eight miles per week for twenty-one years. Apparently, people who run the equivalent of almost two marathons a week for two decades can be as slim as a vegan no matter what they eat! What’s more, the purely plant-based eaters in the studies were sedentary, exercising for less than an hour a week.2478 So run two thousand miles a year, and your weight may rival that of some vegan couch potatoes? What’s their secret?

The simplest explanation is that those eating more plant-based may just be eating fewer calories—as many as 464 fewer calories a day, in fact.2479 That would certainly do it. That’s nearly the 500-a-day caloric restriction recommended in the federal dietary guidelines for weight loss.2480 But this calorie reduction was achieved without significantly changing the amount of food eaten. Some studies show that those eating purely plant-based diets are actually eating nearly a half pound more food a day compared to nonvegetarians.2481 That’s the beauty of foods with low calorie density: more food, less weight.


Metabolic Boost
Yes, those eating plant-based may be eating fewer calories, but they may also need fewer calories. Heavier people have higher calorie requirements because of the energy it takes just to move around all that extra mass, so it could go both ways. Higher caloric intake can lead to obesity, and obesity can also lead to higher caloric intake. But in fact, some studies have found that those eating more plant-based had the same2482,2483 or even higher caloric intakes,2484,2485 which makes it even more curious that plant-based eaters are slimmer.

A study in Israel, for example, found that vegetarians weighed about twenty pounds less than nonvegetarians, yet they appeared to be eating about four hundred more calories every day.2486 As we saw in the High in Fiber-Rich Foods section, it’s not what you eat but what you absorb, and the Israeli vegetarians were eating extraordinarily healthy diets, averaging nearly seventy grams of fiber a day. This could help explain why those eating more whole plant foods seem to lose more weight even at the same estimated caloric intake.2487 Interestingly, a similar paradox arose in rural China at even half the fiber intake.2488

Before the Westernization of their diets, the rural Chinese got about 90 percent of their protein from plants. Even the least active “office workers” ate 30 percent more calories than Americans, yet were 25 percent leaner.2489 Of course, they may have been biking to the office or something, but the calories still didn’t seem to add up. It turns out that those eating more plant-based may effectively be burning more calories in their sleep.

In 1994, researchers discovered that those eating more plant-based for at least two years had an 11 percent higher resting metabolic rate.2490 Their metabolisms just seemed to be revved up naturally, which could help account for the greater weight loss. However, three subsequent studies failed to replicate this finding, but the reported fiber intakes of those studies averaged only eleven grams a day,2491,2492,2493 which is less than what is consumed on the Standard American Diet. The only way for vegetarians to get that little fiber is to center their diets around highly processed junk. (The rural Chinese, in comparison, were getting thirty-three grams a day.) The latest study, which involved a more respectable fiber intake, found a 22 percent higher resting metabolic rate, which translates into burning off hundreds of extra calories a day without doing a thing. The researchers concluded that this “underlines the need to encourage people to follow a plant-based diet.”


****************************************************************************************************
Eat Seven Pounds, Lose Seven Pounds
All the studies that have consistently shown that those who eat more vegetarian meals tend to be slimmer could have been confounded by other diet or lifestyle factors. Even the studies that take such factors as physical activity, smoking, and socioeconomic class into account may not control for other dietary aspects. For example, vegetarians and vegans tend to drink less soda, eat fewer sweets, and use less added fats.2495 Maybe any eat-less-junk-food diet would have similar benefits. You don’t know until you put it to the test.

A meta-analysis of a dozen randomized controlled trials involving more than a thousand research subjects found that those placed in the more plant-based groups lost significantly more weight.2496 This included studies that compared plant-based nutrition to other diets also emphasizing healthier eating. A larger systematic review of clinical trials lasting at least a month or more found that those who stuck to the more plant-based diets lost about ten pounds, and this was without any instruction for exercise or caloric restriction. Even more remarkably, weight loss wasn’t even the specific goal for most of the studies. They were just set up to test the effects of plant-based diets on conditions like arthritis, diabetes, or painful periods, and the weight loss appeared to be just an inadvertent, happy side effect.2497

Just like in the observational studies showing the more plant-based people ate, the leaner they appeared to be, the same trend was uncovered when people were randomized to different degrees of plant-based eating.2498 Those randomized to eat purely plant-based lost more weight than those just avoiding meat, as well as those eating pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, or full omnivore. By the end of the six-month study, those randomized to eat a completely plant-based diet lost twice as much weight compared to those who ate any fish or other meat, with 7.5 percent of their body weights lost, compared to about 3 percent.2499 That may only translate into a few pounds of steady weight loss a month, but, again, this was achieved without added exercise, calorie counting, or portion control. Subjects on the plant-based diet were instructed to eat however much they wanted, whenever they wanted. That’s the kind of diet one can stick to long term.

Those who follow a whole food, plant-based diet for years can lose dozens of pounds.2500 In Dr. Dean Ornish’s landmark heart disease reversal study, those randomized to the plant-based lifestyle group dropped an average of twenty-four pounds even though most weren’t obese or explicitly attempting to lose weight, and they did so while eating as much as they wanted.2501 They did, however, have the added motivation of a heart disease diagnosis to stick with the program.

Residential plant-based programs, where you may stay in a spa-like setting for a week, can be very successful for the time you’re there. For example, participants in Dr. John McDougall’s live-in program lose an average of three pounds a week eating unlimited, all-you-can-eat buffets.2502 One whole-food immersion demonstrated more than seven pounds lost in one week eating nearly seven pounds of food a day.2503 Live-in programs can be great for optimizing clinical benefits because they can exert greater control over people’s diets, but not only are such programs expensive, participants are dumped right back into their toxic food environments at home—the very ones that caused the problems in the first place.

Hans Diehl, the first director of research at the Pritikin Center, recognized the limitations of the live-in approach. Inspired by the amazing results he was seeing (including those of a certain beloved Grandma Greger), he developed a volunteer-run education program that could be offered in the community. He called it CHIP, the Coronary Health Improvement Project.

The Weight-Loss Program That Got Better with Time
Residential lifestyle programs can cost thousands of dollars in addition to missed work time, whereas CHIP was designed to be cheap. And what good is it to spoon-feed people an ideal diet only to unleash them back home to their cupboards of cookies? CHIP offers evening classes to teach people how to eat and stay healthy within their home environments. The focus of the program is what CHIP calls the Optimal Diet, one centered around whole plant foods. The program isn’t dogmatic. Instead, it simply encourages people to move along the spectrum toward incorporating more “foods as grown” into their diets.2504

CHIP doesn’t provide meals—just advice and encouragement, empowering people with knowledge.2505 Within a month on the program, blood sugars, cholesterol, and blood pressures dropped enough for many participants to drop their antidiabetic, cholesterol-lowering, and blood pressure–lowering medications. Better numbers on fewer drugs, along with an average six-pound weight loss.2506 But what about long term? The only true test of any lifestyle intervention is whether or not it actually changes your lifestyle. So researchers followed up with CHIP participants after eighteen months to see if any of the healthy habits stuck.

By the end of the four-week educational program, people were averaging about three hundred fewer calories per day, even though they were explicitly told to eat as much as they wanted.2507 There was no calorie or carb counting and no portion control. Instead of eating less food, they just ate healthier food. Great news, but that three hundred fewer daily calories was the case immediately after four weeks of classes. Where were the participants eighteen months later?

Those familiar with weight-loss studies know how this works. You can excite anyone in the short term to lose weight using nearly any kind of diet, but what happens six months later or a year later? Most tend to gain it all back, or even more. CHIP participants, who had been eating about three hundred fewer calories a day during the program, were eating four hundred fewer calories eighteen months later.2508 Hold on. What kind of diet can work even better the longer you’re on it? The participants were eating even fewer calories more than a year after finishing the educational program. That’s one of the strengths of a diet centered around whole plant foods. Many weight-loss programs restrict caloric intake by limiting portion sizes or using meal replacements, which can result in hunger and dissatisfaction, thereby contributing to poor compliance and weight regain.2509 The satiety-promoting, all-you-care-to-eat, plant-based, whole-food dietary approach may therefore be a potent tool for sustainable weight loss.

The CHIP program has since become perhaps the most well-published community-based lifestyle intervention in the medical literature,2510 with studies involving more than five thousand participants.2511 People didn’t just lose weight and improve their physical health; they achieved significant improvements in feelings of stress and sleeping disorders. After four weeks on the program, there was a greater than 50 percent drop in reported insomnia, restless sleeping, easy emotional upset, and feelings of fearfulness or depression.2512 With randomized controlled trials showing both physical2513 and mental health2514 benefits, CHIP’s name was changed from the Coronary Health Improvement Project to the Complete Health Improvement Program.

Dr. Diehl put it best when he said:

As a society, I think we are largely at the mercy of powerful and manipulative marketing forces that basically tell us … what to eat.… Everywhere we look, we’re being seduced to the “good life” as marketers define it, but … this so-called “good life” has produced in this country an avalanche of morbidity and mortality [disease and death].… What I would like to see in America is not this “good life” but the “best life.” The best life is a simpler lifestyle—one characterized by eating more whole foods, foods-as-grown.

****************************************************************************************************
All in It to Win It
Dieting comes with an expiration date—the time at which we go off the diet (and all too often back to the habits that got us into trouble in the first place). Permanent weight loss requires permanent dietary changes. Healthier habits just need to become a way of life. That means the new eating pattern has to be one you can stick with and also, ideally, be health-promoting overall. If it’s going to be lifelong, you want it to lead to a long life. Is it too much to ask for one diet to be effective, sustainable, and life-extending?

Might there be an inherent conflict between efficacy and sustainability? Wouldn’t smaller changes be easier to maintain? Even in the barbecue capital of Memphis, Tennessee, researchers got about an 80 percent six-month compliance rate with a purely plant-based diet, with no adherence benefit found for adding a small daily portion of meat and dairy.2516 As we’ve discussed, completely avoiding some problem foods may paradoxically sometimes be even easier than attempting to moderate their intakes.2517 This is readily apparent in the substance-use literature, where entirely avoiding alcohol is more effective and, ironically, easier for a problem drinker than just cutting down.2518

Studies recommending greater dietary changes can produce greater changes in behavior.2519 For example, in that study randomizing people to four different degrees of plant-based eating—(1) entirely plants, (2) just meat-free, (3) meat-free except for fish, or (4) flexitarian with some meat—all four diets ended up with similar acceptability and adherence, even among those who were initially unhappy with their assignments.2520 In fact, even among those who ended up being noncompliant, those assigned to the completely meat-free groups ended up making more changes (and losing significantly more weight) than the omnivore controls.2521 So rather than “All things in moderation,” a better aphorism may be “Big changes beget big results.”2522 That old adage “Shoot for the moon—if you fail, you will land among the stars” was obviously written by someone without even the vaguest understanding of astronomy, but the reverse does make decent dietary sense. So shoot for the stars!

Success breeds success. After a few weeks of eating more healthfully, you may feel so much healthier that your resolve is reinforced. When surveyed, those who choose to eat plant-based for health reasons say it’s mostly for general wellness or disease prevention, or to improve their energy levels or immune function. They report it gave them a sense of control over their health, helped them feel better emotionally, and improved their overall health. Most who made the transition for a specific health problem (most commonly for high cholesterol, weight loss, high blood pressure, or diabetes) say it helped them a great deal.2523 But let’s not just take their word for it. Let’s put it to the test.


The Best of Both Worlds
Obviously, with very-low-calorie starvation diets, you can drop people down to any weight, but quick fixes tend to quickly unravel,2528 whereas the whole point of whole food, plant-based nutrition is to maximize long-term health and longevity. I mean, even if, for example, low-carb, ketogenic diets were found to be as effective (and they don’t appear to be),2529 the point of weight loss is not to fit into a skinnier casket.

Beyond just the increased rates of constipation, headache, bad breath, muscle cramps, general weakness, and rash reported on low-carbohydrate diets,2530 people whose diets simply tend to sway that way appear to live significantly shorter lives.2531 On the other hand, eating plant-based2532 or even just trending in the direction of eating more healthy plant foods is associated with increased likelihood of living longer.2533 Those who start out more plant-based but then add meat to their diets at least once a week not only appear to double or triple their odds of diabetes, stroke, heart diseases, and weight gain but suffer an associated 3.6-year drop in life expectancy.2534

Thank goodness it’s hard to stick to something like a ketogenic diet, since the long-term, adverse health effects could be devastating. Whereas low-carb diets have been shown to impair artery function2535 and worsen heart disease,2536 whole food, plant-based diets have been shown to actually reverse heart disease.2537

So what appears to be the most effective weight-loss diet just so happens to be the only diet ever proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients. If that’s all a plant-based diet could do—reverse the number one killer of men and women—shouldn’t that be the default diet until proven otherwise? And the fact that it can also be effective in treating, arresting, and even reversing other leading killers like high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes would seem to make the case for plant-based eating simply overwhelming. Only one diet has ever been shown to do all that: a diet centered around whole plant foods.

We don’t have to forsake our health to lose weight. The single healthiest diet may also be the most effective diet for weight loss.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Health by Design

Isn’t it all a bit too convenient? The same foods that check off the most ideal weight-loss ingredients are the same foods that rack up the most points on health and longevity? And whole plant foods aren’t just heart-healthy, but brain-, kidney-, and liver-healthy too. What are the odds?

This becomes clearer when we think about some of the underlying physiology. Yes, whole food, plant-based nutrition is the only diet proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients, opening up arteries without drugs or surgery. However, the heart muscle isn’t the only organ that requires blood flow to bring in oxygen and nutrients and to clear out waste products. Perhaps it’s no coincidence then that the diet found best to improve blood flow can support the health of all our organ systems. There are other causal factors such as inflammation that could explain why such an anti-inflammatory diet could affect multiple disease conditions at once, including obesity.

It may also be instructive to take an even further step back and look at our ancestral history. Millions of years before we learned how to sharpen spears, mill grains, or boil sugarcane, our entire physiology is presumed to have evolved in the context of eating what the rest of our great ape cousins eat—leaves, stems, and shoots (in other words, vegetables), fruits, seeds, and nuts.2538 The Paleolithic period, when we started using tools, only goes back about two million years. We and other great apes have been evolving since the Miocene era, more like twenty million years ago.2539 So for the first 90 percent of our hominoid existence, our bodies evolved on mostly plants.2540

We’ve known for more than a century that you can clog the arteries of herbivores like rabbits by feeding them meat, eggs, and dairy,2541 but it’s virtually impossible to induce atherosclerosis in a carnivore with cholesterol because that’s part of their natural diets.2542 Similarly, rats eating rat food don’t get fat, but give them Oreos and it’s a different story. Perhaps it’s no wonder that our bodies may thrive best on the diet we were designed to eat. So maybe we should go back to our roots.

AMPING AMPK

The Fat Controller

The universal energy currency in all of biology is a molecule called adenosine triphosphate, commonly known as ATP. The tri in triphosphate means three, as in tricycle or, in this case, ATP’s three phosphates, where energy is stored. Plants make ATP with energy from the sun, and animals make it by burning fat, carbohydrates, and protein. The energy is spent by releasing the phosphates, which transforms ATP to AMP—adenosine monophosphate, with mono meaning one—which then can be juiced up with two more phosphates back to ATP, and the cycle continues. In this way, every cell in our bodies and in every living thing is like a little rechargeable battery; AMP molecules are charged up with phosphates to ATP using sunlight or food and then drained back down to AMP to do the cell’s work. This brings us to AMPK, or AMP-activated protein kinase.

A kinase is a type of enzyme. What might be the function of an enzyme activated by AMP? A buildup of AMP means the rechargeable battery is running low. It’s akin to the fuel gauge in your car reading empty. As the needle creeps toward the E, what do you do? Add more fuel. But instead of having an extra gas can in your trunk, you may have junk in the trunk—fat stores on your body. So that’s what AMPK does: It flips the switch in your body from storing fat to burning fat. That’s why AMPK is not only known as the master energy sensor2584 in our bodies but also the fat controller.2585

The discovery of AMPK is considered one of the most important biomedical breakthroughs in the last few decades.2586 But can it be used to lose weight? If we could find a way to boost its activity, our bodies would burn more fat. The two obvious ways to deplete our energy stores to activate AMPK are exercise and fasting. Put people on a bike and start taking muscle biopsies while they cycle, and you can detect a near tripling of AMPK activity within twenty minutes.2587 That makes sense. The muscles use up the ATP to contract, so AMP builds up and AMPK is activated. That’s one of the ways exercise leads to weight loss.

AMPK activation also leads to mitochondrial biogenesis, meaning the formation of extra mitochondria, the power plants within our cells where fat is burned and ATP is created.2588 So AMPK doesn’t just cause more fat to be shoveled into the furnace—it also causes more furnaces to be built. In this way, AMPK helps explain why endurance training eventually enables us to run faster and farther. So might an AMPK activator be like the fabled exercise in a pill? Indeed, an AMPK-activator drug given to sedentary mice for a month boosted their running endurance by 44 percent.2589 After one such drug was discovered at the famed Tour de France,2590 AMPK activators were banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.2591

Even more so than performance boosters, Big Pharma has interest in the obesity market. Obese individuals are often “unwilling to perform even a minimum of physical activity,” wrote a group of pharmacologists, “thus, indicating that drugs mimicking endurance exercise are highly desirable.”2592 The thought is that AMPK activation could mimic caloric restriction, effectively fasting in a pill.2593 When we stop eating, our energy gets depleted, so AMPK is activated and switches us over to start burning through our own fat stores. Might AMPK activation thereby allow us to reap the fat-burning benefits of exercise and fasting without the sweat and hunger?

Losing weight through AMPK activation is not that simple, since in our brains it revs up our appetites, which makes sense. Our fat stores can’t last forever, so, in addition to tapping into our tummy fat, AMPK drives us to eat more to make up for the energy deficit. AMPK is one of the reasons we get hungry after a workout (or when we starve ourselves). That’s the way the antipsychotic drug Zyprexa makes people gain weight—by boosting AMPK activity in the brain.2594 So, for weight control, we’d ideally suppress the activity of AMPK in the brain but ramp it up throughout the rest of our bodies,2595 which is exactly how nicotine appears to work.

****************************************************************************************************
Pepper Uppers

Smoking cigarettes may be one of the worst things you can do your body, but it’s also one of the most reliable ways to lose weight.2596 This is thought to be due to the contrasting effects nicotine has on AMPK activation in the brain and body.2597 Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies show that nicotine reduces appetite2598 and caloric intake.2599 At the same time, fat biopsies taken from smokers show more than five times the AMPK activation compared to fat taken from nonsmokers.2600 No wonder people tend to gain weight when they quit smoking,2601 a phenomenon that can be blunted with nicotine gum.2602

Is there any way to get the weight-loss benefits of smoking without having to worry about the whole dying-a-horrific-death-from-lung-cancer thing? If you may remember from my Parkinson’s disease chapter in How Not to Die, tobacco isn’t the only plant with nicotine. Tobacco is a member of the nightshade family, along with tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and bell peppers, and they all contain nicotine as well.2603 This is why smokers can’t be identified just by looking for the presence of nicotine in their toenail clippings. Because nicotine is in the food supply, nonsmokers grow out some nicotine into their nails too.2604

The total amount of nicotine we eat in our daily diets is hundreds of times less than we would get from a single cigarette, though. So while we’ve known for at least twenty years that there’s nicotine in ketchup, it’s been dismissed as insignificant.2605 We then learned that just one or two puffs of a cigarette could saturate half of our brains’ primary nicotine receptors.2606 Even the minuscule nicotine exposure from secondhand smoke may protect against Parkinson’s,2607 and we can get about the same nicotine exposure eating some vegetables in a nonsmoking restaurant that we’d get working in a smoky one.2608

Researchers have found that consumption of nightshade vegetables, particularly peppers and maybe tomatoes and potatoes2609 as well, is associated with a significantly lower risk of Parkinson’s disease among nonsmokers.2610 If there is enough nicotine in these vegetables to affect Parkinson’s risk, might there be enough to tweak AMPK activation? In other words, might a peck of peppers make Peter Piper less peckish?

Green pepper juice does have anti-obesity effects on mice,2611 and a sweet pepper extract was shown to have an appetite-suppressing 2612 and abdominal fat–reducing effect on human subjects.2613 Though there has yet to be an interventional study with actual foods to see if nightshade vegetables have a particular benefit, why not give them a try? Nonsmokers using nicotine gum can risk long-term addiction,2614 but I’ve never heard of anyone becoming a stuffed pepper addict.


Raising the Barberries
More than one hundred plant products have been found to activate AMPK. Nicotine is one, and berberine, which can be found in barberries, is another.2615 In How Not to Die, barberries held the distinction of making it onto two of my favorites lists, as one of my top picks for berries and also for herbs and spices.

Barberries first came across my radar as the single most antioxidant-packed dried fruit I could find. There are some exotic fruits that beat them (with Dr. Seussian names like whortleberries), but in terms of what I could find in stores, barberries trumped dried pomegranate seeds and goji berries, two other top contenders.2616 Barberries are readily and inexpensively found at Middle Eastern groceries, as they’re used to make a signature Persian rice dish.

Their taste is described in the medical literature as “pleasantly acidulous,”2617 which is doctor-speak for sour. I had just been sprinkling them on my oatmeal because they’re so tasty, but evidently they’ve played a prominent role in traditional systems of healing around the world for thousands of years. In fact, one pharmacology journal flamboyantly described barberries as an “herbal remedy that has no match in serving [the] human race.”2618 And I thought they were just kind of tangy.

A common problem with the herbal medicine literature is that there is often a long, impressive list of traditional uses but little or no science to back up the claims.2619 The science that does exist is often either petri dish or lab animal data with questionable clinical applicability. Who cares if barberries have a “menstruation induction effect in guinea pig”2620 (except maybe the guinea pig)? You end up with scientists injecting herbs into the penises of rabbits in hopes of coming up with the next Viagra,2621 but few human studies.

That changed recently. I produced a video for NutritionFacts.org that discussed a clinical trial of barberries for acne. Teenagers randomized to take about a teaspoon of dried barberries, roughly eight cents’ worth, three times a day for a month experienced a dramatic 45 percent drop in inflamed pimples compared to the placebo control group.2622 That’s great news for zits, but what about barberries for weight loss?

Purified berberine, the purported active ingredient in barberries, has been shown successfully to induce weight loss in randomized controlled studies,2623,2624,2625 earning it a patent as a “weight-loss agent.”2626 But because the supplement industry is so poorly regulated, you never know what’s in the bottle. An analysis of fifteen berberine supplements on the market found that 60 percent failed to match what was claimed on their labels.2627

The closest we have to a whole-food barberry intervention for weight loss is a trial from 2018. Diabetics randomized to drink about a cup of barberry juice each day for two months lost about six pounds more than those in the control group (and also had better blood sugars and pressures). Unfortunately, the researchers didn’t use a placebo, like barberry-flavored Kool-Aid. The control group didn’t get any intervention at all, which is problematic because we know that anytime doing something is compared to doing nothing, the placebo effect can come into play. At the same time, the barberry group received an extra ninety calories every day through the juice, yet still ended up losing more weight than the no-juice group.2628

A note of caution: Barberries are classified as unsafe to eat during pregnancy and are not recommended for consumption while breastfeeding.2629 The reason so many different plants produce compounds that end up activating AMPK may be because they are trying to fend off nibbling herbivores by producing compounds that impair animal metabolism. Cyanide, for example, is an AMPK activator too. Cyanide can kill by completely blocking energy production, whereas compounds like berberine are thought to just impair our mitochondrial function, making energy production less efficient.2630 It’s this inefficiency that may be what’s driving the weight loss.

Is there any way to activate AMPK without mucking with our mitochondria? Alcohol is another plant product that shouldn’t be used during pregnancy and activates AMPK, but by a totally different mechanism. Alcohol is detoxified in the body into acetic acid, which our bodies have to use ATP to metabolize.2631 AMPK is therefore activated naturally in response to the energy expenditure.2632 The problem is that before alcohol gets fully converted into acetic acid, there’s a toxic intermediate called acetaldehyde, which is a known carcinogen. That may be why alcohol consumption is understood to increase the risk of at least a half dozen different cancers,2633 including breast cancer, even among light drinkers.2634

If only there were a way to skip the toxic step and take in acetic acid directly.

Take an Acid Trip

In a review on the role of AMPK in burning off excess body fat, an investigator concluded that “it is crucial that oral compounds with high bioavailability are developed to safely induce chronic AMPK activation … [for] long-term weight loss and maintenance.”2635 There is no need to develop such a compound, though, since you can already buy it any grocery store in the form of vinegar.

Acetic is derived from the Latin word acetum, meaning vinegar. By definition, vinegar is just a dilute solution of acetic acid in water.2636 The acetic acid is absorbed and metabolized with ATP, and we get a natural AMPK boost. Enough of a boost to lose weight at the typical dose you might get dressing a salad? Evidently, vinegar has been used to treat obesity for centuries,2637 but only recently has it been put to the test.

Researchers in Japan performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on the effects of vinegar intake on the reduction of body fat in 155 overweight men and women. The subjects were randomly split into one of three groups: a high-dose vinegar group drinking a beverage containing two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar a day, a low-dose group drinking a beverage with one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar a day, or a placebo control group drinking an acidic beverage developed to taste the same as the vinegar drink but prepared with a different kind of acid so it didn’t have any acetic acid. The researchers monitored the subjects’ diets and gave each of them a pedometer to make sure the only significant difference among the three groups was the amount and type of vinegar they were getting every day.2638

By the end of the first month, there was already a significant drop in weight in both the high-dose and low-dose vinegar groups compared to placebo, with the high-dose group doing better than the low-dose one, and both vinegar groups continued to lose weight each month. In contrast, by month three, the do-nothing placebo group had gained weight (as overweight people tend to do), whereas the vinegar groups had dropped weight significantly. Like any weight-loss strategy, it only works if you do it. A month after the vinegar was stopped, the weight crept right back, but that’s just additional evidence that the vinegar was working.2639

Was the weight loss simply statistically significant or actually significant? That’s for you to decide. During the three-month trial, compared to the placebo group, the group taking one daily tablespoon of vinegar steadily lost about a pound a month and the group taking two daily tablespoons were down a total of about five pounds. Five pounds may not sound like a lot, but that weight loss was achieved for just pennies a day without removing anything from their diets.2640

The vinegar groups also got slimmer, losing about an inch off their waistlines compared to placebo, suggesting they were burning abdominal fat. The researchers went the extra mile by putting the subjects through a CT scanner. That way, they could directly measure the amount of fat before and after the trial, both the superficial fat under the skin that makes for flabby arms and contributes to cellulite, and the visceral fat, which is the fat that builds up around our internal organs and bulges out our bellies. Visceral fat is the killer fat, which is what the placebo group was putting on. Both vinegar groups, however, experienced a drop in visceral fat, removing about a square inch off the CT scan slice.2641

Perhaps, a competing research group suggested,2642 the vinegar drinks were just so unappealing they were ruining the subjects’ appetites, while somehow the placebo drink wasn’t (despite being developed to taste similarly). The diets of all three groups were analyzed, and there were no significant changes in the caloric intakes of any of the groups. So same diets, yet more weight loss in the vinegar groups. That sounds like AMPK activation ignited the fat stores, but you don’t know until you put it to the test.

Experiments in a petri dish on human cells (from umbilical cords, a convenient source of human tissue) show that acetic acid can amp up AMPK,2643 but there’s only one way to find out if that’s what is happening in our bodies. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vinegar was performed by a research group in Korea (this time using pomegranate vinegar). The researchers found the same visceral fat loss on CT scan but took the further step of taking abdominal fat biopsies from study subjects. The fat in those on the vinegar drink was found to have nearly three times the AMPK activation compared to fat taken from those on the placebo drinks, confirming the suspected mechanism.2644

The CT scan and biopsies make for very expensive studies, so I was not surprised to learn that they were funded by companies that sell vinegars. On the one hand, that’s good, since, otherwise, studies like this might not be performed, but on the other hand, financial conflicts of interest always raise the concern as to whether the funding source somehow manipulated the results. The nice thing about companies funding studies about healthy foods, though, is that there’s less of a downside. I mean, what’s the worst that can happen? Even if we discover one day there was vinegar company meddling and all the findings extolling the virtues of vinegar turn out to be bogus, worse comes to worst, you just would have been eating tastier salads.

Optimal Vinegar Dosing

Treating obesity wasn’t the only old-fashioned medicinal use for vinegar. Before the advent of blood sugar–lowering medications, vinegar was used as a folk remedy for diabetes.2645 Nobody bothered to formally test this, though, until 1988.2646 After all, how much money can be made from vinegar? Apparently, millions of dollars, according to the Vinegar Institute,2647 but a single diabetes drug can pull in billions, like Rezulin did before it was pulled from the market for killing too many people, that is (by causing liver failure).2648 The pharmaceutical company Pfizer still made out like a bandit, though, having to pay out less than a billion dollars to the grieving families for covering up the hazards of its drug.2649

In a study refreshingly not funded by a vinegar company, two daily tablespoons of apple cider vinegar mixed into a drink reduced fasting blood sugars in prediabetics an average of sixteen points within one week, which is better than what you’d tend to see with antidiabetic drugs like Glucophage or Avandia.2650 The vinegar was found to be safer, cheaper, and more effective. No wonder vinegar has been used medicinally since antiquity.

Adding just two teaspoons of vinegar to a high-glycemic meal (a bagel and juice) reduces the blood sugar spike by 23 percent.2651 A meta-analysis of eleven such studies found that vinegar taken with a meal significantly improves both blood sugar and insulin responses, and it didn’t seem to matter what kind of vinegar was used.2652 Originally, we thought this was because vinegar may be delaying the stomach-emptying rate,2653 but subsequent evidence revealed that taking vinegar at bedtime results in lower blood sugars the next morning,2654 so it can’t just be some stomach-slowing effect. The mystery was solved when a research team in Greece demonstrated that vinegar consumption improves the uptake of blood sugar by our muscles,2655 an AMPK effect also seen with exercise.2656

Adding vinegar to white bread doesn’t only lower blood sugar and insulin spikes—it also increases satiety, the feeling of being full after a meal.2657 When study subjects ate about four slices of white bread, they rated their satiety a three on a scale of one to ten, so they were just a little full. Two hours later, however, they ended up hungrier than even before they had eaten the four slices. When they ate that same amount of bread with some vinegar, though, they felt twice as full, with a satiety rating of around six out of ten, and, even two hours later, still felt nearly as full as they had when they had just eaten the four pieces of bread plain.2658

Many cultures have taken advantage of this synergy. Vinegar is mixed with high-glycemic foods like white rice in Japan, for example, to make sushi. Sourdough breads may lower blood sugar and insulin spikes2659 by the same mechanism.2660 You do the same thing when you add vinegar to white potatoes to make potato salad.2661 So if you are going to eat a high-glycemic food like white bread, dip that baguette in some balsamic.

There are some important caveats when it comes to vinegar, though. First, never drink it straight. It can cause intractable hiccups2662 and burn your esophagus,2663 as can apple cider vinegar tablets if they get lodged in your throat.2664 There’s another reason not to take apple cider vinegar tablets: They may not actually contain any apple cider vinegar, as was the case when eight different brands were tested.2665 Vinegar should also never be left on skin, soaked on a bandage, for example, as it can result in third-degree burns.2666

How much vinegar should we take? Though as many as a total of six tablespoons a day were not associated with any short-term side effects, until we know more, I’d recommend sticking with more common culinary-type doses, like two tablespoons a day, which is considered safe.2667 Acetic acid is metabolized quickly in the body,2668 so I’d recommend splitting up the daily dose to activate AMPK throughout the day, rather than taking it all at once. Given the additional mealtime benefits on blood sugars, insulin, and satiety, I’d recommend taking it with food. In the clinical trials, the belly fat–burning dose was two tablespoons a day. Splitting that over three meals would be two teaspoons a meal.

Syrupy Sweet
Acetic acid is a type of short-chain fatty acid. Where have we heard that term before? You read about it in the High in Fiber-Rich Foods section earlier in the book. That’s what our good bacteria make with the fiber and resistant starch we eat. When we eat whole plant foods, our gut flora can make acetic acid from scratch in our colons by fermenting the fiber. The acetic acid can then get absorbed back into our bloodstreams, so we can use the top-down approach to activate AMPK by consuming vinegar, or the bottoms-up approach by eating fiber.2669

Most studies on isolated prebiotic supplements and extracts for weight loss have been disappointing, with one “extreme”2670 exception, a study on yacon syrup. Fiber and resistant starch aren’t the only prebiotics. Our good bacteria also eat fructans, and a syrup made from roots of the yacon plant is a concentrated source. Yacon syrup has a caramel taste and is about half as sweet as honey2671 but with only one-third the calories2672 since most of the sugars are strung in the form of fructans, which we can’t digest, but our friendly flora can.2673

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to see if treating our flora to this bounty would help with weight loss, and the results seem too good to be true. Obese individuals randomized to just about four teaspoons of yacon syrup a day for 120 days lost nearly four inches off their waists and more than thirty pounds, whereas those on the placebo syrup gained weight.2674

With such extraordinary results, you’d think half the foods at the grocery store would be boasting “Now Made with Yacon!” on their labels by now. Presumably, the reason that isn’t the case is that it doesn’t take much to go overboard. The original study had a third part to it: People were randomized into the placebo syrup group, the four or so teaspoons of yacon syrup group, or a third group getting closer to nine daily teaspoons of yacon syrup. That larger dose group never made it into the study. That much yacon syrup may have excited their gut bacteria a little too much, resulting in such severe bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea that the entire group was excluded.2675

Fructans are one of the FODMAPs, which are fermentable sugars like lactose that can cause problems for some people. Those with irritable bowel syndrome, for example, who are placed on low-FODMAP diets tend to feel better. Much of this improvement may just be the placebo effect,2676 which can run as high as 91 percent in irritable bowel syndrome (meaning just giving IBS sufferers a sugar pill can sometimes make up to nine out of ten patients feel better).2677 The downside of giving it a try for IBS is that restricting healthy, high-FODMAP foods like apples and onions can deplete our microbiomes. FODMAP restriction has been found to result in a large reduction in beneficial Bifidobacteria within a matter of weeks.2678 That’s why even the research group who had come up with the FODMAP-restriction diet only recommends doing it for four weeks before starting to reincorporate the restricted foods back into the diet.2679

If a spoonful or two of yacon syrup doesn’t cause gastrointestinal upset for you, though, then, from a weight-loss standpoint, it could be a good replacement for something like honey, which, metabolically, was found to have the same effects as table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

To amp AMPK, I recommend trying two teaspoons of vinegar with each meal. You might be thinking, Wait—vinegar for breakfast? Those aghast at the thought of drizzling vinegar on their oatmeal may have never heard of chocolate vinegar, strawberry vinegar, or any of the dozens of other exotic flavors out there.

See if there’s a vinegar store near you where you can sample some of the more interesting varieties. That’s one of the fun things I do when I’m on the road. If I’m ever in your city, stake out the vinegar store closest to my hotel and odds are we’ll end up going tasting together. Unfortunately, TSA won’t let me take them back on the plane in my carry-on, but most stores have an online presence and offer mail order. There are savory varieties like hickory smoke, garlic, and herb vinegars for main dishes and sweet selections like apricot and blackberry ginger—and those are just the ones I happen to have in my kitchen right now!

You can also incorporate vinegar into your meals by always having a side salad or even adding it to tea with some lemon juice. For a bonus, you can slice some bell peppers and sprinkle some barberries on your salad, and, if you sweeten your tea with honey or sugar, try yacon syrup instead.

Just the Flax, Ma’am

Like chia seeds, flaxseeds have been shown to cause appetite suppression,2695 perhaps in part due to their large soluble fiber content, but does this translate into weight loss? One of the most extraordinary studies on flax was published in 2016. Overweight individuals were randomly assigned to receive either daily ground flaxseeds and lifestyle advice for weight loss, or just lifestyle advice alone. Since simply being enrolled in a study and knowing you’ll be weighed repeatedly can get people to lose weight,2696 it wasn’t a surprise that body weight, waist circumference, and body mass index decreased significantly in both groups. There was, however, a significantly greater reduction in the flaxseed group, and not just by a little.2697

Over the twelve-week study, the control group who had only gotten lifestyle advice lost nearly seven pounds and about an inch off their waists, while the group who had gotten the same advice along with spoonfuls of flaxseeds a day lost more than twenty pounds on average2698 and nearly four inches off their waists despite being given, in effect, more food to eat. Those are astonishing numbers for an intervention that added, rather than actively removed, calories from the diet. Was this study just some crazy flax fluke?

Another study pitted flaxseeds against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Thanks to the obesity epidemic, that’s now the most common liver disease, recognized as a major public health problem around the world. A high-fat diet may be the “most common cause,”2699 but the fat in flaxseeds (flaxseed oil), compared to lard, was found to be better for the liver—in rats.2700 That’s not particularly helpful. What about using whole flaxseeds in people?

Fatty liver patients were randomized using the same setup: lifestyle modification advice with or without flaxseeds. The flaxseed group was instructed to mix their daily ounce or so of ground flaxseeds with water or juice and to drink it after breakfast. Body weight dropped in both groups, along with liver fat, inflammation, and scarring, but significantly more so in the flaxseed group. Again, approximately twenty pounds were lost in three months after telling people to add something to their diets.2701 Perhaps that first study wasn’t just a fluke—or maybe they both were.

There have been more than a dozen randomized controlled trials of flaxseeds and weight loss, and when stacked up next to one another, the two twenty-pound weight-loss studies do appear to be the outliers.2702 Still, when all the studies are combined together in a meta-analysis, there was a significant reduction in body weight, BMI, and waist circumference following flaxseed supplementation. No benefit was found for flaxseed oil or flaxseed extract supplements, but randomized controlled trials of the whole food do show significant weight loss, though you should expect to drop closer to four pounds over a few months rather than twenty.


What About the Cyanide?

How Not to Die has been translated into thirty-four languages so far. Most of the time, all I have to do is just sit back and admire the creative new cover art, but some countries make publication contingent on a set of demands. The Japanese publisher, for example, wouldn’t release the book until I added an extra chapter on how not to die from stomach cancer, a leading killer in Japan. Understandable. The proviso from the Swedish publisher surprised me, though. Given my Daily Dozen recommendation to eat at least a tablespoon of ground flaxseed a day, I was asked to add a section on flaxseed safety.

The Swedish National Food Agency’s official website features a page warning people to stay away from ground flaxseed for fear of cyanide toxicity,2703 which helps explain why that was the subject of the first question I was asked when I gave a lecture in Stockholm. Was the Swedish government on to something? Had I been duped by Big Flax–funded researchers who claimed you could literally eat pounds of ground flaxseeds a day—more than 150 tablespoons daily—without worrying?2704

First, some background. As many as one in five of the plants we eat produces cyanide. In fact, if you look at the major food crops in the world, more than half are cyanogenic, meaning cyanide-producing.2705 Unlike toxins such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, which are chemical elements that can’t be broken down, cyanide is an organic molecule made up of one carbon atom attached to one nitrogen atom. In that configuration, the molecule is indeed potently poisonous, but it can instantly lose its toxicity when it’s broken down or complexed into something else. That’s the reason we have a cyanide-detoxifying enzyme in our bodies that does just that.2706 Cyanide is a common defense used by plants to fend off herbivores, so our bodies evolved not one—but five—different ways to get rid of it.2707

There is a rare genetic condition, though, called Leber’s disease, where you’re born without the ability to detoxify cyanide and can go blind drinking something like apple cider, for example. Other than that, our bodies evolved to be cyanide-detoxifying machines,2708 but there’s obviously a limit. There have been cases, for instance, of cyanide poisoning after bitter almond ingestion.2709 Regular almonds, the kind you buy at the store, produce about forty times less cyanide than bitter almonds,2710 which are used in flavor manufacturing. If you did manage to get your hands on some, though, eating fifty bitter almonds could kill you. So, doing the math, presumably eating two thousand regular almonds at one sitting would also not be a good idea.

You may not be able to readily buy bitter almonds, but you can easily get apricots, and the apricot kernels—the seeds inside the stone—have cyanide levels high enough to present a threat. So when it comes to the Swedish authorities, I am completely sympathetic to regulators wanting to take a precautionary approach, but are flaxseeds like bitter almonds, where just a few ounces could kill you, or are they more like regular almonds where typical dietary intake wouldn’t even come close to being harmful?

The claim from flax industry–funded scientists that we can eat literally pounds of ground flaxseeds a day without running into trouble is a back-of-the-envelope type of calculation based on the fact we can detoxify “up to 100 mg of cyanide/day.”2711 I’m not interested in how much we can detoxify “up to,” though. From a safety standpoint, you want to know about the worst-case scenario, not the best-case scenario. Can’t someone please just give people different doses of flaxseeds and simply measure how much cyanide ends up in their blood? Surprisingly, that wasn’t done until 2016.

Researchers finally put flaxseeds to the test under conditions expected to maximize cyanide exposure. They examined more than a dozen different sources of flaxseed and used the one with the single highest levels of cyanide they could find.2712 Making sure to use raw flaxseeds, since cooking often wipes out all the cyanide,2713 the researchers also used a 20,000 rpm laboratory grinder to ensure maximal mechanical breakdown to maximize absorption. They then gave the subjects a higher-than-typical dose, four and a half tablespoons, and had them eat it all at once on an empty stomach.2714 So what did they find?

The range of cyanide blood levels one could estimate to possibly be associated with clinical symptoms of intoxication might be around 20–40 micromoles.2715 Four and a half tablespoons of the highest cyanide-containing ultraground raw flaxseeds eaten on an empty stomach only raised average cyanide blood levels to 6 micromoles before rapidly coming back down, with the highest individual reading coming in at under 14.

There has to be some amount of flax that takes you over the limit, though, so the researchers tested nine tablespoons and then fifteen tablespoons. Nine tablespoons skirted blood levels right up to 20 micromoles, and fifteen tablespoons, practically a whole cup, put the study subject into the potential toxicity zone for more than three hours.2716 (So much for the industry’s claim that eight cups at a time are safe!2717) Yet even in that worse-case scenario of one cup of ultraground raw flaxseeds at the highest available cyanide concentration on an empty stomach, there still were no actual symptoms of toxicity.2718 This is consistent with the fact that there’s not a single published report of cyanide toxicity after consumption of flaxseeds anywhere in the medical literature, even in Swedish health spas, where individuals are given up to twelve tablespoons as a “fibre shock.”

Cumin Cuminium cyminum (este chimion la noi, nu chimen(carum carvi, Caraway))

Cumin

Used in cuisines around the world from Tex-Mex to South Asian, cumin is the second most popular spice on Earth after black pepper.2720 It is one of the oldest cultivated plants and has a range of purported medicinal uses, including appetite suppression,2721 but it wasn’t put to the test for weight loss until 2015. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial pitted cumin versus placebo versus the “fecal spotting” obesity drug orlistat. The cumin appeared to work as well as the drug, and they both beat out placebo, but only by a few pounds over the eight-week trial.2722 I’d take cumin over anal leakage any day, but rather than the whole spice, the researchers used two drops of cumin essential oil hidden in capsules three times a day, which is the equivalent of about two daily teaspoons of cumin.2723 A follow-up study sought to see how low in dosage they could go.

The next year, the same research team tried going down to as low as half a drop of cumin essential oil twice a day and still found a similar weight-loss benefit over placebo. However, the interpretation was complicated by the fact that they also added half a drop of lime essential oil.2724 A drop or two of cumin oil a day may also improve blood sugar control in diabetics,2725 but it’s so hard to trust the accuracy, safety, and purity of extracts and supplements.2726 What about just giving the whole spice—powdered cumin—readily available at any grocery store?

Overweight women were randomized to eat calorie-restricted weight-loss diets with or without a teaspoon of added cumin a day (half a teaspoon at both lunch and dinner). Over the three-month study, those in the cumin group lost about four more pounds and nearly an extra inch off their waists, in addition to significantly dropping their triglycerides and cholesterol.2727 Since cumin can be purchased in bulk for less than a dollar an ounce, a teaspoon would cost less than ten cents a day.


Black Cumin
Black cumin is not actually related to cumin; it’s a member of the buttercup rather than carrot family. Also known as Nigella sativa or simply “black seed,” it’s a common spice whose peppery flavor is popular in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines, but it’s also been prized for purported medicinal benefits. Described as a “miracle herb,”2728 with mentions going back to the Old Testament (Isaiah 28:25, 27), black cumin was found cached in King Tut’s tomb, and the Prophet Muhammad evidently is quoted as saying it could “heal every disease except death.”2729 Only in the last fifty years or so has it been put to the test, though, culminating in more than a thousand papers published in the medical literature.

Typical doses used in studies are just one or two grams a day, which is only about a quarter teaspoon.2730 This enables researchers to perform randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials by stuffing the whole-food spice into capsules rather than using just a component or extract.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have found that daily black cumin consumption significantly improves cholesterol, triglycerides,2731 blood pressure,2732 and blood sugar control.2733 Some of the results are quite extraordinary. For example, one study found that menopausal women randomized to a gram a day (less than a quarter teaspoon) of black cumin powder reduced their bad LDL cholesterol by 27 percent within two months.2734 That’s the kind of result you’d expect taking a statin drug, but it was achieved with just a sprinkle of a spice. Black cumin may also help with menopausal symptoms themselves.2735

Now, taking black cumin didn’t cure anything—a month after stopping the spice, cholesterol levels crept back up2736—but it does appear to be a cheap, safe, effective, and tasty (if you like spice) treatment for some of our deadliest risk factors. And the side effects? Loss of appetite and weight loss.2737 Bingo!

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled weight-loss trials found that about a quarter teaspoon of black cumin powder every day appears to reduce body mass index within a span of a couple of months.2738 If it’s truly so beneficial to so many facets of health, why don’t we hear more about it? Why wasn’t I taught about it in medical school? Maybe because there’s little profit motive. Black cumin is just a spice. The daily dose used in most of these studies would cost about three cents.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

In my Daily Dozen checklist of recommendations introduced in How Not to Die for fitting some of the healthiest of healthy foods into your daily routine, I already push flaxseeds and spices in general (though I focus on turmeric). For those interested in maximizing weight loss, try expanding your repertoire. Add cumin to hummus and baked beans. Why not enjoy a saffron-infused paella sprinkled with black cumin seeds? An easy way I include black cumin in my family’s daily diet is by simply mixing it in with the black peppercorns in the pepper grinder. If you aren’t familiar with my chia-based chocolate sauce strawberry dip recipe in How Not to Die, don’t miss out. It’s definitely a tastier alternative than nibbling on your chia pet.

Breakfast of Champions?

Of course, breakfast composition matters. Though a bagel,2762 cereal,2763 or eggs2764 may not sufficiently affect lunch intake, oatmeal might. Researchers at Columbia University randomized individuals into one of three breakfast conditions: oatmeal made from quick oats, the same number of calories of Frosted Flakes, or just plain water. They then measured how many calories people took in at lunch three hours later. Not only did those who ate the oatmeal feel significantly fuller and less hungry, some then went on to consume significantly less at lunch. Overweight participants who had eaten oatmeal for breakfast consumed less than half as many calories at lunch, about four hundred fewer calories, which is more than the oatmeal itself had contained.2765 So in effect, the oatmeal provided “negative” calories. In contrast, the Frosted Flakes was so unsatiating that the cereal group ate as much at lunch as the breakfast-skipping, water-only group.2766 It’s as if the cereal group hadn’t eaten breakfast at all!

Sadly, only about 6 percent of Americans are eating oatmeal on any given day.2767 Not only is oatmeal healthier, it’s cheaper too. Some high-end breakfast cereals price out closer to steaks than flakes at eight dollars a pound, whereas that same pound of rolled oats from your market’s bulk section may be less than a dollar (and would make ten servings).

A nutritional downside of skipping the morning meal is that breakfast may be the only time Americans consume any whole grains,2768 which are associated with a lower risk of dying prematurely from cancer, heart disease, and all causes put together.2769 A Harvard study following hundreds of thousands of individuals for more than a decade found that those consuming breakfast cereals tend to live longer, presumably because of their higher fiber intake (and perhaps fewer bacon-and-egg breakfasts),2770 though this benefit may be limited to whole-grain cereals.2771

And we know that children’s cereals are the worst. Breakfast cereals marketed to American kids have been found to contain 85 percent more sugar, 65 percent less fiber, and 60 percent more sodium than those marketed to adults.2772 Sugary cereals are the number one food advertised to kids,2773 with the average American child exposed to as many as 750 ads for cereal on TV every year.2774

Nutrients are added to breakfast cereals as a marketing gimmick in an attempt to create an aura of healthfulness.2775 Plastering nutrient claims on the box can create a “nutritional façade,” acting to distract attention away from unsavory qualities such as excess sugar content.2776 If those same nutrients were added to soda, would we feed our kids Coke for breakfast? We might as well spray cotton candy with vitamins too. As one medical journal editorial read, “Adding vitamins and minerals to sugary cereals … is worse than useless. The subtle message … is that it is safe to eat more.”2777 It’s been estimated that a child eating one serving per day of the average children’s cereal would consume more than ten pounds of sugar in a year, nearly a thousand spoonfuls of sugar, just from breakfast cereal alone.2778

General Mills argues it’s those spoonfuls of sugar that can help the medicine go down,2779 explaining that “if sugar is removed from bran cereal, it would have the consistency of sawdust.”2780 If sugar weren’t added, General Mills said its cereals could become “unpalatable.”2781 If you have to add sugar to a product to make it edible, maybe that should tell you something. A characteristic of so-called ultraprocessed foods is this necessity to pack them full of salt, sugar, flavorings, and the like since they have their natural intrinsic flavors processed out and you have to mask any unpleasant tastes introduced during manufacturing.2782

The president of the Cereal Institute has argued that without sugary cereals, kids might not eat breakfast at all,2783 similar to dairy industry arguments that removing chocolate milk from school cafeterias would risk kids skipping lunch.2784 He also stressed we must consider the alternatives.2785 As Kellogg’s director of nutrition once put it: “I would suggest that Fruit [sic] Loops as a snack are much better than potato chips or a sweet roll.”2786 You know there’s a problem when the only way to make your product look good is to compare it to Pringles and Cinnabon.

Like Night and Day
Mice are nocturnal creatures. They eat during the night and sleep during the day. If, however, you just feed mice during the day, they gain more weight than if you feed them a similar number of calories at night.2821 Same food and about the same amount of food, but different weight outcomes, suggesting that eating at the “wrong” time may lead to disproportionate weight gain. In humans, the wrong time would presumably mean eating at night.

Weight management recommendations often include advice to limit nighttime food consumption, but this was largely anecdotal since it wasn’t studied experimentally until 2013. Researchers instructed a group of young men not to eat after 7:00 p.m. for two weeks. Compared to a control period where they continued their regular habits, after the night-eating restriction, they ended up about two pounds lighter. This is not surprising, given dietary records showing they inadvertently ate fewer calories during that period.2822 To see if timing has metabolic effects beyond just foreclosing eating opportunities, you’d have to force people to eat the same amount of the same food, but just at different times of the day. The U.S. Army stepped forward to carry out just such an investigation.

In the first set of experiments, Army researchers had people eat a single meal a day, either within an hour of waking or after twelve hours of waking, so they each had just one meal as either breakfast or dinner. The breakfast-only group lost about two pounds a week compared to the dinner-only group.2823 As with the night-eating restriction study, this is to be expected, given that people tend to be hungrier in the evening. Think about it. If you went nine hours without eating during the day, you’d be famished, but people go nine hours overnight without a meal all the time yet don’t wake up ravenous. There is a natural circadian rhythm to hunger that peaks at about 8:00 p.m. and drops to its lowest level at around 8:00 a.m.2824 That may be why breakfast is typically the smallest meal of the day.

The circadian rhythms of our appetites aren’t just behavioral—they’re biological. It’s not just that we’re hungrier in the evening because we’ve been running around all day. If you stayed up all night and slept through the day, you’d still be hungriest when you woke up that evening. To untangle the factors, scientists use what’s called forced desynchrony protocols where they confine people in a room without windows in constant, unchanging, dim light and make them sleep in twenty- or twenty-eight-hour cycles to totally scramble them up.2825 This goes on for more than a week so the study subjects end up eating and sleeping at different times through all phases of the day. It’s then possible to see if the cyclical phenomenon is based on internal clocks or is just a consequence of what you happen to be doing at the time.

There’s a daily swing in our blood pressures, hormone production, digestion, immune activity, and almost everything else,2826 but let’s look at body temperature for an example. Our core body temperatures usually bottom out around 4:00 a.m., dropping from 98.6°F down to around 97.6°F.2827 Is this just because our bodies cool down as we’re sleeping? No. It can be shown experimentally that it happens at about the same time no matter what; it’s part of our circadian rhythms just like our appetites. It makes sense then that if you are only eating one meal a day and want to lose weight, you’d want to eat in the morning when your “hunger hormones” may be less active.2828

Okay, but then it just gets weirder.

The Army scientists repeated the experiment, but this time had the participants eat exactly two thousand calories, either for breakfast or dinner, taking appetite out of the equation. (They were also not allowed to exercise.) Same number of calories, so same change in weight, right? No, the breakfast-only group still lost about two pounds a week compared to the dinner-only group.2829 Two pounds of weight loss eating the same number of calories.


Breakfast Like a King, Lunch Like a Prince, Dine Like a Pauper

What about just shifting our daily distribution of calories to earlier in the day? Israeli researchers randomized overweight and obese women into one of two isocaloric groups, meaning each group was given the same number of total calories. One group was given a seven-hundred-calorie breakfast, a five-hundred-calorie lunch, and a two-hundred-calorie dinner, and the other group was given the opposite—two hundred for breakfast, five hundred for lunch, and seven hundred for dinner. Since they were all eating the same number of calories overall, the king-prince-pauper group should have lost the same amount of weight as the pauper-prince-king group, right? But no; the group who ate the most at breakfast lost more than twice as much weight as the group eating the most at the dinner meal. In addition to slimming nearly an extra two inches off their waistlines, by the end of the twelve-week study, the king-prince-pauper group lost nineteen pounds compared to only eight lost by the pauper-prince-king group despite eating the same number of calories.2830 Eleven additional pounds lost eating the same number of calories. That’s the power of chronobiology.

700/500/200 is 50 percent of calories at breakfast, 36 percent of calories at lunch, and only 14 percent at dinner. What about 20 percent of calories for dinner? How would a calorie percentage spread of 50/30/20 compare to eating 20 percent of calories at breakfast, 30 percent at lunch, and 50 percent at dinner? Again, the bigger-breakfast group experienced “dramatically increased” weight loss, about nine pounds difference in just eight weeks with no significant difference in overall caloric intake or physical activity between the groups.2831

Instead of eating more than 80 percent of calories at breakfast and lunch, what about just consuming 70 percent compared to 55 percent? Overweight homemakers were randomized to eat either 70 percent of their calories at breakfast, a morning snack, and lunch, leaving 30 percent for an afternoon snack and dinner, or a more balanced 55 percent up through and including lunch. In both cases, only a minority of calories was eaten for dinner. Would it matter if it were 55 percent of calories eaten up through lunch or 70 percent? Yes, there was significantly more weight loss and slimming in the dietary pattern that was more slanted toward the morning. The researchers concluded that one clear communication physicians could give is: “If you want to lose weight, eat more in the morning than in the evening.”2832

Simply telling people to eat their main meal at lunch rather than dinner may help. Despite comparable caloric intakes, participants in a weight-loss program randomized to get advice to make their main meal lunch beat out those who were instead told to make dinner their primary meal.2833 The evidence isn’t completely consistent, though. A review of meal pattern studies questioned the role that reducing evening intake would facilitate weight loss, citing a study that showed the evening-weighted group did better than the heavy-morning-meal group.2834 Perhaps that was because the morning meal group was given “chocolate, cookies, cake, ice cream, chocolate mousse or donuts” for breakfast.2835

Overall, the what is still more important than the when. Like each of the other Weight-Loss Boosters in part IV, you can use chronobiology to expedite weight loss, but caloric timing can’t substitute for a healthy diet. When he said there was “a time for every purpose under heaven,” Ecclesiastes probably wasn’t talking about donuts.


Burning the Morning Oil

Why do calories eaten in the morning seem to be less fattening than calories eaten in the evening? One reason is that more calories are burned off in the morning due to diet-induced thermogenesis, the amount of energy the body takes to digest and process a meal, given off in part as waste heat. When people are given the exact same meal in the morning, afternoon, and at night, their body uses up about 25 percent more calories to process the meal in the afternoon than at night and about 50 percent more calories to digest it in the morning.2836 That leaves fewer net calories in the morning to be stored as fat.

Let’s put some actual numbers to this. A group of Italian researchers randomized twenty people to eat the same standardized meal at either 8:00 a.m. or 8:00 p.m. After a week, the subjects returned, this time eating the same meal at the opposite time. So each person had a chance to eat the very same meal for breakfast and for dinner. After each meal, the subjects were placed in a “calorimeter” contraption to precisely measure how many calories they were burning over the next three hours. The researchers calculated that the meal given in the morning took about 300 calories to digest, whereas the exact same meal given at night used only about 200 calories to process. The meal itself was about 1,200 calories, so, when given in the morning, it ended up providing only about 900 calories compared to around 1,000 calories at night.2837 Same meal, same food, same amount of food, but effectively 100 fewer calories when consumed in the morning. So a calorie is not just a calorie. It depends on when it’s eaten.

But why do we burn more calories eating a morning meal? Is it behavioral or biological? If you started working the graveyard shift, sleeping during the day and working all night, which meal would net you fewer calories? Would it be the “breakfast” you had at night before you went to work, or the “dinner” you had in the morning before you went to bed? In other words, is there something about eating before we go to sleep that causes our bodies to hold on to more calories, or is it built into our circadian rhythms such that we store more calories at night regardless of what we’re doing? Harvard researchers decided to find out.

People were randomized to eat identical meals at 8:00 a.m. versus at 8:00 p.m. while under simulated night shifts or day shifts. Regardless of activity level or sleeping cycle, the calories burned while processing the morning meals were 50 percent higher than the evening meals.2838 So the difference is explained by chronobiology; it’s just part of our circadian rhythms to burn more meal calories in the morning.

How does it make sense for our bodies to race through calories in the morning when we have the whole day ahead of us? Perhaps our bodies aren’t so much wasting calories as investing them. When we eat in the morning, our bodies bulk up our muscles with glycogen, which is the primary energy reserve we use to fuel our muscles. That takes energy, though. In the evening, our bodies expect to be sleeping for much of the next twelve hours, so rather than storing blood sugar as extra glycogen in our muscles, the body preferentially uses it as an energy source, which may end up meaning we burn less of our body fat.2839 In the morning, however, our bodies expect to be running around all day, so instead of just burning off breakfast, our bodies continue to dip into our fat stores while we use breakfast calories to stuff our muscles full of the energy reserves we need to move around over the course of the day.

This is where the “inefficiency” may come from.2840 Why does it cost more calories to process a morning meal? Instead of just burning glucose (blood sugar) directly, our bodies are using up energy to string together glucose molecules into chains of glycogen in our muscles, which are then broken back down into glucose later in the day. That extra assembly/disassembly step takes energy, energy that our bodies take from the meal, leaving us with fewer calories.2841

So in the morning, our muscles are especially sensitive to insulin, rapidly pulling blood sugar out of our bloodstreams to build up glycogen reserves. At night, though, our muscles become relatively insulin-resistant and resist the signal to take in extra blood sugar. Does this mean we get higher blood sugar and insulin spikes in the evening compared to when we eat the exact same meal in the morning? Yes! In that hundred-calorie difference study, for example, blood sugars rose about twice as high after the 8:00 p.m. meal compared to the same meal eaten at 8:00 a.m.2842 So shifting the bulk of our caloric intake toward the morning would appear to have the dual benefit of more weight loss and better blood sugar control.


Time Heals Some Wounds

We’ve known for more than a half century that our bodies’ ability to keep blood sugars under control, known as glucose tolerance, declines as the day goes on.2843 If you hook yourself up to an IV and just steadily drip sugar water into your vein throughout the day, your blood sugars start to go up around 8:00 p.m. even though you haven’t eaten anything and the infusion rate didn’t change.2844 The same amount of sugar is going into your system every minute, but your ability to handle it deteriorates in the evening before bouncing right back again in the morning. A meal eaten at 8:00 p.m. can cause twice the blood sugar response as an identical meal eaten at 8:00 a.m.2845—as if we had eaten twice as much! Our bodies just aren’t expecting us to be eating when it’s dark outside. Our species may have only discovered how to make fire about a quarter million years ago.2846 We just weren’t built for twenty-four-hour diners.

One of the tests for diabetes is the glucose tolerance test, which measures how fast your body can clear sugar from the bloodstream. You drink a cup of water mixed with about four and a half tablespoons of regular corn syrup and then have your blood sugar measured two hours later. By that point, your blood sugar should be under 140 mg/dL. Between 140 and 199 is considered prediabetic, and 200 and higher is a sign of full-blown diabetes.2847 The circadian rhythm of glucose tolerance is so powerful that a person can test normal in the morning but prediabetic later in the day.2848 Prediabetics who average 163 at 7:00 a.m. test as frank diabetics by 7:00 p.m. at over 200.2849

In the Low Glycemic Load section, I talked about the importance of choosing lower-glycemic foods for weight loss. Timing is critical, though. Because of our circadian pattern of glucose tolerance,2850 eating a low-glycemic food at night can cause a higher blood sugar spike than consuming a high-glycemic food in the morning. We’re so metabolically crippled at night that researchers found that eating a bowl of All-Bran at 8:00 p.m. caused as high a blood sugar spike as eating Rice Krispies at 8:00 a.m.2851 High-glycemic foods at night would seem to represent the worst-case scenario.2852 So if you can’t resist eating refined grains and sugary junk, they might be less detrimental in the morning.2853

This drop in glucose tolerance over the day may help explain the weight-loss benefits of frontloading calories toward the beginning of the day beyond just the diet-induced thermogenesis effects.2854 Simply eating an earlier, rather than later, lunch may make a difference. People randomized to eat a large lunch at 4:30 p.m. suffered a 46 percent greater blood sugar response compared to an identical meal eaten just a few hours earlier at 1:00 p.m.2855 Breakfast versus lunch also seems to make a difference. A meal eaten at 7:00 a.m. can cause 37 percent lower blood sugars than an identical meal taken at 1:00 p.m.2856 There doesn’t seem to be any difference between a meal at 8:00 p.m. and one at midnight,2857 but eating that late can disrupt our circadian rhythms so much that it can mess up our metabolisms the next morning, resulting in significantly higher blood sugars after breakfast.2858

The revelations of chronobiology bring the breakfast debate full circle. Skipping breakfast not only generally fails to cause weight loss, but it worsens overall daily blood sugar control in both diabetic2859 and nondiabetic individuals.2860 This may explain why those who skip breakfast appear to be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the first place.2861

Breakfast skippers also tend to have higher rates of heart disease2862 and atherosclerosis in general.2863 Is this just because skipping breakfast tends to cluster with other unhealthy choices, such as smoking and sicklier eating habits overall?2864 The link between skipping breakfast and heart disease—even premature death in general2865—seems to survive attempts to control for these confounding factors, but you don’t really know until you put it to the test.

Does skipping breakfast lead to higher cholesterol, for example? Yes, within just two weeks, there was a significant rise in bad LDL cholesterol in those randomized to skip breakfast.2866 The Israeli 700/500/200 study found that the triglycerides of the king-prince-pauper group got significantly better, dropping 60 points, while those of the pauper-prince-king group got significantly worse, rising 26 points.2867

So consuming more calories in the morning relative to the evening may actually have the triple benefit of more weight loss, better blood sugar control, and lower heart disease risk.

****************************************************************************************************
Chronodisruption

One of the most important breakthroughs in recent years has been the discovery of peripheral clocks.2868 We’ve known about the central clock, the so-called suprachiasmatic nucleus, for nearly a half century.2869 It sits in the middle of our brains right above where our optic nerves cross, allowing it to respond to night and day. We now know there are semiautonomous clocks in nearly every organ of our bodies.2870 Our hearts run on a clock, our lungs run on a clock, our kidneys run on a clock. Up to 80 percent of the genes in our livers are expressed in a circadian rhythm,2871 and our entire digestive tracts are too.

The rate at which our stomachs empty, the secretion of digestive enzymes, and the expression of transporters in our intestinal linings for absorbing sugar and fat—these all cycle around the clock. So, too, does the ability of our body fat to sop up extra calories.2872 The way we know these cycles are driven by local clocks rather than being controlled by our brains is that we can take surgical biopsies of fat, put them in a petri dish, and still observe their natural rhythm.2873

All this clock talk is not just biological curiosity. Our health may depend on keeping these clocks in sync. Think of it like a child playing on a swing. Imagine you’re pushing the child, but become distracted by other goings-on in the playground. You stop paying attention to your timing, so you push too early, push too late, or forget to push altogether. What happens? Out of sync, the swinging becomes erratic, slows, or even stops. That is what happens when we travel across multiple time zones or have to work the night shift.2874

The pusher in this case is the light cue falling on our eyes. Our circadian rhythms are meant to get a bright light push every morning at dawn, but if the sun rises at a different time or we’re exposed to bright light in the middle of the night, this can push our cycles out of sync and leave us feeling out of sorts. That’s an example of a mismatch between the external environment and our central clocks. Problems can also arise from a misalignment between the central clock in our brains with all the other organ clocks throughout our bodies. An extreme illustration of this is a remarkable set of experiments suggesting even our poop can get jet lag.

Our microbiomes seem to have their own circadian rhythms. Even though our friendly flora are down where the sun don’t shine, there’s a daily oscillation in both bacterial abundance and activity in our colons.

Check this out: If you put people on a plane and fly them halfway around the world, then feed their poop to mice, those mice grow fatter than mice fed their preflight feces.2875 Though it may have just been bad airline food or something, the researchers suggest the fattening flora were a consequence of circadian misalignment.2876 Indeed, several lines of evidence now implicate chronodisruption—the state in which our central and peripheral clocks diverge out of sync—as playing a role in conditions ranging from premature aging and cancer2877 to mood disorders and obesity.2878

Bright light exposure is the synchronizing swing-pusher for our central clocks. What helps drive our internal organ clocks that aren’t exposed to daylight? Food intake.2879 That’s why the timing of our meals may be so important. Removing all external timing cues by locking people away under constant, dim light, researchers showed you could effectively decouple central from peripheral rhythms just by shifting mealtimes. They took blood draws every hour and even took biopsies of the subjects’ fat every six hours to demonstrate the resulting metabolic disarray.2880

Just as morning light can help sync our central clocks, morning meals can help sync our peripheral clocks. Skipping breakfast disrupts the normal expression and rhythm of the clock genes themselves, which coincide with the adverse metabolic effects.2881 Thankfully, much of this can be reversed. Take a group of habitual breakfast skippers and have them eat meals at 8:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m., and their cholesterol and triglycerides improve compared to taking those three meals five hours later, at 1:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m., and 11:00 p.m.2882 There’s a circadian rhythm to cholesterol synthesis in the body as well, which is also strongly influenced by food intake, as evidenced by the fact that cholesterol production drops 95 percent in response to a single day of fasting.

Working Against the Clock

Night-shift workers have higher rates of obesity, as well as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer2884—graveyard shift indeed!—but is it because they tend to eat out of vending machines or simply because they don’t get enough sleep? Highly controlled studies have attempted recently to tease out these factors by putting people on the same diets with the same sleep, but at the wrong time of day.2885 Redistributing eating to the nighttime not only resulted in elevated blood pressure, inflammation, and cholesterol,2886,2887,2888 but shifting meals to the evening in a simulated night-shift protocol turned about one-third of the subjects effectively prediabetic in only ten days.2889 Our bodies just weren’t designed to handle food at night.2890

Just as avoiding bright light at night can prevent circadian misalignment, so can avoiding eating at night. We may have no control over the lighting at our workplaces, but we can try to minimize overnight food intake, which has been shown to help limit the negative metabolic consequences of shift work.2891 When we do finally get home in the morning, though, we may disproportionately crave unhealthy foods. In one experiment, 81 percent of participants in a night-shift scenario chose high-fat foods such as croissants off a breakfast buffet, compared to just 43 percent of the same subjects during a control period on a normal schedule.2892

Shift work may leave people too fatigued to exercise, but even at the same physical activity levels, chronodisruption can affect energy expenditure. Researchers at the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at the University of Colorado found that we burn 12–16 percent fewer calories while sleeping during the daytime compared to at night.2893 Just a single improperly timed snack can affect how much fat we burn every day. Study subjects eating a specified snack at 10:00 a.m. burned about six more grams of fat from their bodies than on the days they ate the same snack at 11:00 p.m.2894 While that’s only about a pat and half of butter’s worth,2895 it’s astounding that eating an identical snack just given at a different time can make such a difference. What’s more, the evening snack group also suffered about a 9 percent bump in their LDL cholesterol within two weeks.

Keeping Yourself in the Dark

If weakening our circadian rhythms can cause weight gain, might strengthening them facilitate weight loss? Regular morning meals can give our circadian cycles a little daily push,2908 but the biggest shove comes from our exposure to bright midmorning light (8:00 a.m.–11:00 a.m.). Similarly, exposure to light at night would be analogous to nighttime eating.2909 Yes, we’ve had candles to illuminate the darkness for five thousand years, but flames from candles, campfires, and oil lamps are skewed toward the red end of the light spectrum, and the shorter blue wavelengths are the ones that specially set our circadian clocks. Even incandescent electric lighting, which only started a little over a century ago, consisted of mainly low-level yellow wavelengths, but they’ve been replaced over just the last few decades with fluorescents and LED lights that now contain extra blue wavelengths,2910 which are more similar to morning sunlight.2911

Using wrist meters to measure ambient light exposure, researchers found that increased evening and nighttime light exposure correlated with a subsequent increased risk of developing obesity over time.2912 This was presumed to be due to circadian misalignment, but is it possible it may instead be a sign they’re not sleeping as much, and that’s the real reason they grew heavier?

A study of more than one hundred thousand women controlled for this and found that the odds of obesity trended with higher nighttime light exposure independent of sleep duration.2913 Compared to women who reported their bedrooms at night were either too dark to see their hands in front of their faces or at least too dark to see across the room, those who reported it was light enough to see across their bedrooms were significantly heavier on average.2914 And it isn’t as though they were sleeping with night-lights. Without blackout curtains on the windows, many neighborhoods may be bright enough to cause circadian disruption. Using satellite imagery, scientists have even been able to correlate higher obesity rates with brighter communities.2915 There’s so much light at night these days that, outside of a blackout, the only Milky Way many of our children will likely ever see is inside a candy wrapper.

Winter Never Comes

SAD doesn’t just stand for the Standard American Diet. There’s a condition known as seasonal affective disorder that’s characterized by increased appetite and cravings, along with increased sleepiness and lethargy, beginning in autumn when light exposure starts to dwindle. This now appears to simply represent the far end of a normal spectrum of human behavior. We all appear to eat more as the days get shorter. There is a marked seasonal rhythm to caloric intake, with greater meal size, eating rate, hunger, and overall caloric consumption in the fall.2925

During the winter, some animals hibernate and, in preparation, double their fat stores with autumn’s abundance to deal with the subsequent scarcity of winter.2926 Genes have been identified in humans that are similar to hibernation genes,2927 which may help explain why we exhibit some of the same behaviors. The autumnal effect isn’t subtle. Researchers have calculated an average difference of 222 calories per day between caloric intake in the fall versus spring, and this isn’t just because it’s colder, since we eat more in the fall than the winter.2928 It appears we are just genetically programmed to prep for the deprivation of winter that no longer comes.

It’s remarkable in this day and age of modern lighting and heating that our bodies would still pick up on the environmental cues of the changing seasons enough to affect such a major influence on our eating patterns. Unsurprisingly, bright light therapy is used to treat seasonal affective disorder, nearly tripling the likelihood of remission compared to placebo.2929 Though it’s never been tested directly, it can’t hurt to take the dog for some extra morning walks each fall to help fend off some of the coming holiday season weight gain.

EATING RATE

A Solid Grip on Satiety
As I discussed in the Rich in Fruits and Vegetables section, the human body doesn’t seem to register calories from liquids as well as it does calories from solid foods for some reason. Take, for example, the famous study of soda versus jelly beans. Researchers had people add twenty-eight extra spoonfuls of sugar to their daily diets in the form of jelly beans or soda and then measured how many calories the study participants ate over the rest of the day to see if their bodies would compensate for all that extra sugar. In the jelly bean group, their bodies registered the extra calories from the handfuls of candy, and the subjects ended up eating less of everything else throughout the day. In the end, they ate pretty much the same number of calories before and after adding the jelly beans to their diets. In the soda group, however, despite all the added calories from the cans of pop they drank every day, they continued to eat about the same amount of the rest of their diets. No wonder they gained weight after a month of drinking soda.2963 Their bodies didn’t seem to fully recognize the extra calories when they were in liquid form and, therefore, didn’t compensate by reducing their appetites for the rest of the day. Of course, when it comes to deciding which is a better dietary choice—soda versus jelly beans—the answer is neither. When I encourage people to eat beans every day, I’m decidedly not talking about the Jelly Belly variety.

What about solid-versus-liquid healthy foods? What if you drink a smoothie for breakfast instead of eating a solid meal? Will your body mistakenly think you effectively skipped breakfast and lead you to eat more later in the day? To answer this, we first have to make sure this solid-versus-liquid-calorie effect is real. Soda and jelly beans don’t just differ by physical form; they have different ingredients.

To truly test for a solid-versus-liquid effect, you’d have to use the exact same foods in two different forms. Finally, a study did just that. Researchers looked at what happens if you eat a fruit salad of raw apples, apricots, and bananas and drink three cups of water or, instead, blend the fruit with two cups of water to make a smoothie and drink the third cup of water.2964 The meals are identical except one is in solid form and the other is in smoothie form. What happened? People felt significantly less full after the smoothie, even though it was the same type and amount of food. In smoothie form, it didn’t fill people up as much as eating fruit au naturel.

Originally, we thought it was due to the lack of chewing. The act of chewing itself may send “I’ve eaten enough” signals that you don’t get just by drinking.2965 In one experiment, people were asked to eat pasta, chewing either ten or thirty-five times per mouthful, until they felt comfortably full.2966 Those who chewed thirty-five times per bite ended up eating about a third of a cup less pasta than those who had only chewed ten times per bite. So there we have it: not only proof of a solid-versus-liquid effect from the smoothie study but the actual mechanism. As so often happens in science, however, just when you think everything is neatly wrapped up with a bow, a paradox arises.


The Great Soup Paradox

Puréed, blended soup—essentially a warm smoothie of blended vegetables—was sometimes found to be more satiating than the same veggies in solid form.2967 Since the meal in liquid form was more filling than the same meal in solid form, it can’t be due to the amount of chewing. How can cold smoothies be less filling than the constituent ingredients eaten in solid form, but warm smoothies are more filling? So filling, in fact, that when people have soup as a first course, they may end up eating so much less of the main course that they eat fewer calories overall, even when the added soup calories are taken into account.2968 How can we explain this paradox?

Might puréed fruits be less filling than solid fruits, but puréed vegetables more filling than solid vegetables? To test this, Purdue University researchers gave subjects three apples to eat, three cups of apple juice to drink, or a warm, blended apple soup made from a cup of apple juice with two cups of applesauce liquefied in a blender and heated up. Within fifteen minutes of eating the three actual apples, the subjects reported feeling pretty full. Drinking three cups of apple juice, on the other hand, didn’t cut hunger much at all. What about the apple soup, which was pretty much just apple juice mixed with applesauce and warmed? The apple soup cut hunger almost as much as the whole apples, even more than an hour later, and in fact beat out whole apples for decreasing overall caloric intake for the day.2969

What’s so special about soup? What does eating soup have in common with prolonged chewing that differentiates it from drinking a smoothie? Time. It took people about twice as long to eat when they chewed each bite of pasta thirty-five times rather than ten in that previous study.2970 Now think about how long it takes to eat a bowl of soup compared to drinking a smoothie. Could eating more slowly reduce caloric intake?

Alternatively, maybe we just think of soup as a filling food so the added satiety is more like a placebo effect. Feelings like hunger and fullness are subjective. People tend to report hunger more in accordance with how many calories they think something has rather than the actual caloric content.2971 Remember that movie Memento about a guy who can’t form short-term memories? That’s actually a real disorder in which people can’t remember what had just happened more than a few moments earlier. Tragically, sufferers of anterograde amnesia can overeat to the point of vomiting because they forgot they had just eaten, which shows what poor judges we are of our own hunger.2972

The effects of thoughts about foods can extend beyond the subjective. In a famous study entitled “Mind Over Milkshakes,” people were offered two different shakes: one described as indulgent, “decadence you deserve,” and another labeled as sensible, “guilt-free satisfaction.” People had different hormonal responses to the two options even though they were being fooled and given the exact same milkshake.2973 Just the thought of them being different was enough to affect how their bodies responded based on objective blood tests.

Or could it be as simple as soup is most often served hot and warmer foods are more satiating?2974 How could we figure out if the answer to the soup paradox was time, thought, or temperature? If only that blended fruit salad and water study had a third group in which the smoothie was just eaten cold out of a bowl with a spoon. That would solve the mystery. If it were just preconceived notions about the comforts of soup or its warmth, then fullness ratings would fall down around that of the smoothie. It turns out that the study did include just such a third group, and the participants felt just as full sipping the smoothie with a spoon as they did eating the whole fruit—so the answer is time.2975 The only real reason smoothies aren’t as filling is that we gulp them down. If we sip them slowly over time, they can be just as filling as if we had eaten the fruits and veggies whole.

The Twenty-Minute Rule

Schoolchildren have been timed consuming lunch in an average of seven to ten minutes.2976 Children are often scolded not to wolf down their food, but does it really matter how fast we eat? More than you may realize. People were given soup, but half were given small spoons and told to eat slowly, and the other half were given big spoons and told to eat quickly, and an amazing thing happened: The slow-eating group not only ended up feeling more satiated, but they did so after eating less soup.2977 They felt fuller eating less food.

Prolonged meal duration can allow more time for our bodies’ own “I’m full” satiety signals to develop before too many calories have been consumed.2978 The slower we eat, the more time our bodies have to catch up. As Harvard’s Healthy Weight Checklist puts it: “Slowing down at meals … can help avoid overeating by giving the brain time to tell the stomach when it’s had enough food.”2979 We evolved for millions of years trying to extract calories from undomesticated fruits and vegetables, which were much tougher and fibrous than produce today. This was long before hot dog–eating contests enabled the human frame to inhale twenty thousand calories in ten minutes.2980 Our bodies are built to expect us to take our time when eating.

When we eat, anorexigenic hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY, which I discussed in the High in Fiber-Rich Foods section, are released from cells lining our intestines into our bloodstreams. These hormones then have to travel to our brains to flick on the satiety switch to get us to slow down, but this process takes time. Preload studies, where people are fed a first course one, five, fifteen, twenty, thirty, or sixty minutes before the main meal, show that this fullness feedback loop may take about twenty minutes to fully tamp down our appetites.2981 This, then, explains the soup study results. The fast-soup-eating group was done in fewer than nine minutes, while the slow-soup-eating group stopped after twenty-nine minutes.2982 Even though the group eating more slowly and with smaller spoons ended up having less soup overall, their brains had time to fully process the meal and were able to give them a stronger sense of satiety.

In smoothie form, you can drink fruits and vegetables at about two cups a minute—ten times faster than it might take to eat fruits and vegetables in solid form.2983 Liquid calories can be consumed so quickly they can undermine our bodies’ ability to regulate food intake at healthy levels. It’s not the liquid texture per se but the high rate of consumption at which liquids are normally consumed. Blend all the smoothies you want, but sip them slowly for a half hour or so rather than gulping them down.

Every one of a dozen population studies found that those who eat faster are at higher risk of obesity, approximately doubling their odds.2984 In a behavioral treatment program for obesity, those who were able to slow their average meal length by just four minutes, from fourteen to eighteen minutes, lost more weight over a seven-month period.2985 There are lots of ways to extend meal duration, like putting down your utensil between bites, chewing longer, taking smaller bites, or choosing foods that simply take longer to eat.

Merely inserting enforced breaks while eating doesn’t appear to work, however. One experiment in which people were interrupted with a buzzer every minute or so and asked to pause eating for up to sixty seconds ended up eating more,2986 seemingly out of sheer frustration.2987 Prolonged chewing shows more promise.

Chewing the Fat Away

An obituary from 1919 about health food enthusiast Horace Fletcher proclaimed that he “taught the world to chew.”2988 Also known as the Great Masticator, Fletcher was a health reformer who popularized the idea of chewing each mouthful more than thirty-two times, a chew for every tooth.2989 That practice wasn’t put to the test until nearly a century later in that pasta study when chewing a bite thirty-five times was shown to beat out chewing only ten times and resulted in 12 percent fewer calories eaten at a meal.2990 A similar study found a similar result, comparing forty versus fifteen chews.2991 This is not surprising given the twenty-minute rule—the fewer-chews group finished in fifteen minutes, whereas the greater-chews group took nearly a half hour before they felt satisfied, allowing their natural satiety feedback loop time to kick in. The investigators concluded that public health messages to promote “slower eating” are vague, whereas a recommendation to chew food more thoroughly may be more actionable advice.2992

Do people who chew less weigh more? One study sent people home with a chew-recording device—a headband with electrodes placed over their jaw muscles—and found that those scoring fewer chews had up to nine times the odds of gaining more than twenty pounds over the subsequent decades.2993 Of course, the obvious confounding factor to how they were eating was what they eating. Maybe the high-chew group gained less weight because they were eating lots of fiber-rich foods like vegetables, while the low-chew group was slurping down more calories from Slurpees. Eating an apple may take an average of 186 chews, whereas the same weight in Jell-O may only take 23.2994

If you seat people in a room and watch them eat the same food, overweight and obese individuals do seem to chew fewer times per mouthful than those who are normal weight, resulting in a faster eating rate.2995 If you ask people to double their baseline number of chews per bite, they end up eating about 15 percent less pizza, feeling just as full eating more than one hundred fewer calories.2996 Even just asking them to chew 50 percent more times than normal may cut their consumption by nearly 10 percent.2997

More thorough chewing leads to a slower eating rate, which leads to fewer calories consumed.2998 In other words, the same fullness with less food. If you have people eat the same amount but chew more, they end up less hungry,2999 but does that appetite suppression translate into less food eaten hours later? Researchers gave people a fixed amount for lunch and told some to chew as they normally would and the others to chew each bite for thirty seconds. Later that afternoon, the subjects were presented with a snack (essentially Skittles and M&M’s) and those who, hours earlier, had chewed each mouthful of lunch for thirty seconds ended up eating only half as much candy.3000

But just when we think we have the mechanism figured out, a new enigma arises. The candy study also involved a third group instructed to chew lunch normally but with a ten-second break between each mouthful, which resulted in approximately the same meal duration as the chew-each-bite-for-thirty-seconds group. So the same slowed eating rate would presumably result in the same drop in snack intake hours later, right? No. Only the prolonged-chewing group sufficiently suppressed appetites enough to significantly cut down on snack intake later on, even though both of the slowed eating groups ate lunch over about the same protracted period.3001 There must be more to the story than just allowing time for our brains to recognize the release in satiety hormones from the digestive tract.


Oral Stimulation

The cephalic phase of digestion starts before food even hits our stomachs. Cephalic means in the head. There are nerves traveling straight from our brains to our mouths. This is how even the thought of food can get us salivating. And the nerves are a two-way street. Signals coming from our mouths can tip off our brains to what’s coming down the pike.3002

To test the effect of this mind-to-mouth connection on appetite, you can insert a tube down someone’s throat to compare regular eating to slipping the same amount of food directly into their stomachs. Removing the experience of the taste, smell, and texture of the food left people feeling significantly less full even though they ended up with the exact same amount of food in their stomachs.3003 This wasn’t just a psychological effect. Objective measures, such as slowed stomach emptying times, prove that sensations from the mouth translate into physical fullness.3004

Another way to study the cephalic phase response is to use sham feeding, known less delicately as the chew-and-spit technique. The insulin levels in our blood can be doubled within fifteen minutes just by chewing on some pizza, even though none of it is swallowed.3005 Based on the signals coming from the mouth, our brains seem to anticipate how much insulin is going to be needed to handle the incoming load and try to get a head start. Incidentally, the mismatch between the sweetness on the tongue and the lack of calories flooding in when drinking diet soda may actually help explain some of the metabolic disruption associated with the consumption of artificial sweeteners.3006

In regard to appetite control, the cephalic phase response can be so powerful that fake eating can even trump actual eating. Consider this ingenious study: Subjects were split into two groups—one who chewed and spat out cake for one minute, and another who chewed and spat out cake for eight minutes, the “long oral stimulation” group. Meanwhile, within each group, half had about one hundred calories of “cake-solution” pumped into their stomachs with a tube and the other half had eight hundred calories pumped in. Then, thirty minutes later, everyone was offered a meal to see what effect each manipulation had on appetite. Remarkably, the long-chewing group getting the smaller, hundred-calorie preload ate less than the short-chewing group getting the larger, eight-hundred-calorie preload.3007 So eight times the oral exposure more mightily tamped down their hunger than getting eight times more actual food in the stomach. Amazing!

You can see how the cephalic phase response would work in concert with the digestive hormone feedback loop. It would take the average person about twenty minutes to eat nine cups of apple slices, whereas drinking the same number of calories of apple juice would take less than two minutes.3008,3009,3010 Not only would that twenty minutes allow time for our “stop-eating” hormones to make it up to our brains, but the apples offer eighteen more minutes of oral exposure and ten times the number of oral-stimulation signals racing from the mouth to the brain, letting it know we’re chowing down.

Bite-Sized

How could you design an experiment to differentiate among prolonged chewing, oral exposure, and meal duration? A research group in the Netherlands came up with an elegant solution. They had people effectively take either a teaspoon of tomato soup every five seconds or a tablespoonful every fifteen seconds until they were full. Because a tablespoon is three times bigger than a teaspoon, the eating rate was exactly the same at a quarter cup per minute. Note, though, the oral exposure time was completely different. Even though the tablespoon of soup lasted slightly longer in the mouth (three seconds versus two seconds with the teaspoonful), because the tablespoon group was only getting four spoonfuls a minute, the total oral exposure time every minute was only half that of the teaspoon group (twelve seconds versus twenty-four seconds). So it was the same eating rate, but the soup was only in the mouths of the tablespoon group one-fifth of the time and in the mouths of the teaspoon group nearly half the time.3018 Who ended up eating more soup?

If chewing were the critical factor, then both groups would have presumably eaten the same amount of soup since there was no chewing in either group. (It was creamy tomato.) Similarly, since their stomachs were filling up at the same rate, if it were just the length of the meal, then both groups would get full around the same time. But if the results came down to the amount of time food is physically in our mouths, then the teaspoon group would get fuller faster and end up eating significantly less—and that’s exactly what happened. The teaspoon group felt full after about four minutes, but the tablespoon group ate for closer to six minutes and ended up consuming a third more soup.3019

The same thing happens when you replicate this experiment with drinks. Researchers had people swallow teaspoon-sized sips of orangeade every other second versus a larger four-teaspoon swallow every eight seconds. Same minute-by-minute drink rate, but twice the oral exposure in the teaspoon-sip group. Again, the smaller-sip group won out, feeling satiated after about one-and-a-half cups compared to the two cups it took when taking larger sips.3020 Experiments simultaneously varying bite size and oral exposure time with solid food found the same phenomenon: It’s better to nibble and savor than chomp and gulp.


****************************************************************************************************
Hard Feelings

We’ve talked about some of the ways to increase the time food stays in our mouths so we can take better advantage of the cephalic phase response. Whatever you’re eating, you can take smaller bites, eat slower, or chew longer. Another strategy is to choose different foods entirely. The texture of foods can make a difference. By default, harder foods are consumed in smaller bites, eaten more slowly, and with longer chewing. If you feed people a soft rice salad made with creamy risotto rice and boiled vegetables, they end up eating 17 percent more calories than when given the same salad made with regular rice and raw vegetables. Even just swapping a hard hamburger bun for a soft one can make a difference.3053 However, this is the opposite of what Big Food tends to dish us. The food industry processes products for maximum consumption rate.3054 They don’t call it fast food for nothing.

People overeat more liquid yogurt when presented with a straw versus a spoon because we can gulp faster than we can spoon.3055 For the same reason, if people are given chocolate milk versus pudding made from nearly identical ingredients but fine-tuned with different thickeners to change the physical state, they will consume more of the liquid than the semisolid food. If the eating speed is standardized, though—for example, if the products are pumped directly into their mouths at the same rate—people can end up feeling just as full either way.3056 Some studies still suggest a satiety benefit of more solid foods, however, even at the same rate of consumption.3057 This may be due in part to differences in stomach-emptying rates.

If you put people in an MRI machine to measure how quickly food is draining from their stomachs, you can see that thicker foods tend to drain more slowly. In fact, one hundred calories of a thick milkshake can end up being more satiating than five hundred calories of a thin shake.3058 Presented with thick or thin porridge, people feel just as satisfied eating about fifty fewer calories of the thick porridge.3059 So, when making oatmeal, remember that thicker and chewier may be more filling.

Adding dried fruits and nuts can create textural complexity, which has also been found to suppress appetite, based on studies of retro Jell-O salad–like concoctions that mixed in layers of chewy and crunchy bits. The appetite-lowering benefits over more homogenous foodstuffs are thought to be due to enhanced oral-sensory stimulation.


The Time-Calorie Displacement Program

Whether through increasing viscosity or the number of chews, or decreasing bite size and eating rate, dozens of studies have demonstrated that regardless of how we boost the amount of time food is in our mouths, it can result in lower caloric intake.3061 Some approaches may be more viable than others. For example, in that study where people had to chew each mouthful for thirty seconds before swallowing, they went on to eat less candy hours later—but they weren’t happy about it. The prolonged-chewing group reported enjoying their meal significantly less,3062 calling long-term amenability into question.3063 My favorite method for increasing oral exposure time is to choose healthier foods.

As opposed to those made in a factory, foods that grow tend to be slow. Thanks in part to the fiber content of whole, healthy plant foods, the default eating rate of more healthful foods just tends to be slower naturally.3064 Though there are certainly exceptions, like caramel toffee, highly processed foods tend to be consumed quicker. There can be a hundredfold difference in consumption between the fastest and the slowest foods. You could consume an entire two-thousand-daily-calorie-allotment’s worth of chocolate milk in four minutes, whereas it would take more than six straight hours to chew through that many raw carrots.3065,3066,3067

Even healthy foods can vary drastically. The average eating rate of boiled carrots is ten times that of raw.3068 This is not to say cooked carrots aren’t super healthy, but the longer something takes to eat, the more time those hunger-squashing hormones have to reach your brain and the more direct mouth-brain nerve stimulation there will be to quell your appetite. So, from a weight-loss standpoint, raw carrots clearly beat out boiled.

Directing people toward more slow-food options was formalized into a weight-loss program known as Time-Calorie Displacement, also known as Time-Energy Displacement, which sounds like a contraption that belongs in a DeLorean. In the Low in Calorie Density section, I talked about how whole plant foods tend to offer a much greater volume of food for the same number of calories, and more food takes longer to eat, so in effect, healthier foods can often displace less healthy options in both time and space. A greater quantity of food doesn’t just physically fill you up more. All that extra eating can allow other satiety mechanisms beyond just stomach-distension time to kick in.

When people were put on a diet packed with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and allowed to eat all they wanted, they ended up eating 48 percent fewer calories than they might have otherwise.3069 Part of that was due to the lower calorie density of the plant-heavy diet, but people also spent about 40 percent more time chewing, for seventeen minutes per meal compared to twelve minutes. It’s one thing for people to feel just as full on half the calories, but can they be kept satisfied on a thousand-calorie diet if they’re eating enough whole plant foods? That’s what the Time-Calorie Displacement diet was all about.3070

Thousands of people went through the official Time-Calorie Displacement Program3071 (since renamed the EatRight program).3072 The weight loss of participants averaged eighteen pounds over six months of active treatment, and body fat was lost while muscle mass was maintained. The critical question, though, is what happened after that? Over an average follow-up of seventeen months post-treatment, 44 percent of patients continued to lose weight, and more than 90 percent stayed under their baseline weights.3073 In designing the diet, the researchers recognized that nearly any diet can cause weight loss at least short term, but the ends don’t always justify the means. Their challenge was to design a “nutritionally sound” diet “conducive to a lifelong pattern of healthful eating.”3074 To that end, the diet encourages people to eat more high-bulk, calorie-dilute foods (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans) and fewer energy-dense foods (meats, cheeses, sugars, and fats).3075

In The Journal of the American College of Nutrition, a review article was published entitled “Rational Weight Loss Programs: A Clinician’s Guide.” The Time-Calorie Displacement Program was held up as a prototypical example: safe, effective, health-promoting, and based on sound scientific principles.

EXERCISE TWEAKS

The Exercise “Myth”

When trying to lose weight, which is more important: diet or exercise? A national survey found that a “vast majority” of Americans, seven out of ten, believe that food and beverage consumption and physical activity are equally important when it comes to weight loss. About two out of ten favored exercise, and only about one in ten chose diet.3080 The vast majority of Americans are wrong.

It’s easy to understand how people might think diet and exercise play equal roles. After all, our body fat is determined by the balance of calories in and calories out. What people may not understand about this energy-balance equation is that we have much more power over the calories-in side. In fact, on a day-to-day basis, we have full control. We could choose to eat zero calories or ten thousand calories. Most of the calories out, however, tend to be outside our control.

Wild animals typically burn most of their calories on activity,3081 but thanks in part to our energy-intensive brains, most of our daily calories are used just to keep us alive.3082 Even if we stayed in bed all day, we’d still burn more than a thousand calories just to fuel our resting metabolic rates—the basics like thinking, breathing, and keeping our hearts pumping. In contrast, even most “active” people exercise less than two hours a week, which may average out to fewer than one hundred calories burned off daily.3083 That’s less than 5 percent of the calories-out side of the equation.3084 Given that, the two thousand calories we may take in every day can exert twenty times more influence than exercise over our weight destiny.

Though most people believe exercise is a “very effective” way to lose weight,3085 that has been referred to as a “myth” in the scientific literature.3086 In fact, it’s been labeled as one of the most common misconceptions in the field of obesity,3087 yet virtually all formal weight-loss guidelines include some sort of exercise recommendation.3088 What does the science say?

Population studies certainly have found strong correlations between physical inactivity and obesity, but does a sedentary lifestyle lead to obesity, or does obesity lead to a sedentary lifestyle? It probably works a little in both directions.3089 To prove cause and effect and also to quantify the relationship, you really have to put it to the test.


Can You Outrun a Bad Diet?

Dozens of randomized controlled trials involving thousands of participants have been published on the effects of exercise on weight loss.3090 How did exercise fare? Surprisingly, physical activity was not found to be an effective strategy.3091 Think of it this way: A moderately obese person doing moderate-intensity physical activity, like biking or very brisk walking, would burn off approximately 350 calories an hour.3092 Most drinks, snacks, and other processed junk are consumed at a rate of about 70 calories a minute. Therefore, it only takes five minutes of snacking for someone to wipe out a whole hour of exercise.3093

Looking at the studies that tried to use exercise alone to induce weight loss, for example, people only lost about three pounds over an average of about six months.3094 The experiments ranged from two to twelve months in duration, with people exercising under supervision for fifteen to seventy minutes at a time, two to five days a week, with intensities ranging from light to vigorous. Putting all the studies together, it looks like it took an average of around eight weeks of exercising to get people to lose a single pound. That was exercise alone, though. What about exercise as an adjunct to diet?

When people are randomized into diet-and-exercise interventions versus diet alone, the diet-and-exercise groups do better, but the difference in weight loss only averages about two pounds.3095 The studies lasted between three and twelve months, and all that extra prescribed exercise seemed to translate into only a few pounds lost. The two-pound difference was statistically significant, however, which means we’re pretty sure it was a real effect, but losing two pounds over a year’s time can hardly be considered clinically significant. As a general rule, researchers like to see at least a five- or six-pound drop.3096

The longer-term trials performed even worse. In a meta-analysis of eighteen randomized controlled studies lasting a minimum of six months, the diet-plus-exercise group failed to beat out the diet-only group at all.3097 There appeared to be no long-term benefit to encouraging people to add exercise to their weight-loss regimens. What is going on? Maybe exercise is better at just preventing people from regaining weight but not losing it to begin with? The vast majority of randomized controlled trials examining weight-loss maintenance also failed to show an exercise benefit.3098

Part of the problem is compliance. It’s one thing to tell people (or even ourselves) to adhere to an exercise regimen; it’s another thing for them to actually do it. A 2018 review found that, in most cases, the groups of people randomized to work out showed no weight-loss benefit. However, if the people who flouted the instructions are excluded and the analysis is limited just to those who actually put in the time and sweat, a clear advantage to exercising emerges.3099 Exercise, like diet, only works if you actually do it. Still, though, people tend to experience less weight loss than one would predict based on the number of calories burned.

Exercise can rev up your baseline metabolic rate. For up to forty-eight hours after a single bout of exercise, you can experience an afterburn effect, known technically as EPOC, or excess post-exercise oxygen consumption. EPOC can bump up our resting metabolic rates as much as 5–10 percent. That may not seem like much, but it can build up. For example, a brisk half-hour walk may only burn 150 calories,3100 but if it then boosts our metabolic rates by 7.5 percent over the subsequent thirty-six hours, that EPOC effect alone could burn an additional 170 calories or so—more than was burned during the actual walk. So we should be burning more calories than expected by exercising, not less. What’s going on?


An Hour a Slice
Our gross overestimation of the capacity of exercise to burn off extra calories may be one reason people can rapidly become disillusioned with their new gym membership.3101 Consider some foods that are CRAP—that is, calorie-rich and processed, as I explained here. To walk off the calories found in a single pat of butter, we’d have to add an extra seven hundred yards to our stroll that evening. What about a Snickers bar? We’d need to jog a quarter mile for every single bite. If we eat two chicken legs, we’d better get out on our own two legs and run an extra three miles that day just to outrun the calories—and that’s for boiled chicken with the skin removed.

A piece of pizza has about three hundred calories, which converts into an hour of brisk walking per slice. How many kids are jogging two hours a day to burn off their Happy Meals? Who’s got time to climb up the Empire State Building’s eighty-six flights to burn off a single donut?3102 That’s one reason what we put into our mouths is most important.

Public health researchers have been experimenting with providing this kind of information for public consumption. Labeling fast-food menus with pictograms of exercising stick figures was found to help nudge people toward lower-calorie options. Once they know that supersizing their fries would mean walking about three extra miles that day or that choosing the chicken salad over the garden salad could mean having to run around three miles, people are more likely to make the healthier choice.3103

For their calculations, the researchers assumed about 125 calories burned per mile run. We’re remarkably efficient animals. It doesn’t take much energy for us to move. Take sex, for instance. One of the “Seven Myths About Obesity” identified in The New England Journal of Medicine is that a bout of sexual activity burns a few hundred calories.3104 So you may think, Hey, I could get a side of fries with that! But if you hook people up (literally and figuratively) and actually measure their oxygen consumption during the act (assuming they don’t get too tangled up in all the wires and hoses), having sex only turns out to be the metabolic equivalent of bowling. Given that the average bout of sexual activity may only last about six minutes, a young man might expend approximately twenty-one calories during intercourse. Because of baseline metabolic needs, he would have spent roughly one-third of that just lounging around watching TV, so the incremental benefit is plausibly on the order of fourteen calories.3105 So maybe he could have one fry with that.



****************************************************************************************************
Licensed to Eat
Evidently, most overweight individuals choose exercise as their first approach to weight loss.3106 When unrealistic hopes inevitably clash with reality, the disappointment may lead to abandonment of weight-loss efforts altogether as an exercise in futility. (Pun intended!) Our false expectations may also give us license to overeat. Our pie-in-the-sky notions about the power of exercise may be used to justify an extra slice of pie right here on earth. Some researchers warn that labeling menus with calorie equivalents of exercise could be counterproductive, backfiring if people rationalize their indulgences after a workout.3107 This concern has actually been put to the test.

Experimental psychologists took a group of men and women, put them on stationary bikes, and had them cycle until they burned either 50 calories or more than 250 calories. Unbeknownst to them, the experimenters effectively manipulated the machines to give false readouts such that, in actuality, both groups burned the same number of calories, about 120; they just thought they had burned more or less than that. The subjects were then offered snacks ten minutes later, ostensibly to measure the “effects of exercise on taste perception and food reward.” The real purpose, however, was to covertly measure how much they ate. Those who falsely believed they had burned off more calories on the stationary bike did seem to demonstrate a greater license to eat, ending up eating significantly more calories—mostly in the form of chocolate chip cookies.3108

After a workout, people may be tempted to treat themselves for their sweaty sacrifice. To prevent this knee-jerk reaction from undermining our efforts, we should strive to make exercise less of a chore. A paper entitled “Is It Fun or Exercise? The Framing of Physical Activity Biases Subsequent Snacking” described a study in which individuals were randomized to the same amount of physical activity, but with different descriptions. Half were told they were going on a “fun walk,” while the other half were told they were going on an “exercise walk.” Afterward, researchers covertly measured how much dessert everyone took at a subsequent meal. Those in the movement-as-exercise group reportedly served themselves about 35 percent more chocolate pudding than the movement-as-fun group.3109

This is all the more reason to choose activities that are enjoyable, such as walking with friends or while listening to music or a podcast, or watching a video while on the treadmill. Reframing exercise as play rather than work may not only make for a more sustainable regimen, it may make us less likely to consciously or unconsciously feel the need to reward ourselves later at the buffet line.

Even just thinking about exercise may compel people to eat more food. Those randomized to simply read about physical activity went on to give themselves nearly 60 percent more M&M’s than those in the control group, adding up to hundreds of extra calories. The researchers concluded that “simply imagining exercising leads participants to serve themselves more food.”

****************************************************************************************************
Working Up an Appetite

Expending energy through exercise may not only predispose us psychologically to eat more, it also may make us hungrier physiologically. As we’ve discussed, we evolved in the context of scarcity, so our bodies place great value on rapidly replenishing lost fat stores.3111 This offers another explanation as to why the average weight loss with exercise training is only 30 percent of that predicted.3112 Calories in versus calories out can be complicated by the fact that changes on one side of the equation can affect the other side too.

Carefully controlled studies show that caloric intake tends to rise over time to match any increase in caloric expenditure, making significant weight loss through exercise alone remarkably difficult.3113 This doesn’t happen over a day or two, though.3114 After a workout, there may not be an immediate increase in hunger, but averaged over the week3115 or weeks,3116 our appetites do tend to increase. This calorie compensation, this attempt to balance it out, isn’t perfect, however, so we can end up with a net loss in body fat, particularly at higher exercise levels.3117

Here’s a concrete example: Overweight men and women were randomized to an exercise regimen that consistently burned off 1,500 calories a week, which would be about forty-five minutes of brisk walking every day, for instance. After twelve weeks of all that extra exertion, they didn’t lose a significant amount of weight. An analysis of the changes that took place in their diets explains why: Yes, they burned 1,500 more calories a week, but they inadvertently started eating about 950 more calories a week. So, at the end of the three months, they were only down about three pounds.3118

What would happen if they doubled their workouts? Burning 3,000 calories a week is equivalent to walking briskly about ninety minutes a day, every day, seven days a week. On that kind of regimen, how much more did they end up eating? Their appetites increased, but not enough to keep up with the increased caloric expenditure, so they ended up losing about six pounds over that same period. Though the 1,500 calories-out group had started taking in about 950 more calories, the 3,000 calories-out group had boosted their intakes a similar amount—about 1,000 calories a week above baseline—so they ended up with a much greater calorie deficit. Our bodies try to compensate by boosting our appetites, but there is a limit.

The secret to weight loss through exercise may be sheer volume: at least three hundred minutes a week to achieve appreciable fat loss.3119

This regulation of our appetites through activity works in both directions. Just as there exists a higher level of exercise where we can start to outpace our appetites and lose weight, there’s a lower level of exercise where our bodies lose the ability to sufficiently downgrade our appetites and we gain weight. This “zone of regulation” where our appetites become uncoupled from our activity levels appears to start at around 7,100 steps a day.3120

If you’ve been a really active person and have to cut back on exercise for whatever reason, you may be surprised that you don’t gain much weight, but that’s likely because your appetite tends to come down as well. Once you cross that threshold, though, once you dip below logging at least 7,100 steps a day on your pedometer, your appetite doesn’t slow much further to match, so the pounds can start to pile on. Your body tries to keep your weight steady by adjusting your appetite, but we just weren’t designed to handle such an extremely low level of movement that sadly characterizes about 80 percent of the U.S. population.

Coming In from the Cold

Swimming and aquatic exercise in general are popular alternatives to land-based activities such as walking or biking.3122 Buoyancy in water helps take some of the weight-bearing stress off joints, but swimming appears to be less effective for weight loss. Obese women were randomized to an hour a day of walking, cycling, or swimming. Six months later, the walkers lost an average of seventeen pounds, the cyclists lost an average of nineteen pounds, but the swimmers didn’t lose an ounce—in fact, they actually gained five pounds. Gauging skin folds to estimate body fat, the measurements slimmed more than 40 percent in the walking and cycling groups, but there was no change at all in the swimming group.3123 What’s going on?

Some exercise boosts appetite more than others. In contrast to walking,3124 running, or cycling,3125 swimming can significantly heighten hunger within hours.3126 This may explain why swimmers tend to have more body fat than runners of equal athletic caliber.3127 If anything, one might think swimming may lead to even greater weight loss since you lose heat to the water, but swimming didn’t seem to work at all.3128 The cold, it turns out, may be the culprit.

If you exercise in warm water (about 90°F), it doesn’t boost your appetite more than exercising on land. After the same workout in cool water (about 70°F), however, people can end up eating more than twice as many snacks an hour later.3129 Maybe they’re just burning off extra calories to stay warm? No, even at the same number of calories expended, people eat hundreds more calories after exercising in colder water. When offered a buffet after burning off about five hundred calories in cool water, people ate nearly nine hundred calories, hundreds more than after exercising in warm water or just resting on dry land.3130

Would the same thing happen under different temperatures on land? A team of British researchers sought to find out, randomizing people to walk briskly for forty-five minutes on a treadmill in the cold (at about 46°F) or at closer to room temperature (about 68°F). Participants were then presented with a buffet meal in which their eating was recorded covertly. Caloric intake was significantly greater after exercising in the cold. The researchers concluded that though walking is often prescribed for overweight individuals, “if walking was to take place in a cold environment, such as in winter, then this may stimulate food intake.”3131 In the warmer months, obesity researchers suggest, exercising outdoors may be preferable to an air-conditioned gym.3132

All studies to date on the effects of hot and cold environments have found that exercising in cool water or under cool conditions on land leads to an increase in post-workout caloric intake.3133 What about a quick dip in the pool after you exercise? Australian researchers found that immersion in water—cool or warm—for fifteen minutes after a running session resulted in increased caloric intake. What is it about getting wet that whets our appetites? Maybe they got a chill after getting wet before they could change into dry clothes? This suggests that although a cool shower after a workout may be invigorating, it might be better to stick to a hot one.

Changing the Equation
Throughout millions of years of our prehistory, starvation was a bigger problem than obesity, so our bodies developed a multitude of ways to fight against weight loss. Let’s look at the energy-balance equation to see how:

body fat = Calories In - Calories Out
￼
In this simplified model of weight basically equaling calories in minus calories out, you can see how the only way our bodies can defend themselves against weight loss if the calories-out factor goes up (we start exercising, for example) is to simultaneously ratchet up the calories-in factor (that is, boost our appetites).

Calories Out(There is a picture for this)
Exercise 						 5%
Diet-Induced Thermogenesis		10%
Non-Exercise Physical Activity 	25%
Resting Metabolic Rate 			60%


Let’s break down the equation further. Calories In means food and beverages; Calories Out means metabolism and motion. Motion can be further separated into exercise versus nonexercise physical activity, and most of the calories people expend on movement fall into the nonexercise category. (Leisure-time exercise, such as working out at the gym, typically only accounts for about 5 percent of daily energy expenditure.) Our resting metabolic rates use up at least 60 percent of our daily calories. Remember diet-induced thermogenesis from the Chronobiology section? That takes up about 10 percent of our daily calories. Movement takes up the remaining 30 percent, but if only 5 percent is structured exercise, the other 25 percent is comprised of nonexercise physical activities, such as cleaning the house or caring for children.3134 The pie chart above illustrates a typical situation.

Body fat = Food + Beverages - Metabolism - Exercise - Other Movement


Since our metabolisms are already remarkably efficient at baseline, there’s limited wiggle room to slow them down much further to prevent us from losing weight. What’s more, exercise can end up boosting our metabolic rates, both through that EPOC afterburn and by building muscle mass, which takes more energy to maintain.3135 Even if our bodies can’t resist exercise-induced weight loss much by slowing our metabolisms, there’s another option besides just boosting our appetites. Can you figure it out by looking at the equation?

An increase in exercise can inadvertently result in a decrease in nonexercise physical activity. When overweight adolescents engaged in an hour of moderate-intensity exercise, they burned off a total of 286 calories. Within that same period, they would have burned off 80 calories just existing. So, at the end of the hour, the exercise group had more than a 200-calorie deficit, and that deficit remained at the end of the day. By the end of the week, though, that calorie-expenditure gap had narrowed to less than 100 calories. The kids had been fitted with high-tech accelerometer devices to measure all their movements over the week. What was happening? The exercise group unintentionally moved less over the few days after the single bout of activity. Simple things like sitting instead of standing or fidgeting less can add up over time and eat away at the gains you make exercising.3136

Again, this makes total sense evolutionarily. Our bodies are trying to conserve energy. If you spend one day chasing (or being chased by) a woolly mammoth, your body tries to mellow you out 
over the next few days to make up for it.3137 It’s like what happens with appetite. You might not feel hungrier the day you exercise, but over the ensuing week, your body tries to fill in the gap.

Let’s say that after you wake up tomorrow, you go out and take an hour-long walk in nice weather. (See the Coming In from the Cold box here to see why this temperature-related caveat is necessary.) Over the rest of the day, you’ll likely end up eating and moving just as much as you would have had you slept in instead of gone for a walk. So if you walked off three hundred calories, at the end of the day, you’ll be left with a three-hundred-calorie deficit. Your body doesn’t like being in the red, though, since millions of years of scarcity-stress has been hardwired into our DNA. As a result, over the next few days, your body starts to chip away at that debt from both directions, nudging you to eat a little more and move a little less such that by the end of the week, all the walked-off calories are back on board. In terms of calorie balance, it’s almost as if you hadn’t taken that walk at all. This explains why so many exercise interventions fail to result in weight loss over time.3138

Over the millennia, those whose bodies failed to defend their fat stores were likely more often felled by famine and long winters. Plopped down into the land of plenty, though, this genetic legacy becomes a handicap. Winners in the ancient fight against famine are today’s losers in the battle of the bulge.3139 But like most handicaps, that just means we may have to work a little harder.

Consider the same scenario as before, but what if you repeat that morning walk every day? Those calorie deficits would start compounding, and your body would be forced to keep up by starting to make withdrawals from your body fat. Perhaps only significant amounts of exercise can cause significant weight 
loss.3140 In a review entitled “Why Do Individuals Not Lose More Weight From an Exercise Intervention…,” the investigators suggested it was in part “primarily due to low doses of prescribed exercise.”3141

Is there a magic exercise threshold that allows us to overcome our bodies’ attempts to undermine our weight loss?

Nearly everyone seems to agree that the current national3142 and international3143 recommendations of 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise simply aren’t enough. That only comes out to be about one hundred calories burned a day, against which our bodies could easily compensate. From an obesity standpoint, this has been considered the “physiological equivalent of bringing a knife to a gunfight.”3144

At the same time, no one disagrees that there isn’t at least some level of exertion that works. Just as extreme inactivity, such as twenty-four-hour bed rest, can reliably increase body fat,3145 extreme activity like military training3146 or mountain climbing3147 can reliably decrease body fat. At about ten times the recommendation—a thousand calories of exercise a day—people lose about a pound a week, down eleven pounds within three months.3148 The question is, what’s the minimum amount of extra physical exertion that we should expect to have a non-negligible effect?

Published recommendations range from the American College of Sports Medicine’s 250 minutes a week3149 up to a USDA-funded paper pushing 250 minutes a day.3150 I checked with the lead author, and, thankfully, the latter was a typo.3151 They also had meant to say weekly. That fits the Healthy Lifestyle Institute’s “200–300 min per week” minimum,3152 a level that can at least help keep our weight stable, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee.3153 For significant weight loss, however, the committee recommends closer to a minimum of 450 minutes a week, or more than an hour a day. Note that these times are for moderate-intensity activity, such as walking. For vigorous activity like running or rapid cycling, exercise duration can be cut by more than half.

The National Academy of Medicine, arguably the most prestigious medical authority in the United States, recommends an hour a day for everyone based on the exercise habits of normal-weight individuals.3154 For those who started out obese but slimmed down and are trying to prevent weight regain, one analysis estimated a threshold of eighty minutes a day was necessary.3155 This falls into the daily sixty-to-ninety minutes range suggested in one systematic review,3156 which is what an earlier version of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended3157 before it wimped out.3158 Such levels of exercise had evidently “not proven manageable.”3159

Up to 50 percent of Americans self-report that they reach the 150 minutes a week recommendation, but if people are hooked up to accelerometers and their movement is objectively measured, what do you think the real number is? Not the 50 percent self-reported, but less than 5 percent. Indeed, rather than one in two people meeting the 150 minutes a week recommendation, it was only one in twenty.3160 Some people can pull it off, though. Those in the National Weight Control Registry who successfully lost lots of weight and kept it off for years evidently average about an hour a day, most commonly in the form of walking. About one in six hardly exercised at all, though, showing it is possible to stay slim without the gym.3161

The bottom line is that exercise for obesity is neither a “myth”3162 nor a “magic bullet.”3163 Sufficient, regular exercise can indeed aid in weight loss, just not nearly as much as most people think.3164 On a population scale, even a 1 percent decrease in body mass index could potentially prevent millions of cases of diabetes and heart disease, and thousands of cases of cancer,3165 but on an individual level, the weight loss can prove disappointingly small.3166 We just have so much more control over the calories-in side of the equation than the calories-out. There is, however, a neat trick.

****************************************************************************************************
NEAT

Why do some people gain more than others? If you experimentally overfeed a group of people the same amount over the same time period, you might assume there would be some variation, but the actual range of variability is truly mind-boggling. In a famous study out of the Mayo Clinic, subjects ate a thousand extra calories every day for eight weeks with no added exercise. In some people, that extra thousand calories translated into only about a spoonful of added daily body fat, whereas others gained more than a third of a cup of body fat every day. By the end of the eight weeks, there was a tenfold variation in fat gain from under a pound in total to more than nine pounds.3167

Hold on. Someone ate fifty-six thousand extra calories and gained less than a single pound of body fat? There’s a law in physics that basically says calories can’t just disappear,3168 so what happened? Let’s look at the energy-balance equation again:

￼
The exercise level for the study subjects was fixed at a steady, low amount, and it turned out their metabolisms didn’t change much. So the only way caloric intake could shoot up without depositing as body fat would be if “other movement” shot up as well. And that’s what happened. The secret to eating in excess of fifty thousand calories without gaining weight is NEAT: nonexercise activity thermogenesis.

NEAT is the heat given off by our regular activities of daily living, such as standing, moving, and fidgeting. On average, fewer than four hundred of those extra thousand calories consumed each day of the study ended up being stored as fat. The bulk was burned off, particularly from a spontaneous increase in movement. One participant inadvertently started moving so much that an extra 692 calories burned off in a day. That’s like spending a quarter of your waking hours in motion.3169

You’d think overfeeding might lead to the opposite: inactivity. I imagine someone crashed on the couch rubbing their swollen belly. But no—when people are fed a thousand extra calories a day, a strange thing happens. They spontaneously start to move more out of some instinctual drive. This could be in the form of fidgeting or gesticulations, a restlessness leading to frequent standing or pacing,3170 using up as many as hundreds of extra calories on average over the course of a day.3171 Basically, NEAT is the sum of calories burned by everything we do that is not sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise.3172

So the primary reason some people gain more weight than others despite eating the same amount of food is that they go weak in the NEAT.3173 Easy gainers just don’t intuitively start moving more to compensate for the extra calories. Indeed, a NEAT deficit has been identified in obesity. Studies show obese individuals tend to remain seated for about two and a half hours longer each day than the average, inactive yet lean, shoestring couch potato.3174 Normal-weight individuals just tend to get up and move around more.

After fitting “sedentary” people with sensors that tracked their posture and movement, researchers were surprised to find they in fact were walking the equivalent of seven miles a day. That distance was just split up into dozens of stints lasting a few minutes at a time simply ambling around throughout the day.3175 Remarkably, those small moments of movement can add up to more than two thousand calories a week, which just so happens to be what those overfed study subjects started burning up and about what you’d get from the hour-a-day exercise recommended for weight loss.3176

Just by subtly moving around more, your body can drain off as many calories as pounding it out an hour a day at the gym. Remember those extra 692 calories a day burned off by the study subject who had inadvertently started moving more? That’s more than you might burn rock climbing for an hour. Given its demonstrated power, if our bodies aren’t going to move more unconsciously, then maybe we should make a conscious effort to accrete some NEAT.


Staying One Move Ahead
Since prescriptions for structured exercise have so often failed to result in appreciable weight loss, some obesity researchers have turned to trying to enhance NEAT instead.3177 After all, remember the pie chart? Nonexercise activity typically burns off at least five times more calories a day than an average exercise program. The reason the Amish have some of the lowest rates of obesity is not a high prevalence of gym memberships. They walk an average of eighteen thousand steps a day just living their lives.3178

You don’t have to go full horse-and-buggy to enjoy the benefits of nonexercise activity thermogenesis. NEAT means taking the stairs instead of the escalator and parking at the far end of the lot. It means singing, laughing, cleaning, and doing yard work—any activity that creates muscular contractions. Cooking dinner burns five to ten times more calories than sitting in front of the TV.3179

Imagine two scenarios of modern life: An office worker drives to work, sits all day at their desk, drives home, and then sits all evening watching television or surfing the internet. If they had gotten home at 5:00 p.m. and went to bed at 11:00 p.m., those six hours of leisure time probably wouldn’t expend more than fifty calories, even if they double-thumbed the remote control. What if instead, when our hypothetical office worker got home, they started raking leaves or vacuuming? They would have burned about ten times more calories that same evening3180 and around twenty times more if they more actively commuted, like biking rather than driving to work.


****************************************************************************************************
Dynamic Sitting

Sedentary comes from the Latin word meaning to sit, but just because you’re sitting doesn’t mean you’re sedentary—just ask any cyclist or rower. The problem is sitting motionlessly. That causes blood to pool and stagnate in our legs, which can result in arterial dysfunction. Just like our muscles can atrophy from disuse, it may be use it or lose it when it comes to artery function as well. Special cells lining our arteries can detect the tugging, sheer force of the blood flowing past and send signals through the artery wall to maintain proper structure and function.

Significant decrements in artery function can be detected within three hours of sitting,3201 while three hours of standing, even while motionless, does not produce the same effect. Part of the reason blood flow can be stanched nearly 40 percent by prolonged sitting3202 is the ninety-degree angle in our knees that kinks our blood vessels.3203 When that’s straightened out by standing, our arteries remain fully functional.

If standing or dynamic workstations are not an option, taking five-minute walking breaks every hour can prevent the stiffening of the arteries that comes with prolonged sitting.3204 Frequent trips to the watercooler (and then subsequently to the restroom) or taking out the trash during commercial breaks can maintain full artery function.

What are your options if you really can’t walk away from your workstation? Exercising your legs for forty-five minutes before sitting down can preserve artery function3205—another advantage to an active commute. Researchers concluded that “people should be encouraged to engage in aerobic leg exercise before sitting for extended periods of time and, if this is not possible, sitting should be replaced by standing.”3206

Just standing intermittently for a few minutes an hour does not appear sufficient to counteract the adverse effects of sitting, and neither does a few minutes of pedaling under your desk with one of those sit-cycle gadgets.3207 Constant standing works, though, as presumably would constant pedaling, an example of “dynamic sitting.” You may have noticed people in an office sitting on large rubber stability balls. That does activate trunk muscles in your core, but it’s been found to cause more low-back discomfort and spinal shrinkage,3208 likely due to the absence of a backrest.

What about a fidget chair that allows for a degree of side-to-side lateral movement of your hips?3209 Unfortunately, people tend to move so little while seated in them that they only burn about thirteen more calories an hour compared to sitting in a regular chair.3210 A cheaper way to burn comparable calories while sitting is the use of a fidget bar, a device referred to in the medical literature as an “under-the-table leg-movement apparatus.”3211 It’s sort of like a balance beam that hangs under your desk that you can put your feet on to fiddle around, burning up an extra twenty-two calories an hour.3212 Either fidgety approach could easily add up to burning one hundred calories a day.

Does seated fidgeting protect our arteries, though? Researchers had people intermittently fidget just one leg for one minute out of every five, while keeping their other leg still. While artery function in the resting leg dropped, that of the restless leg experienced a pronounced improvement.3213 This helps explain why frequent fidgeting appears to neutralize the mortality risk of prolonged sitting.3214 What I liked most about the one-leg fidget study was that the researchers didn’t rely on any fancy gizmos. They simply had people tap their heel by bouncing their knee at their own natural cadence, something we can all try to remember to do. Just try not to annoy the person you’re sitting beside on the airplane or at the movies.


The Object of the Exercise

Should word get out that exercise is relatively ineffective for weight loss, it could have negative public health implications. The problem with the prevailing bait and switch of “come for the weight loss and stay for the longevity” is that it could end up being counterproductive, which is why some experts suggest we should promote exercise without any mention of weight loss.3215 The fear is that the relatively unchanging number on the bathroom scale will disillusion people out of exercising altogether, and then they really would miss out on exercise’s myriad benefits, which may indeed include living longer. Walking briskly just fifteen minutes a day is associated with a life span gain of about two years, for example, and an hour a day may give us four more years on this earth.3216

While the data on exercise for weight loss are relatively weak, the evidence supporting the overall health benefits of physical activity is overwhelming.3217 For example, forty minutes a day, four days a week, can improve erectile function in men.3218 Being more fit can mean having more fun, all the while reducing risk of breast cancer,3219 colon cancer,3220 diabetes, gallstones, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke.3221 Exercise can also help minimize the bone loss that can accompany weight loss.3222

A single exercise session can improve insulin sensitivity for up to seventeen hours3223 and may be used to treat prediabetes as effectively as medications.3224 Exercise is medicine. Researchers at Harvard and Stanford found that exercise may work as well as drugs for coronary heart disease patients and even better than some medicines for stroke. They suggested that drug companies should perhaps be required to compare any new chronic disease drugs head-to-head against exercise, as “patients deserve to understand the relative impact that physical activity might have on their condition.”


Visceral Reaction

The number on the scale doesn’t tell the full story. When obese diabetics were put through four months of strength training, they didn’t achieve any significant weight loss, which is typical. They did, however, lose about eight pounds of body fat! The reason that loss didn’t register on the scale is that they gained about seven pounds of lean body mass.3226 They lost fat while gaining muscle, and their blood sugar control improved to reflect that, so it wasn’t a wash at all. Far from it. Aerobic exercise can cause a similar fat loss in thirteen weeks, with no significant difference noted between thirty minutes a day and sixty minutes a day,3227 though those putting in two-hour bouts do separate out from the pack.3228

One of the reasons exercise can be such a lifesaver is that, while it may not affect our overall weights, it can help get rid of our most dangerous body fat—that visceral fat slithering around our internal abdominal organs.3229 A systematic review found that even in the absence of weight loss, exercise may cause a 6 percent drop in visceral fat levels.3230 Exercise in particular seems to home in and burn off the worst fat first. An average obese person losing about ten pounds through caloric restriction might remove about 13 percent of their visceral fat, but the same amount of weight loss through exercise could wipe out 21 percent.3231

What about doing crunches? Thanks to advertising claims from companies trying to sell people various exercise gadgets and workouts targeting the tummy, there’s a common perception that we can reduce our waistlines solely by doing abdominal exercises. Seven different abdominal exercises were put to the test, including sit-ups, leg lifts, and abdominal crunches, two sets of ten repetitions each for five days a week. After six weeks, there was no effect on abdominal fat.3232 All that core conditioning only took about ten minutes a day, so that just doesn’t burn enough calories to make a difference. Based on averaging together a dozen or so studies, it may take three months of around three hours of aerobic exercise a week to take an inch off our waists.3233 One inch may not seem like a lot, but on a CT scan or MRI cross section of our abdomens, that may mean the removal of a respectable five square inches of visceral belly fat.3234 When it comes to the worst of the worst kind of fat, aerobic exercise appears to beat out resistance exercise.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
All Walks of Life

Running isn’t for everyone, though. Vigorous activity is warned against in certain heart conditions and can be difficult or uncomfortable for the beginner.3243 Walking, on the other hand, can be easy, safe, and sociable, and may therefore be “ideal as a gentle start-up for the sedentary.”3244 Hippocrates evidently called walking “man’s best medicine”3245 (and it works for women too!).

Pooled together, twenty-two studies of walking for weight loss found that an average of forty-five minutes or so of brisk walking about four times a week for three or four months removes nearly six pounds of body fat and takes about an inch off the waist.3246 What’s the optimum dose? The more the better. The longer you walk and the faster you walk, the more calories you burn—though not as many as might be expected due to compliance and compensation.

When doctors prescribed ninety minutes of walking a day as part of a research protocol, within three weeks, accelerometer data showed people were actually only putting in sixty-five minutes a day, and those prescribed sixty minutes were only walking about forty minutes. Those prescribed thirty minutes, however, were keeping up with their full half hour.3247 So, though those prescribed more did walk more, asking people to triple their walking time may only end up doubling it.

All the study subjects were told to add the walking on top of their baseline levels of activity, but that only worked to varying degrees. Adding thirty minutes of walking to their routines didn’t affect the rest of their daily activity much, but most of the extra steps in the ninety-minute group were effectively lost since the participants compensated by moving so much less over the remainder of the day. Nearly two-thirds of the added exercise was offset by a reduction of other daily activities. Still, even with the compensation and compliance, those who set out to do more, did more.3248 The optimal duration is as long as possible.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************

Timing Is Everything … Right?
What’s the best exercise dose for weight loss? The more the better. What about the optimal timing? Is it better to exercise in the morning or the evening? Before or after breakfast? A Nobel Prize–winning exercise physiologist said he always ran a mile every morning before breakfast.3249 Was that prize-winning timing?

More than a dozen experiments have been published comparing the amount of fat burned in a fasted state versus a fed state, and every single one found more fat was burned on an empty stomach. On average, a single bout of low- to moderate-intensity activity before a meal burned off three more grams of fat than the same amount of exercise after a meal.3250 Same amount of exercise, but more fat loss just because of timing.

Simply because you burn more fat while exercising doesn’t necessarily mean you end up with less fat at the end of the day. Maybe our bodies offset the extra fat loss that occurs during exercise with a little extra fat storage when you finally do eat, balancing out the equation. Researchers in Japan set out to investigate this possibility by measuring twenty-four-hour fat balance after one hundred minutes of running either before breakfast or after lunch. On the exercise-after-lunch day, subjects burned a total of 608 calories of fat over the course of that day. In contrast, on the exercise-before-breakfast day, in the same twenty-four-hour period, they burned through nearly 90 percent more—1,142 calories of straight fat.3251 So the next day, before-breakfast exercisers woke up with about a quarter cup less fat after the same amount of exercise. Remarkable!

Running for one hundred minutes is pretty hard-core no matter whether you do it before or after breakfast. What about something less intense, like walking? Study subjects walked for sixty minutes at different times of the day—before breakfast, after lunch, or after dinner—and also had a control day when they didn’t exercise at all. Over twenty-four hours, they burned off 432 fat calories after exercising in the evening and 446 fat calories after walking in the afternoon. On the exercise-free control day, however, they burned through 456 fat calories. It’s almost as if the post-lunch and post-dinner walkers hadn’t walked at all. What about a pre-breakfast walk? The same amount of exercise before breakfast resulted in 717 calories of fat loss.3252 Over the course of a day, timing truly does matter.

All such similar studies on both men and women show we burn through more fat on the days we exercise before, rather than after, eating.3253 After reading the Chronobiology section, though, an alternative explanation may spring to mind. Maybe it’s just a morning thing. Is it possible it has nothing to do with meals at all and our circadian rhythms are dictating the difference?3254 No. Exercising in the morning after breakfast appears no better than exercising in the evening after dinner,3255,3256 and exercising before breakfast works better than immediately after breakfast, yet both are still in the morning.3257 It really does seem to be a pre- versus post-meal effect—but why?

Skinny Dip

Carbohydrate is the preferred fuel for our bodies. Whenever you eat sugars or starches, they get broken down and converted into blood sugar. After a meal, blood sugars rise, and our muscles are quick to snatch them up for fuel without having to rely much on our energy stores. If you take a siesta after a meal, your muscles have no immediate need for energy, so the excess blood sugar from that meal can be stored for later use in the muscles in the form of glycogen, which is just a bunch of blood sugar molecules strung together into a mass of branches that can be broken off and used for quick bursts of energy anytime you need them.

If you exercise after a meal, your muscles can siphon off some of the extra blood sugar floating around for energy. When you work out before a meal, though, your muscles have to resort to dipping into your energy stores and end up burning mostly a combination of glycogen and fat.3258 That explains why you burn more fat during fasted exercise, but what about all the extra fat burned throughout the rest of the day?

Glycogen is more than a store.3259 It isn’t just an energy reserve. Glycogen acts as a sensor capable of activating metabolic pathways. Exercising before breakfast can exhaust as much as 18 percent of your glycogen stores, and that depletion can act as a powerful rallying cry to your fatty tissues to start pulling more of their weight by breaking down more fat. The lower glycogen stores fall, the greater the sustained twenty-four-hour fat loss.3260

How long do you have to go without food in order to trigger this effect? Six hours may be sufficient, so before breakfast isn’t the only optimal window.3261 If you timed it right, you could exercise midday before a late lunch or, if you had an early enough lunch, before dinner after you got home from work.

If exercise in a fasted state isn’t possible, does it matter what you eat? Insulin release after a meal appears to play a critical role in suppressing fat breakdown,3262 which explains why lower-glycemic foods can have less of an effect.3263 Lentils were identified as a promising option for maintaining athletic endurance,3264 which can take a hit on an empty stomach,3265 while maintaining more of the fat dissolution. They are “unlikely to be consumed by the general population,” though, wrote one research team, “due to low palatability.”3266 (They obviously haven’t tried my mom’s lentil soup.)

A systematic review and meta-analysis on exercise timing for fat metabolism found that exercising in a completely fasted state may work best.3267 The Japanese team who published some of the seminal work in this area went as far as asserting: “If exercise were a pill to burn body fat, it would be effective only when taken before breakfast.”3268 Surveys show few people exercise before breakfast, though.3269 Before asking people to make the switch, we need to make sure that these tantalizing, twenty-four-hour results translate into weight loss over the long term. There’s a solid theoretical basis, but you don’t know until you put it to the test.

In a study of experimental weight gain, volunteers were fed up to 4,500 calories a day for six weeks while vigorously exercising a total of three hundred minutes a week, always either after an overnight fast or after a meal. A control group who didn’t exercise at all but consumed the same extra calories gained about six and a half pounds, compared to three pounds gained in the exercise-after-a-meal group. The premeal exercise group worked out the same amount and ate the same amount, but they only gained half as much, one and a half pounds.3270 What about weight loss, though?

Twenty young women on calorie-restricted diets were randomized to exercise for three hours a week either before or after a meal. Same diets, same amount of exercise, and, disappointingly, about the same amount of weight loss. The premeal exercise group did lose about an extra pound of body fat (total weight loss of three and a half pounds versus two and one-fifth pounds), but this did not reach statistical significance, meaning such a small difference could very well have been due to chance.3271 Similarly, a study of six weeks of low-volume, high-intensity interval training before or after meals also failed to show a difference.3272

One explanation that’s been offered for this failure is that the increased fat loss during premeal exercise might be “neutralized” by the lesser diet-induced thermogenesis.3273 It costs our bodies fewer calories to process food if we eat after physical activity compared to eating before. When we exercise after a meal, our bodies get mixed signals. Exercise is all about mobilizing energy stores for fuel, whereas eating is more about assimilation and storage. So the metabolic challenge presented by the ensuing hormonal “tug-of-war”3274 might be responsible for the 15–40 percent greater calorie cost.3275 This has led some to recommend exercising after meals to facilitate weight loss.3276 If you do the math, though, diet-induced thermogenesis makes such a small contribution that this might only come out to be three to twelve calories.3277 Such a slight difference would be easily overwhelmed by the big disparity in fat loss, as confirmed by the twenty-four-hour fat-balance studies.

I would suggest a more reasonable explanation might be that the clear body-fat deficit on premeal exercise days is made up for by extra fat storage on nonexercise days. Our bodies like to hold on to body fat if they can, so, on days you aren’t driving it down, it may try to even things out. Both of the failed weight-loss studies had people exercising only three days a week, so their bodies had most of the week to compensate. The study I’d love to see is pre- versus post-meal exercise on all or at least most of the days of the week to see if we can continue to drive down fat stores.

Blood Sugar Taming Through Timing

You can imagine how that siphoning effect muscles have on excess blood sugar during exercise might be great for those suffering from elevated blood sugars. Indeed, exercising after a meal can bring down blood sugars as well as some blood sugar–lowering drugs.3278 Randomize type 2 diabetics to a leisurely twenty-minute stroll (about 2 mph) before dinner or after dinner, and you can show that after-dinner walking can comparatively blunt blood sugar spikes by 30 percent.3279 Same meal, same amount of exercise, same intensity of exercise, but with a significant bonus effect on blood sugar control, thanks to a little tactical timing. Even just a ten-minute walk after a meal may make a difference.3280 So for those with blood sugar problems, it’s better to exercise after meals than before them.

Blood sugar from a meal starts appearing in the bloodstream fifteen to twenty minutes after the first bite. It ramps up after thirty minutes to peak around the one-hour mark before declining to premeal levels within a few hours.3281 For optimal blood sugar control, prediabetics and diabetics should start exercising thirty minutes after the start of a meal and ideally go for an hour to completely straddle the blood sugar peak.3282 If you had to choose a single meal to exercise after, it would be dinner,3283 due to the circadian rhythm of blood sugar control that wanes throughout the day. Ideally, though, breakfast would be the largest meal of the day, and you’d exercise after that—or, even better, after every meal.


A Walk in the Park
Exercise recommendations for obesity have been referred to as the “mysterious case of the public health guideline that is (almost) entirely ignored.” Governmental, scientific, and professional organizations call for at least an hour of exercise a day for weight management, but almost no obese adults meet this target.3285 Surveys suggest Americans watch TV about ten times more than they exercise, and for obese Americans, it may be even worse.3286 Only 2 percent even reach thirty minutes of exercise a day,3287 and the percentage exceeding an hour a day is expected to be close to zero.3288

Why don’t obese individuals exercise more? Rather than speculate, why don’t we just ask? When questioned, obese adults typically describe exercise as being “unpleasant, uncomfortable and unenjoyable.”3289 So how can we break this vicious cycle, where inactivity can lead to weight gain, which can lead to further inactivity and even more weight gain? The first thing to recognize is that it is normal and natural to be physically lazy.3290

Laziness is in our genes. We evolved to instinctually avoid unnecessary exertion to conserve energy for survival and reproduction. These days, there’s no shortage of available fuel, yet the hardwired inertia remains. Our ancient ancestors are presumed to have exercised only when it was necessary or when it was fun, as a form of play.3291 The only way exercise is going to work long term for weight control is if it becomes a stable, lifelong habit,3292 so you need to restructure your surroundings to require more physical activity (like working at a treadmill desk) and figure out how to make exercise more enjoyable.3293

Here’s a piece of wise advice from a 1925 medical journal entry: “The best prescription to be written for a walk is to take a dog … and a friend.”3294 Listening to your favorite music might also help. Music has been described as a “legal method”3295 for improving peak performance and, more importantly, the enjoyment of high-intensity interval training.3296 During exercise, listening to a preferred playlist can significantly reduce our “rate of perceived exertion,” which is how hard you feel your body is working.3297 Put severely obese youth on a treadmill and have them go until exhaustion with or without music, and those listening to their favorite tunes tended to make it about 5 percent longer. This was chalked up to “attentional distraction”—the music may have helped keep their minds off feelings of fatigue.3298 If that’s the case, listening to a podcast or audiobook may have a similar effect.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
I bristle at the marketing talk, but the nice thing about exercise is that it really can deliver on all those fronts—fostering elixir-of-life feelings of joy and vitality while helping people physically fulfill their goals in life. Frame a walk as exercise, and people report feeling more fatigued and in a worse mood than after going the same distance on a walk framed as fun.3306 And it really can be fun. When sedentary individuals are started on an exercise regimen, they report enjoying it significantly more than they had expected.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

The bottom line with exercise is that any amount is good3308 and the more the better.3309 If, however, you are a man over forty-five, are a woman over fifty-five, have diabetes, or experience symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath, I would recommend checking with your health professional before starting a new exercise regimen.3310

The evidence for the health benefits of exercise in general is overwhelming. Obesity can exacerbate disabling, painful conditions, such as osteoarthritis of the knees, making exercise more difficult but all the more essential. Losing weight doesn’t just ease pain in the overloaded joints in the lower back, hips, knees, and ankles. The anti-inflammatory effects of exercise can also alleviate headaches and more diffuse, chronic, musculoskeletal aches and pains that disproportionately affect overweight individuals.3311 However, the efficacy for weight loss is underwhelming for all but the most voluminous regimens. I did offer some suggestions to maximize fat loss, but on the whole, the limitations just make the calories-in side of the equation—that is, the dietary tweaks—all the more important. But overall, exercise is win-win: adding years to your life and life to your years.

FAT BLOCKERS

Eat Your Thylakoids

Turn Over a New Leaf

What on earth is a thylakoid? No big deal, just the source of nearly all known life and the oxygen we breathe. Thylakoids are where photosynthesis, the process by which plants turn light into food, takes place. Microscopic saclike structures composed of chlorophyll-rich membranes concentrated in the leaves of plants, thylakoids are the green engine of life.

When we eat them, when we bite into a leaf of spinach, for instance, the thylakoid membranes are able to resist our digestive enzymes. They can last for hours in our intestines before finally getting broken down,3312 and it is in those hours when they work their magic. Thylakoid membranes bind to lipase, the enzyme our bodies make to digest fat, thereby helping to block fat absorption.3313 This mechanism is like a natural version of the fat-blocking drug orlistat, but without the anal leakage.3314 Unlike the drug, the thylakoids do finally break down, eventually freeing the lipase enzyme to do its job before fat comes spilling out your other end.3315 Ultimately, fat absorption is not so much blocked by thylakoids as it is delayed.

If all the fat is eventually absorbed, what’s the benefit? Location, location, location. Remember that ileal brake effect I described in the High in Fiber-Rich Foods section? By delaying calorie absorption until that tail end of the small intestine, strong satiety signals are sent to our brains saying, in effect, that you are full from stem to stern, thus dialing down your appetite.3316 If you feed someone a meal with added thylakoids (by slipping in some powdered spinach, for instance) and measure the level of hormone release into their bloodstreams over the next six hours, you see a significant rise in a satiety hormone called CCK, as well as a drop in the hunger hormone ghrelin.3317 Does this then translate into a drop in appetite? Researchers were eager to find out.

Spinach extracts were disguised in jam3318 and juice3319 to sneak thylakoids into meals, and those unwittingly eating the equivalent of about a half cup of cooked spinach felt significantly less hungry and more satiated over the next few hours. Give someone the equivalent of a shot of wheatgrass juice or what they might get in a “green drink” or green smoothie, and not only do they feel more satiated, but their cravings for sweet, salty, and fatty snacks, such as potato chips, chocolate, and cinnamon buns, drop by about a third. Feed them candy anyway, and those who unknowingly had been snuck some spinach report liking the sweets significantly less.3320 The satiating power of greens has been attributed to their high fiber and water contents and low-calorie density,3321 but the thylakoids may be their secret weapon.

The majority of thylakoid trials to date have shown improvements in satiety,3322 but what about weight loss? Researchers in Sweden randomized overweight women to blended blueberry drinks every morning with or without “green-plant membranes” (powdered spinach). Within twelve weeks, the women who had been slipped spinach lost three pounds more than the control group. The spinach group’s cravings for sweets diminished, and as a bonus, their bad LDL cholesterol dropped, too, even before the weight loss started kicking in.3323 If you instead fix their caloric intakes to force the same weight loss, those randomized to the spinach group appeared to have an easier time with eating less. They experienced less hunger after a test meal after weeks of eating green.3324

Extracts of spinach were used in these studies so the researchers could create convincing placebos, but you can get just as many thylakoids eating about a half cup of cooked greens. Which greens have the most? You can tell just by looking at them.3325 Because thylakoids are where the chlorophyll is, the greener the leaves, the more potent the effect.3326 So go for the darkest-green greens you can find. In the store where I shop, that’s the Lacinato (or dinosaur) kale.

What happens when you cook greens? Blanched for fifteen seconds or so in steaming or boiling water, they actually get even brighter green, but if you cook them too long, they eventually turn a drab olive brown. When greens are overcooked, the thylakoids physically degrade, along with their ability to inhibit lipase. Within that first minute when the green gets even more vibrant, though, there’s a slight boost in fat-blocking ability.3327 So you can gauge thylakoid activity in both the grocery store and the kitchen with your own two eyes.

Which are the best greens, and what is the best cooking method? The best green vegetable and the best way to cook it is whichever, and however, you’ll end up eating the most. We’ve been chewing on leaves for millions of years,3328 but today, the greenest thing about some people’s diets may be a St. Patrick’s Day pint. Americans average fewer than two grams of spinach a day, not even half a teaspoon.3329 Our bodies were designed to have thylakoids passing through our systems on a daily basis, so the delay in fat absorption can be thought of as the default, normal state.3330 It’s only when we eat greens-deficient diets that the accelerated fat digestion undercuts our natural satiety mechanisms. In the Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, a group of food technologists argued that given their fat-blocking benefits, “thylakoid membranes could be incorporated in functional foods as a new promising appetite-reducing ingredient”3331—or you can just get them in the way Mother Nature intended.

Choose Low-Oxalate Greens

Kidney stones affect as many as one in ten people in their lifetime and can cause excruciating pain.3332 I instinctively cross my legs just thinking about them. Oxalate stones are the most common type,3333 forming when the oxalate concentration gets so high in our urine it basically crystallizes out of solution like rock candy. Some foods, like spinach, have lots of oxalates in them. Should we try to reduce our intakes of oxalates to lower our risk? It turns out that people who get stones don’t appear to eat any more oxalates on average than people who don’t get stones.3334 It’s less what you eat and more what you absorb. People who are predisposed to kidney stones just appear to be born with a higher intestinal oxalate absorption.3335 Their guts just really soak it up. So-called super absorbers assimilate up to 50 percent more oxalate than non-stone-formers.3336

Overall, the impact of typical dietary oxalate on urine levels appears to be small.3337 Feed people a “massive”3338 dose of dietary oxalates, and most only experience a relatively mild increase in the amount that makes it into their urine.3339 Still, until you get your first stone, how do you know if you’re a super absorber or not? Is it safer to just generally avoid higher oxalate fruits and vegetables? Well, people who eat more fruits and veggies actually tend to get fewer kidney stones.3340 In fact, when researchers put it to the test and removed produce from people’s diets, their kidney stone risk went up.3341

Removing fruits and vegetables can make our dietary oxalate intakes go down, but it also impairs our bodies’ ability to get rid of the oxalate we produce on our own. Oxalate is formed internally as a waste product, and our bodies have more difficulty getting rid of it without the alkalizing effects of fruits and vegetables on our urine’s pH.3342 This may help explain why those eating plant-based diets get fewer kidney stones, though it also may be due to their reduction in meat intake, as meat consumption can have an acid-forming effect in the kidneys.3343 A single can of tuna a day can increase our risk of forming stones by 250 percent,3344 for example, and just cutting back on animal protein can help cut kidney stone risk in half.3345

Surely, there must be some level of oxalate intake that could put people at risk regardless. The study that showed a “massive” load of dietary oxalate didn’t have much of an effect on urine levels used 250 mg of oxalates.3346 That’s a massive dose if we were talking about most greens—for example, 25 cups of collard greens, 60 cups of mustard greens, 125 cups of kale, or 250 cups of bok choy—but it’s less than a half cup of spinach.3347 Spinach really is an outlier. Even though there are small amounts of oxalates found throughout the food supply, spinach alone may account for 40 percent of oxalate intake in the United States.3348 The Harvard cohorts found that men and older (but not younger) women who ate spinach eight or more times a month had about 30 percent higher risk of developing kidney stones.3349

Oxalates are water-soluble, so blanching collard greens, for example, can reduce oxalate levels by up to a third.3350 (In that case, the oxalate load of those twenty-five cups of raw collards could be bumped up to thirty-three cups of blanched collards!) Steaming spinach reduces oxalate levels by 30 percent, and boiling cuts them by more than half. Boil the three high-oxalate greens—spinach, beet greens, and swiss chard—and up to 60 percent of the oxalates are leached into the cooking water.3351 They start out so high, though, that they would still contain hundreds of times more oxalates than low-oxalate greens like kale.

Who may benefit from avoiding the big three high-oxalate greens? Anyone who has a history of kidney stones, is otherwise at high risk (for example, those who take megadoses of vitamin C,3352 have a history of long-term broad-spectrum antibiotic use,3353 or had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery3354), or who eats cups of greens a day. (I personally try to eat at least a pound of greens a day, which is about three cups cooked or a dozen raw.) This is especially important for those who juice or blend their greens, as oxalates appear to be absorbed more rapidly in liquid than solid form.3355

Other high-oxalate foods that have been associated with kidney problems at high enough doses include chaga mushroom powder (four to five teaspoons a day),3356 rhubarb (four cups a day),3357 almonds3358 or cashews (more than a cup a day),3359 and star fruit (a single dose of one and a quarter cup juice3360 or four to six fruit).3361 Excessive tea consumption can also be a problem, especially of instant tea powder, which boosts urine oxalate nearly four times higher than brewed tea.3362 Two cases of kidney damage attributed to drinking sixteen daily glasses of iced tea have been reported.


****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
The Calcium Effect
Another reason to give preference to low-oxalate greens is that they are less stingy with their calcium. While less than a third of the calcium in milks (whether from cow3365 or plant3366) may be bioavailable, most of the calcium in low-oxalate greens is absorbed.3367 The bioavailability of some greens is twice that of milks, but the oxalates in spinach, swiss chard, and beet greens bind to the calcium, preventing the absorption. It works both ways, though.3368 The calcium binds to the oxalate too. That’s why some gastric bypass surgeries result in enhanced oxalate absorption.3369 The procedures can cause fat malabsorption. The fat steals away the calcium bound to the oxalate to form a type of soap in our intestines,3370 and the oxalate is then freed to be absorbed.

Wait a second. If calcium is so good at grabbing onto fat in the gut, might calcium-rich foods act as fat blockers too? The problem with fat-blocking drugs is that the undigested fat comes out the other end, resulting in fecal leakage. But if calcium turns the fat into a semisolid soap, there’s no oily discharge,3371 and when we poop out the fat-calcium soap, we poop out all those fat calories contained therein.

The dairy industry was excited to put it to the test. When 1,200 mg or so of calcium in the form of cheese was added to people’s diets, instead of losing about four grams of fat in their stool each day, they excreted closer to six grams of fat.3372 The extra calcium caused the body to absorb two fewer grams of fat. Of course, that much cheese has more than fifty grams of fat,3373 so it makes no sense to add fifty grams so you can get rid of two. You can imagine, though, how adding a fat-free source of calcium—skim milk, or even healthier, low-oxalate greens—could result in a small, negative fat balance every day. Orlistat can block about sixteen grams of fat a day,3374 whereas a meta-analysis of the calcium fat-blocking studies confirmed only the two-gram difference.3375 But if you absorbed two fewer grams of fat a day, that’s eighteen calories you won’t be holding on to, which, if not compensated for, could add up to a pound of fat loss.3376 (Of course, another way to prevent two grams of fat from being absorbed is just to consume a half-teaspoon less oil every day.)

Nondairy sources of calcium appear to work just as well as dairy sources,3377 and the small fat-blocking effect does not appear to diminish with time.3378 Does this translate into weight loss? When people were randomized to take 1,000 mg of calcium supplements a day, all the extra little bits of daily fat loss added up to about two pounds of body fat lost over six months compared to placebo.3379 Interventions using dairy didn’t show any significant body fat loss,3380 presumably because the added calories from the dairy itself counteracted any fat-blocking effects.3381

Caloric-restriction trials in which dairy calories were swapped in rather than added, though, did show an average of about two pounds of fat loss over an average of five months, helping to confirm the calcium effect. Unfortunately, none of the dairy studies lasting a year or longer showed a significant benefit, but they were mostly nonsubstitution trials, so presumably people just weren’t able to compensate for the added dairy calories.3382 Even dairy industry–funded scientists have been forced to conclude that dairy consumption has “no clinically meaningful effect” when it comes to promoting weight loss.3383 We know the calcium fat-blocking effect is real, though. If only it could be provided in a safe, satiating form. It can. That’s why greens—high in fiber, low in calories—may be the perfect delivery vehicle, combining the effects of thylakoids and calcium into one package deal.

Calcium Supplement Safety

In twelve short years, expert panels went from suggesting widespread calcium supplementation to prevent osteoporosis3384 to “do not supplement,”3385 the recommendation that remains for most people to this day.3386 What happened? It all started with a 2008 study in New Zealand.3387

Researchers were hoping to prevent heart attacks by giving people calcium supplements. Short-term studies have shown that calcium supplementation may drop blood pressures by about a point.3388 Though the effect appears to be transient, disappearing after a few months, it’s better than nothing.3389 Further, the fat-blocking effect of calcium could theoretically lower cholesterol levels by preventing a bit of saturated fat from getting into the system.3390 To the researchers’ surprise, however, instead of fewer heart attacks, there appeared to be more heart attacks in the calcium-supplement group.3391 Was this just a fluke?

All eyes turned to the Women’s Health Initiative, the largest and longest randomized controlled trial of calcium supplementation. If that name sounds familiar, it’s because that’s the very study that uncovered how dangerous hormone replacement therapy was. Would it uncover the same for calcium supplements?

The Women’s Health Initiative reported no adverse effects. However, the majority of the participants were already taking calcium supplements before the study started. So, effectively, the study was just comparing higher versus lower doses of calcium supplementation rather than supplementation versus no supplementation. What if you go back and see what happened to the women who started out not taking supplements and then were randomized to the supplement group? Those who started calcium supplements suffered significantly more heart attacks or strokes.3392 Thus, whether high dose or low dose, any calcium supplementation seemed to increase cardiovascular disease risk.

Researchers went back, digging through other trial data for heart attack and stroke rates in people randomized to calcium supplements, and they confirmed the danger.3393 Most of the population studies also agreed: Users of calcium supplements tended to have increased rates of heart disease, stroke, and death.3394

The supplement industry was not happy, accusing researchers of relying in part on self-reported data—that is, simply asking if people had had a heart attack or not, rather than verifying it.3395 That’s not as much of a stretch as it may sound. Long-term calcium supplementation can cause all sorts of gastrointestinal distress, including twice the risk of being hospitalized with acute symptoms that may have been confused with a heart attack.3396 However, the increased cardiovascular risk was seen consistently across the trials, regardless of whether the heart attacks were verified or not.3397

The calcium supplementation and heightened cardiovascular risk link continues to be a rising concern.3398 Thankfully, supplementation rates dropped when the news came out, though some doctors continue to prescribe calcium for prevention.3399 This inertia has been attributed to a complex web of industry ties with advocacy organizations and academia to protect the $6 billion business.3400

Why might calcium supplements increase heart attack risk, whereas the same calcium you get in foods does not? When you take calcium pills, you get an unnaturally large, rapid, and sustained spike of calcium in your bloodstream that can last as long as eight hours. This can cause your blood to clot more easily, which could increase the risk of forming clots in the heart or brain.3401 Of course, if you’re worried about heart attacks, there are risky food sources of calcium too. (I’m looking at you, cheese.)

The best sources of calcium are Green Light foods like leafy greens. In How Not to Die, I defined my Green Light category as foods of plant origin to which nothing bad has been added and from which nothing good has been taken away. Green Light whole plant foods, unlike dairy, package calcium with lots of fiber, folate, iron, antioxidants, and thylakoids, instead of the baggage that too often accompanies milk products, such as sodium, cholesterol, and saturated butterfat. Despite the global dairy industry’s campaign to “neutralise the negative image of milkfat among regulators and health professionals as related to heart disease,” the American Heart Association is explicit about our need to cut down on dairy fat (and coconut oil and meat) to reduce the risk of our number one killer.3402,3403 The American Heart Association put out a special Presidential Advisory in 2017 to clearly “set the record straight on why well-conducted scientific research overwhelmingly supports limiting saturated fat in the diet.”

Drink Hibiscus Tea

Flower Power

Hibiscus tea, also known as roselle or Jamaica, is enjoyed around the world, hot or cold, for its bright red color and tart cranberry-like flavor. It’s the “zing” in Red Zinger tea. I talk about its benefits in the chapter on high blood pressure in How Not to Die, working as well as,3405 or even beating out, some antihypertensive medications in head-to-head tests.3406

Within three hours of drinking hibiscus tea, one hundred different metabolites can be detected in the human bloodstream.3407 Alterations in gene expression at the three-hour mark suggest an improvement in metabolism and a downregulation of cholesterol synthesis, but randomized controlled trials have failed to consistently find cholesterol-lowering benefits.3408 An interesting side effect did pop up, though: weight loss.3409

In Mexico, hibiscus tea has been used traditionally for the treatment of obesity, sparking lots of research interest.3410 Computer modeling studies have suggested that certain hibiscus compounds might bind to the fat-digesting enzyme lipase like a key in a lock.3411 (Uncreative names of compounds found from the flower include hibiscin, hibiscitrin, hibiscetin, and hibiscus acid.3412) Test-tube studies screening a variety of medicinal plants did indeed find that hibiscus inhibited lipase more than the others,3413 and hibiscus has been found to reduce body fat in hamsters,3414 mice,3415 and rats, increasing fecal fat excretion.3416 However it wasn’t tested in people until recently.

To design a randomized double-blind trial, instead of trying to create an artificially colored and flavored placebo tea, the researchers dried the hibiscus tea into a powder and put it into capsules. After twelve weeks, there was a greater reduction in waistlines and body-fat percentage in the hibiscus group compared to those who got placebo capsules,3417 but the dose they used was the equivalent of nine cups of hibiscus tea a day.3418 I recommend people stick to no more than a quart a day on a regular basis due to the high manganese content. (Manganese is an essential trace mineral, but nine cups a day might result in too much of a good thing.3419)

Finally, in 2018, a study was published using a reasonable dose—the equivalent of about a single twelve-ounce glass of tea a day. The complicating factor is that the researchers also added lemon verbena to the mix. That’s another herbal tea, better known for improving recovery after intense bouts of strength training,3420 but there were some promising in vitro data on effects of lemon verbena on fat cells in a petri dish,3421 so they tried a combination. The dose came out to be about a cup and a half of hibiscus tea3422 and a quarter cup of lemon verbena tea3423 once a day for two months.3424

Both the tea and placebo groups were prescribed diets containing the same number of calories, yet those randomized to the tea group lost significantly more weight—eight pounds compared to five. That’s only an extra pound a month, but an extra pound a month on a same-calorie diet.3425 That’s the advantage of fat-blocking interventions that actually cause you to lose more calories: Beyond reducing hunger, they can make you feel fuller for longer in hopes that you’ll subsequently eat fewer calories.

Why not just pop pills instead of brewing tea? There are all sorts of herbal extract supplements on the market, but do we know enough to extract out the right active ingredients? For example, it does not appear to be the red anthocyanin pigments in hibiscus, since white varieties seemed to have similar effects.3426 When the various compounds in hibiscus tea are isolated out and tested in various combinations, synergistic effects are found, meaning the whole may be greater than the sum of its parts.3427

Other than my manganese caveat, the only potential downside of hibiscus tea is the effect it can have on our tooth enamel if we’re not careful. As with any sour food or beverage, like after eating citrus, it’s important to wash the natural acids off your teeth by rinsing out your mouth with water to protect your teeth.3428 You also want to wait at least an hour before brushing so as not to erode your enamel when it’s in a softened state.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

The best source of the fat-blocking agents thylakoids and calcium is low-oxalate, dark green leafy vegetables, meaning essentially all greens except spinach, beet greens, and swiss chard. To be clear, I encourage everyone to eat huge amounts of dark leafy greens every day, the healthiest food on the planet. Greens answer the question: What if the food with the lowest calorie content also had the highest nutrient content? But if you follow this advice (and you should!), then just choose any of the other wonderful greens. If you eat mere-mortal amounts of greens (like a serving a day), then it doesn’t matter which type of dark green leafy you choose. I continue to enjoy spinach, beet greens, and chard all the time. It’s just that you can overdo those three. To make sure I don’t end up consuming more than a serving or two a day of the high-oxalate ones when I’m trying to hit my pound-a-day green leafy quota, I personally do mostly kale, collards, and arugula, which also happen to have the added benefit of being cruciferocious. And you can enjoy it with a cup of hibiscus tea for added zing.

Those same thermoreceptors in our skin are also found in our intestines.3494 No, you don’t have to eat a brain-freezing Slurpee. There are dietary, as well as temperature, triggers. Unfortunately, most of the studies on food components that can activate brown fat or turn white fat beige were only performed in petri dishes or lab animals. These include studies involving beets,3495 broccoli,3496 grapes,3497 greens,3498 olives,3499 omega-3s,3500 onions,3501 raspberries,3502 rose hips,3503 soybeans,3504 and turmeric, but so far, none of these has been shown to activate BAT in humans.3505 In ironic contrast to the cold, one of the first foods to pass the test was hot peppers.


Chili Peppers

Capsaicin, the pungent compound in chili peppers that gives them their heat, fits like a lock-and-key into the thermoreceptors that lead to the activation of brown fat.3506 Studies have investigated the “antiobesity effects” of “Tabasco hot sauce in rats,”3507 and according to some population studies, those who eat spicier foods tend to gain less weight. This has led researchers to conclude that “regular and higher chilli consumption may provide a low cost and simple strategy to reduce the incidence of overweight and obesity.”3508 But you don’t really know until you start feeding people some peppers.

Remember how you can point a thermography camera at someone and see the area above their collarbones light up when you plunge their extremities into ice water as their brown fat revs up? The same happens if you skip the ice and just feed people a chili pepper extract.3509 If you give people 2 mg of purified capsaicin, which is about what you’d find in a jalapeño pepper3510 or a half teaspoon of red pepper powder,3511 you can potentially increase the rate at which they burn calories by up to 150 calories a day.3512

The reason we know this metabolic boost is from the ignition of brown fat is because capsaicin-like compounds only seem to work in people with active BAT deposits.3513 Even if yours are lying dormant, cold can not only light up the brown fat you have but also recruit its formation in the first place—and chili peppers appear to do the same thing.3514 Eight weeks of consuming chili pepper extracts boosted both BAT activity and density by almost 50 percent.3515 Even just six weeks of taking in chili pepper compounds can so bulk up our BAT that we can get a tenfold increase in cold-induced heat generation.3516 The researchers concluded that their findings could contribute to “developing practical, easy, and effective antiobesity regimens.”3517 These studies used straight capsaicin or purified extracts so they could hide it in a pill to pit them head-to-head against sugar pill placebos. What about using the whole pepper?

Normally, diet-induced thermogenesis—the extra calories you burn after a meal to digest it—just bumps up your metabolic rate by about 10 percent. Add some red pepper powder to that meal, however, and you can bump up the rate at which you burn calories immediately afterward by more like 30 percent.3518 The original pepper powder studies were done in Japan, though, where men3519 and women3520 happily sprinkled two tablespoons of red pepper powder onto a meal, so people with less affinity for spice might not find it as nice.


Some Like It Hot

Chili pepper may be one of the world’s most popular spices, but it’s enjoyed more in some places than others.3521 In Mexico, for example, studies consider anyone eating less than the equivalent of three jalapeño peppers per day as “low-level consumers,” whereas high consumers averaged nine to twenty-five jalapeño peppers’ worth of capsaicin daily.3522 In contrast, in the United States, only about one in ten individuals eats peppers of any kind on a daily basis.3523 So researchers in Indiana sought to determine if a red pepper dose “hedonically acceptable” to Americans would still have an effect.

Instead of two tablespoons, the researchers tried ten times less—about a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper—and mixed it into tomato soup. Over the next four and a half hours, those who had eaten the spicy tomato soup burned about ten more calories than those who had had the unspiced soup.3524 Since cayenne has essentially zero calories, the spicy group ended up with a relative calorie debt, but ten measly calories is hardly anything to write home about. But that’s not the end of the story.

Two years later, a study was published in the Netherlands that reignited interest in the use of chili peppers for weight loss. The researchers started by cutting everyone’s caloric intake by 20 percent, which is typical for those on portion-controlled diets. It’s the equivalent of removing 500 calories out of a 2,500-calorie day. Your body doesn’t like that and tries to compensate, for example, by slowing your sleeping metabolic rate. So, in reality, cutting 20 percent of calories only results in a 16 percent calorie deficit. You may have cut out 500 calories, but since your body is able to make some of that up by slowing your metabolism enough to burn 100 fewer calories, you end up only being down 400 calories by the next morning. The study subjects then were randomized into one of two groups: those who got capsules containing one-half teaspoon of cayenne pepper with each meal or those who got placebos.3525

Both groups had 20 percent of calories cut from their diets, but while the bodies of those in the placebo group successfully compensated that reduction down to only a 16 percent deficit, those who had unknowingly ingested the cayenne experienced the full 20 percent drop. The red pepper powder counteracted the body’s attempts to ratchet down the metabolism to slow the weight loss. Indeed, the cayenne group woke up the next morning with nineteen fewer grams of body fat, whereas the placebo group had only lost fourteen.3526 That’s about a thick pat of butter’s worth of difference, which may not seem like much on any given day, but could add up over time. A study where researchers openly sprinkled red pepper onto people’s meals—in tomato juice for breakfast and then in pâté and pizza—experienced a similar benefit.


Fire in the Belly

A meta-analysis of studies on capsaicin, whether in extract or pepper form, found that overweight individuals burned, on average, about an extra seventy calories a day compared to those in the control groups.3528 At the same time, taking capsaicin-like compounds before a meal may actually decrease caloric intake, so it may help from both sides of the energy-balance equation.3529 No wonder capsaicin has been referred to in the medical literature as an “anti-obesity drug,”3530 a “spicy solution to the management of obesity.”3531 But does it work long term?

The supplement data are mixed. Some randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials using pepper extracts found a benefit in terms of significantly enhanced loss of abdominal fat over time,3532 but others did not.3533 Even if the extracts the researchers used contained the right mixture of active ingredients, it’s possible some of the effect is mediated by nerve signals coming off our tongues or stomachs.3534 This would explain why capsaicin supplements that do not dissolve and open up until they’re well into the intestine don’t appear to work as well.3535 However, findings from the whole pepper powder studies are inconsistent too.

In an Australian study, where participants were switched between bland and spicy diets, the subjects didn’t lose any relative weight in the month they had been adding chili powder to their meals.3536 A subsequent study in Korea, however, did find a benefit. CT scans revealed significant reductions in visceral fat among those randomized to use Korean chili paste (kochujang, a signature component of bibimbap) compared to a placebo paste that evidently looked, tasted, and smelled the same, but had no actual peppers. To accomplish this, however, the researchers had to manipulate the ratios of some of the other ingredients in the placebo paste, such as the salt and soybeans, so other factors may have crept in. Study duration may have also played a role. The twelve-week Korean study lasted three times longer than the Australian study, perhaps allowing time for BAT levels to ramp up sufficiently.3537

A nice thing about studies on healthy foods is that even if there are conflicting data about the specific benefits for a particular malady, these foods are by definition healthful. So, with no downsides, I figure you might as well give them a try. But is that the case for chili peppers? Capsaicin has been put to the test as an ergogenic (performance-enhancing) aid and appears to help both with running performance3538 and strength training,3539 but what about effects on chronic disease? Do people who eat red hot chili peppers live longer?

Apparently so. The diets of more than sixteen thousand people across the United States were tracked for nearly twenty years. Over that time, one in three passed away—but they were among those who reported they did not eat chili peppers. Over that same period, only one in five chili-pepper eaters died.3540 That’s significantly lower overall mortality, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the peppers had anything to do with it.

Remember the Hispanic paradox3541 I discussed in the Rich in Legumes section, where despite having on average less education, a higher poverty rate, and worse access to health care,3542 Hispanics and Latinos in the United States have a 24 percent lower risk of premature death compared to Caucasians?3543 That translates into Hispanic men and women living about seven years longer than non-Hispanic black Americans and three years longer than non-Hispanic white Americans.3544 Latino longevity has been chalked up to their eating up to four to five times more beans,3545 which have been a staple among all the longest-living populations in the world3546 and have been called “the most important dietary predictor of survival.”3547 Is it possible that chilis are just being added more often to beans than burgers, and that explains the apparent pepper protection?

Apparently not. The chili pepper longevity study controlled for race and ethnicity, and adjusted for other dietary factors, such as fruit, vegetable, and meat intake, as well as income, education, alcohol, and exercise.3548 A similar study in China that followed hundreds of thousands of individuals confirmed that those who eat spicy food more frequently do appear to lower their risk of premature death, attributed to the “anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive effects of spicy foods.”3549

As the saying goes, good peppers burn twice, but are burning our butts or freezing our bodies our only two options for boosting brown fat? Thankfully, there are a variety of structurally similar flavor molecules in other foods that can go to BAT for us.

Peppermint
What about a cooling compound like the menthol in mint? The same receptor in the body that is activated by cold temperatures is also activated by menthol.3582 Studies on fat biopsies taken from people during surgery discovered that these cold receptors are found on our fat cells. What’s more, when they are activated by menthol, they can be “browned” into burning fat in a petri dish.3583 This discovery led to the 2016 proposition that chronic, menthol-induced browning “could provide a promising novel therapeutic approach for increasing energy expenditure, regulating body weight, and preventing obesity.”3584

It works in mice.3585 Mimicking long-term cold exposure with dietary menthol can prevent obesity in rodents. What about in us? While giving people more than ten cups of peppermint tea’s worth of menthol a day didn’t appear to significantly raise their metabolic rate, rubbing the same amount on their skin did.3586 Our livers rapidly modify the menthol we eat to remove it from the body. The tobacco industry found a not-so-Kool way to skirt the liver by selling menthol cigarettes to provide a purported edge in weight control,3587 but topical application may have a similar effect, allowing more menthol to circulate throughout the body before getting metabolized. Research subjects who applied a gel that contained about a half teaspoon of peppermint essential oil’s worth of menthol got a significant rise in resting metabolic rate within hours.3588

Menthol had been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years before the menthol receptors in our bodies were discovered.3589 The reason sports injuries are often iced is to reduce the swelling by reducing blood flow to the area. When our skin is exposed to cold, our bodies clamp down on blood flow to prevent heat loss, and the same happens when we apply menthol. Researchers found that applying about three-quarters of a teaspoon of a 3.5 percent menthol gel on someone’s forearm can reduce blood flow as much as applying a cold pack of crushed ice. Not only was the menthol less uncomfortable than the ice pack,3590 it has also been shown to work better in reducing muscle soreness after a tough workout.3591

Topical menthol has also been found to work for chronic pain (carpal tunnel syndrome in slaughterhouse workers3592) and migraine sufferers (rubbed on the forehead and temple of the affected side3593), but what about weight loss? It works in rats.3594 Rub rodents with menthol, and their metabolic rates go up and they gain less weight. Unfortunately, it has never been tested in people. If you want to give it a try, menthol concentrations up to 16 percent are considered safe for topical application.3595 Since peppermint essential oil is comprised of one-third to one-half pure menthol,3596 you could safely add a tablespoon to a quarter cup of your favorite hand lotion or massage oil. Allergic reactions or skin irritation to menthol is rare,3597 and no serious adverse effects have been filed with the FDA.3598 However, that is not the case with other “cooling” chemicals such as methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen) or camphor (found in products like Bengay and Tiger Balm), which can cause serious, even life-threatening, reactions when used improperly.3599 So I advise you to stick to menthol-only preparations.

Any other herbs out there with potential?

Tea

Brewing Evidence

Simply drink a cup of tea, and, within an hour, you may be burning up to 10 percent more calories.3619 Drink four cups of tea in the twenty-four hours before a thirty-minute walk, and you burn an extra gram of fat during your half-hour stroll.3620 Take about ten cups’ worth in the form of green tea extract supplements the day before thirty minutes of cycling, and burn an extra two grams of fat.3621 So is this just from the caffeine naturally found in tea, or is something else at work?

Researchers randomized people to one of three groups: getting either the equivalent of a cup of tea with every meal, just the amount of caffeine in the tea, or a placebo with neither tea nor caffeine. The caffeine alone didn’t seem to have any effect, but having tea three times a day raised the number of calories burned in that twenty-four-hour period from about 2,280 to 2,360, around 80 calories more.3622 And tea without anything added has practically zero calories, so based on these findings, tea may be thought to have “negative” calories. In effect, each cup of tea swept away about 25 calories.

Interventional studies putting around three to six cups’ worth of daily green or oolong tea to the test showed an average metabolic boost of about one hundred calories a day, shaving off three butter pats’ worth of extra fat every day.3623 Tea only seems to work half as well as ephedra,3624 but unlike the drug, tea hasn’t chalked up eighteen thousand cases of adverse events or killed any professional baseball players.3625

Although more than two thousand compounds have been identified in tea leaves, most attention has been paid to a family of antioxidants called catechins, such as EGCG.3626 This is because even straight EGCG has been shown to boost metabolism and the rate at which fat is burned at rest.3627 That is one reason most of the spotlight has been on green, white, and oolong teas, as they have about five times more EGCG than black tea.3628

Originally, we thought this stimulant effect was due to tea compounds keying up our metabolisms by inhibiting an enzyme that degrades adrenaline in the body.3629 This was based largely on test-tube studies, though, using EGCG concentrations higher than what you might expect to reach in your bloodstream.3630 Green tea can boost metabolism without raising heart rate3631 and, if anything, reduces blood pressure a bit—both of which are inconsistent with an adrenaline rush.3632 Indeed, when put to the test in people, the adrenaline-eating enzyme wasn’t suppressed after all,3633 calling the whole theory into question.3634 More likely, what’s causing this reaction is the BAT signal.

A brown fat effect could help explain the variability in weight-loss responses. In one study, for example, overweight women randomized to about a half teaspoon of green tea powder a day lost an average of twelve pounds more than the placebo group over eight weeks. But, even the twelve-pound difference didn’t reach statistical significance because there was such a wide range of responses.3635 Could it be that some individuals started out with more brown fat than others? In a petri dish, tea compounds like EGCG can induce the browning of white fat cells to beige3636 and green tea extracts have been shown to reduce shivering under cold conditions,3637 but BAT activation from tea wasn’t proven until 2016.

Like cold and capsaicin, tea only acutely boosted metabolism in those with active BAT deposits,3638 and furthermore, could recruit the formation3639 and activation of additional brown fat over time.3640 It didn’t work as well as some of the cold experiments, but drinking tea, the researchers concluded, may be an “easier and more convenient treatment than chronic cold exposure.”3641 But does it get us to lose weight?


Choose Unleaded

China burns about half of the world’s coal, spewing toxic heavy metals such as mercury and lead into the atmosphere. Even if you don’t live in China or eat any food produced there, you could still be exposed to mercury that settles in the oceans if you eat fish and other seafood, or be exposed to lead if you drink something from China: tea.3642

Beyond the mercury from its coal plants to its tea plants, China didn’t ban leaded gasoline until the year 2000, which is reflected in the fact that lead levels on Chinese tea plantations are highest closest to highways.3643 How can you limit your exposure? Just as longer-living fish accumulate more mercury, longer-living leaves accumulate more lead.3644

Young tea leaves appear to have two to six times less lead than mature leaves,3645 so the younger leaves that are used to make green tea and white tea have significantly less lead than the older leaves used to make black and oolong teas. Furthermore, the lead in black and oolong teas appears to be released much more readily into tea water when brewed. Only 7 percent of the lead in green tea leaves leaches into hot water, compared to more than half in the darker varieties. Combining all these factors, the health risk from heavy metals is approximately one hundred times lower for green tea compared to oolong and black.3646

Since certain fungicides may have heavy metal impurities, one might assume organic teas would be less contaminated,3647 but in a study of thirty common teas off North American store shelves, there did not seem to be less toxic element contamination in organic versus conventional tea.3648 In terms of lead, the country of origin may be the most important factor. Based on the most stringent safety limits in the world,3649 such as California’s Proposition 65 parameters, and the largest studies of tea leaf contamination in two of the largest tea-exporting countries, this is what I was able to come up with

Safe Level of Tea Consumption

If you’re not pregnant and just drinking green tea, from a lead standpoint, it doesn’t matter where you source your tea. Given the average levels of lead in Chinese black tea samples, however, more than three cups a day would exceed the most conservative daily safety limits for lead. That’s if you’re just drinking brewed tea and throwing away the tea leaves or tea bag. If you’re actually eating the leaves, like drinking powdered green (matcha) tea or throwing tea leaves into your smoothie like I do, I wouldn’t use more than two or three heaping teaspoons a day unless your tea is sourced from Japan. The parenthetical numbers in the chart indicate caution only from a standpoint of caffeine limit, rather than that of any sort of contamination.

If you’re the weight of an average ten-year-old, lead still isn’t a problem when drinking green tea, but the safe caffeine intake for children is more restrictive. I wouldn’t add more than two spoonfuls of Japanese green tea to a child’s smoothie due to the caffeine or more than one spoonful of Chinese green tea because of the lead. Similarly, I wouldn’t like to see children drinking more than one cup of black tea a day and wouldn’t want them eating the leaves at all.

Pregnant women should be able to drink a cup a day of green tea throughout pregnancy, regardless of source, based on average tea lead levels. The cap for Japanese green tea is really just the suggested American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology’s 200 mg per day caffeine limit.3651 I wouldn’t recommend drinking black tea during pregnancy at all, though, or eating any kind of tea leaves unless you know you’re getting tea from a low-lead source.

However, after putting all the weight-loss studies together, meta-analyses seem split between statistically insignificant weight loss3657 or clinically insignificant weight loss, an average of about three pounds over twelve weeks.3658 Green tea seems less magic bullet and more BB gun pellet, but a pound a month may be worth it for something that’s healthy anyway. After nearly five thousand years of tea drinking,3659 science has finally caught up and shown green tea can lower cholesterol3660 and prevent colon polyps.3661 You can even gargle with it to help prevent the flu.3662 And a meta-analysis of observational studies where tea-drinking populations were followed over time shows consumption of green or black tea is associated with living a significantly longer life.


What About Green Tea Extract Supplements?

A head-to-head comparison between brewed green tea and green tea extract supplements found a similar amount of weight loss over the control group over an eight-week period.3664 Those randomized to drink the tea lost six pounds, while those randomized to take the supplements lost four pounds, so why not just take the pills? First of all, because the supplement industry is so poorly regulated, you never know what you’re getting. There are supplements on the market that list green tea as an ingredient on the label, but when tested, didn’t appear to contain any at all.3665 Even if supplements are labeled accurately, the fillers may bind to the active components and reduce bioavailability,3666 or the capsule shell may not disintegrate properly.3667 This may help explain why, in cholesterol-lowering trials, for example, green tea in beverage form worked, but green tea in supplement form did not.3668 More concerning, though, are the side effects.

Twelve years ago, when I first started producing videos about cases of liver toxicity tied to green tea extract supplements, it was thought to be rare, on the order of one in one hundred thousand.3669 Now that we have large studies like the Minnesota Green Tea Trial, we realize it may be more like one in twenty. In contrast, not a single liver problem has been reported in any of the trials that used green tea in regular beverage form.3670 Even in Japan, where nine cups a day is not uncommon,3671 adverse effects have not been reported.3672 An incredible five billion kilos of tea are produced worldwide annually, enough for more than two trillion cups of tea a year.3673 I think we’d know if just drinking tea could cause liver issues.

Another problem with supplements may be the dose.3674 Some studies used extract supplement regimens equivalent to drinking more than forty cups of tea a day.3675 To be on the safe side, I recommend enjoying tea in beverage—not pill—form. I encourage people to stay away from green tea extract supplements, but if you do take them, please stick to less than 300 mg EGCG a day3676 and stop immediately if you develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice).

Not Milk?

Both green and black teas have been shown to improve artery function within hours of consumption.3678 Why then in population studies is green tea consumption associated with lower heart disease risk than black tea?3679 In two British studies, in fact, tea consumption was associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease.3680,3681 Is it because Brits tend to drink their tea with milk, whereas green tea is typically taken straight? If only there were a country that drank black tea, but without milk. There is—the Netherlands. And in those studies, black tea was associated with the same drop in risk as the green tea studies.3682,3683 So maybe it has something to do with the milk.

Researchers found the addition of milk “completely prevents the biological activity of tea.”3684 Both the artery function benefits and the thermogenic calorie-burning effects were inhibited by casein, a protein in milk that apparently wraps itself about the catechins and blocks their function.3685 (Interestingly, this is presumably the same mechanism by which adding milk to tea can reduce teeth staining.3686) Milk protein also undercuts the benefits of berries,3687 chocolate,3688 and coffee.3689

What about soy milk? In a test tube, coffee phytonutrients bind not only to dairy proteins but also to egg and soy proteins.3690 Eggs haven’t been put to the test in people, so we don’t know yet if having an omelet with black coffee would impair absorption, but soy has been given the all-clear.3691 Soy proteins do initially bind up the coffee compounds in the small intestine, but then our good bacteria release them so they can be absorbed down in the lower intestine.3692 Almond-, rice-, oat-, and coconut-based milks have so little protein that I’d assume binding would not be a problem, but they have yet to be directly tested.

When the original milk-blocking study on tea was published, the European Society of Cardiology suggested people consider skipping the creamer, noting the protective cardiovascular effects are “totally wiped out by adding milk.”3693 This advice did not go over well. “As doctors,” read one letter to the medical journal editor, “we would not prescribe a new drug to patients if it was studied only in one small study. In analogy, milk abstinence should not be recommended to tea drinkers on the basis of evidence of similar strength.”3694 The researchers replied that the effect was so great—milk didn’t just reduce the benefit but “completely blunted the effects of tea”—that they didn’t need to do a large study.3695 As far as I’m concerned, the reason we don’t prescribe drugs without overwhelming evidence is that drugs can kill. In fact, prescription drugs kill an estimated 106,000 Americans every year,3696 so the benefits better outweigh the risks. But what’s the downside of a little milk abstinence?

Try not to drink coffee. But if you do, drink one cup in the morning, no sugar, no milk.

We used to think as long as you didn’t drink caffeine in the evening, it wouldn’t affect sleep, but having the equivalent of four cups of coffee up to even six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by more than an hour.3735 Even just two cups at 7:00 a.m. can change what our brain waves look like on EEG later that night,3736 indicative of shallower sleep.3737 It’s not clear, however, if this has any clinical relevance beyond delaying the onset of sleep by an average of ten minutes.3738 On balance and on average, coffee consumption is more often associated with benefits than harms.

What About Energy Drinks?

If caffeine can help burn fat, what about energy drinks? The first energy drink—Dr. Enuf—dates back more than a half century, launched in 1949. Today, there are more than one hundred different brands3740 fueling a $50 billion industry.3741 Some military leaders have questioned their safety,3742 based in part on the skyrocketing number of energy drink–related visits to the ER over recent years.3743 To be fair, though, if you look at some of the reports, you’ll see cases like this: A 24-year-old male didn’t feel well after drinking a can of energy drink … and “3 bottles of vodka.”3744 Because energy drinks are often co-consumed with other substances like alcohol, it’s hard to specify the culprit.3745 That’s why you have to put them to the test.

One concern that has been raised by public health advocates is increased blood pressure.3746 If you have people chug a can of Red Bull, there’s no significant change in blood pressure thirty minutes later.3747 Okay, but that was just the little eight-ounce can. What about the big sixteen-ounce cans of Red Bull? Forty minutes after drinking one of those, there was still no significant change, so concerns about energy drinks raising blood pressure were dismissed as overblown3748 … until the bomb dropped in 2014.

Red Bull did indeed significantly raise blood pressure after all. The reason the earlier studies missed it is because the spike doesn’t start peaking until about an hour after consumption. And the big shocker was that blood flow in the brain took a dive. These energy drinks are promoted as having beneficial effects, but this instead suggests they’re potentially harmful because of the extra workload they force on the heart and the decreased cerebral blood flow.3749

Other adverse effects of Red Bull have been found, such an increased inflammation,3750 and that goes for other brands like Rockstar3751 and Monster energy drinks too.3752 Is it possible it’s just the caffeine? Is downing an energy drink any different from having a cup of coffee? To figure that out, a study was conducted in 2017 that compared the effects of an energy drink with a plain drink with the exact same amount of caffeine.

Young, healthy volunteers were randomized to drink two large cans of either an energy drink or a control drink that had the same amount of sugar and caffeine but none of the other proprietary blend ingredients common in energy drinks, such as taurine, carnitine, ginseng, and guarana. It turns out it was not just the caffeine. Significantly higher blood pressures were noted on the energy drink, along with a longer “QT interval,” which is an EKG finding corresponding to the time it takes for the heart to contract and then refill with blood before beginning its next beat. QT prolongation—which is what the energy drink did, but not the caffeine alone—is a recognized marker of increased risk for developing a sudden fatal heart rhythm.3753

Prolongation of the QT interval by more than sixty milliseconds is a marker for life-threatening arrhythmias. Though the energy drink only prolonged it by about ten milliseconds, there have been drugs pulled from the market—profitable drugs bringing in billions of dollars—because of a five- to ten-millisecond prolongation. The researchers suggested we need to start investigating some of these other ingredients in energy drinks.3754 Case in point: Authorities once found cocaine in Red Bull, though the manufacturers insisted that they were just adding the coca leaf for “flavor.”

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Everything we eat and drink can be grouped into one of four categories:
Most of what we consume fits into the upper-right corner, foods that provide both nutrition and calories, but some offer calories without any nutrition, like candy. Others, like artificial sweeteners, offer neither nutrition nor calories. Then there’s a fourth category: nutrition without calories. That’s where tea comes in, along with many spices. So imagine making a spicy chai with green tea, ginger, and cinnamon. You’d be nailing three fat burners in just one cup.

Note that premenopausal women or anyone at risk for iron-deficiency anemia ideally should not drink tea within an hour of meals to minimize tea’s impact on reducing iron absorption.3756

Another option is to try feeling hot! hot! hot! by spicing up your meals with chili peppers or hot sauces. (You can even add red pepper flakes to your favorite chai tea.) Then you can cool yourself down by lowering your thermostat in the winter for a money-saving, carbon-friendly way to try to burn off some extra fat. A peppermint lotion foot rub may or may not help, too, but it’ll feel good either way.

HABIT FORMATION

Force of Habit

When people were asked to estimate how many food-related decisions they make every day—what to eat, when to eat, where, and how much—most pick a number under twenty. When they were asked to carry around a counter and click each such food choice made over the course of a day, the actual number was more than two hundred.3757 We may make hundreds of decisions about food every day, yet the vast majority appear to pass under our conscious radars. They happen almost automatically, without cognizant reflection, deliberation, or even awareness.3758 We may be able to take advantage of this mindless eating, though, by harnessing the power of habit formation.

It’s been said that “most of the time what we do is what we do most of the time.”3759 Many of our eating habits are indeed just that—habitual. And the busier we are and the more distracted we are, the more likely we are to fall back on habits.3760 That’s what they’re there for. Habits are like reflexive subroutines our brains use as mechanisms to free up our mental resources. That can work against us, in the case of bad habits, or for us, in the case of good ones. Imagine if you had to add “buckle seat belt” to your to-do list every day. Maybe put a sticky-note reminder on your dashboard or tie a string around your car keys? If you’re in the habit of buckling up, though, your hand will start reaching for the seat belt without you even knowing.

Once you do something long enough, your brain commits the actions to memory and can whip them out at will to automate away some of your cognitive workload—and the automation happens automatically. The mere repetition of a simple action in a consistent context ultimately leads to the action being activated upon exposure to that same situation.3761 Do it enough times, and getting into a car (contextual cue) can automatically lead to reaching for the seat belt (action).3762

Habits are defined as “learned behavioral responses to situational cues,”3763 so there are two parts—the cue and the action. The cue can be in any context—for example, an event (such as arriving at work), a time (after breakfast), a location (in the car), or even a mood (anxious).3764 It just has to be something salient that is frequently and consistently encountered in daily life.3765 Do something over and over again in the same context—whether intentionally or unintentionally—and a habit can form.3766

How long does it take? You may have heard that habits take twenty-one days to form. That’s a myth that evidently originated from anecdotal evidence of how long it takes plastic surgery patients to psychologically adjust to their new appearance.3767 When it was actually put to the test, the average time to reach automaticity was sixty-six days. Study volunteers were asked to choose an eating, drinking, or activity behavior to carry out each day in the same context. Examples chosen included “eating a piece of fruit with lunch,” “drinking a bottle of water with lunch,” and “running for 15 minutes before dinner.” There was considerable variation in the time it took for these actions to become automatic, from 18 days to 284 days, but the average was 66.3768 That might seem like a long time, but be reassured that it does get progressively easier with time, and you only have to maintain your motivation until the habit forms. After that, you’re golden. It’s like uploading a new piece of software into your brain for a built-in, lifelong body hack.

The magic of habits lies in their persistence even after losing conscious motivation or interest. They just become second nature. You don’t have to worry about them anymore. Health can happen effortlessly.


Breaking Bad … Habits

Of course, bad habits can also form. The first time you snacked in front of the TV at night, you may have been genuinely hungry, but over time, the two activities can become indelibly linked such that your prime-time shows trigger snack cravings even if you’re not really in the mood to eat. It can become something you can’t help—in other words, a bad habit.3769 In one oft-cited study, people in the habit of eating popcorn in the movie theater were asked why.3770 Most gave some variation of the answer “it tastes good.” Seems reasonable, but then why did they end up eating the same amount when they were given stale, week-old popcorn they “decidedly disliked”? Put people who aren’t habituated in the same scenario, and they eat more of the fresh popcorn and less of the stale,3771 but strong habits can perpetuate independently of the intentions or consequences of your behavior.3772

There are two ways to break a bad habit: change the cue, or change the action. The most straightforward approach is to try to avoid the situational triggers.3773 Recovering alcoholics and drug addicts know all too well the power of social or environmental cues to prompt cravings and relapses. That may be the reason some people find it easier to quit smoking when they’re traveling or otherwise removed from their typical everyday circumstances.3774 So anytime we can remove ourselves from triggering situations—by walking a different route to work to avoid the donut shop, for instance—we can capitalize on contextual changes to avoid the habitual call-and-response.3775

In the popcorn study, when the habituated eaters were moved out of the cinema to instead watch videos in a conference room, the spell was broken. Without the same contextual cues, their actions were released from habitual control, and they, too, pushed away the stale popcorn. That’s the first way to break a habit: Block its activation. The other way is to block its execution. In the popcorn study, this was accomplished by surreptitiously forcing the habituated eaters to eat with their nondominant hand.3776

There they were, seated in the theater with a bucket of popcorn, so their reflexive response to mindlessly eat even stale popcorn was triggered. Just by having to eat it with their other hand, however, was enough to disrupt the subroutine and regain intentional control.3777 Change the cue, or change the action. We can block either a habit’s initiation or its fluid implementation.

The researchers went as far as to suggest that dieters “actively disrupt the execution of the activated eating sequence by simple manipulations such as eating with the nondominant hand and, in so doing, bring their eating under their personal control.”3778 But do that manipulation long enough and it, too, will become a habit. Junk from the left is just as fattening as junk from the right. A better strategy would be to form new habits of healthy eating.


Change the Cue

Health-wise, it matters little what we eat on birthdays, holidays, or special occasions (unless for you every day is National Hot Dog Day). It’s the day-to-day that adds up, which is why our eating habits are so important, for good or for ill.3779 Our food choices may start out planned and purposeful but can morph into well-worn tracks over time, and we can become stuck in the rut. There is a tendency for habits to continue regardless of our intentions.3780 This may be why just knowing the right thing to do often isn’t enough.

Knowledge is power, but it may not be powerful enough on its own to break a habit. Historically, anti-smoking campaigns have been successful in making people aware of the dangers of cigarettes, but they were not very effective in and of themselves in getting people to quit. Media interventions to reduce youth substance abuse may have even backfired. A meta-analysis of more than one hundred papers showed knowledge and attitudes improved, but the information campaigns appeared to actually increase youth drug use.3781

Habits are propensities to repeat behaviors given the recurring circumstances.3782 As habits form, deliberate decision-making recedes by design and is replaced by these reflexive circuits within our brains. The strength of habits, however, is also its weakness. The dependence of habits on contextual triggers renders them vulnerable to modification.3783

Just like smokers trying to quit can remove from sight all their ashtrays, we can try to get rid of all the junk from our pantries.3784 If you’re used to having a cookie every time you see the cookie jar, it might be better to replace it with a fruit bowl. Strategies like packing healthy snacks to go can help shift our immediate surroundings to become more conducive to healthy choices. To change all our habits at once, though, we can try exploiting major life events, such as a change in living arrangements.

Public health campaigners try to take advantage of this by targeting those experiencing natural shifts in their lives, like when they start a new job.3785 A study of personal accounts of successful versus failed attempts at major life changes found that altering one’s immediate environment or moving to an entirely different location appeared to help.3786 When our existing habits are disrupted, this offers an opportunity to start anew, but you don’t have to relocate to start fresh. You can change your existing bad habits to good ones, or establish new good habits from scratch, using a technique known as implementation intentions.

How to Get Teenagers to Change

Millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on the D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program to get teens to just say no to drugs3787 until the U.S. General Accounting Office publicized the fact that all the studies that had been done to evaluate its impact showed it had “no statistically significant long-term effect on preventing youth illicit drug use.”3788

It’s hard enough to get adults already beset with chronic disease to live healthier. How can we possibly motivate teenagers, who feel invincible and for whom concepts like lung cancer and heart disease are nebulous notions better fit for a grandparental purview?

The classic challenge facing public health efforts is to figure out how to counter the temptation of the immediate reward with the hope of distant future health benefits. This is particularly difficult in the adolescent age group, so much so that leading experts in teen development have said things such as, “Classroom-based health education is an uphill battle against evolution and endocrinology, and it is not a fight we are likely to win.”3789 A landmark study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences entitled “Harnessing Adolescent Values to Motivate Healthier Eating” broke through the defeatist pessimism by first starting with a question: What motivates teens?3790

If you were going to design educational materials to get teens to freely choose baby carrots over Cheetos, what would you do? One of the reasons it’s so difficult to convince teenagers to take better care of themselves is that they are extremely sensitive to perceived encroachments on their autonomy. They seek independence from parents and other authority figures telling them what to do—so the researchers sought to turn this obstacle into an asset. They developed a healthy eating message framed as an exposé of manipulative food industry marketing practices designed to deceive. They talked about how Big Food scientists use sophisticated, industrial techniques to maximize product craveability using salt, sugar, fat, and other flavor additives. The goal was to portray healthy eating as a way to rebel and “stick it to the man.”3791

The other commonly shared value they tapped into was a concern about injustice. Teens are often stereotyped as self-centered, but anyone who’s worked with them can attest to their sensitivity to unfairness and inequity. So the researchers talked about how the food industry disproportionately targets poor communities and young children with ads for some of their unhealthiest products. Avoiding junk food was presented as a way to take a stand for social justice.

In theory, these two avenues eliminate the need to think about long-term consequences, instead offering immediate symbolic benefit in terms of stoking their rebellious spirits and acting in accordance with their deeply held beliefs. Or at least that’s the theory. To test it, researchers set up a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled experiment with more than five hundred eighth graders. They were allocated randomly to one of three groups: the new approach, traditional nutrition education, or a nonfood-related control group. Then hidden observers spied on them surreptitiously at a later date in an unrelated context. The students had access to unhealthy choices, such as Coke, Sprite, Oreos, Doritos, and Cheetos, as well as healthy options, such as sparkling water, fruit cups, trail mix, and baby carrots. What happened? It worked! Compared to the other groups, those given the healthy eating message framed to teen values independently chose to forgo some of the fattening snacks and drinks in favor of the healthier options.


Change the Action

Fancied as asphalt for the highway to hell, good intentions have a bad reputation. Oscar Wilde wrote, “Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil.”3793 Many who have failed to stick to their New Year’s resolutions can relate.

To help secure our goals, we can call on our built-in cognitive capacity to create habits to automate our actions.3794 This starts with implementation intentions.3795 Instead of vague self-promises to “do our best,” implementation intentions are specific if-then plans to perform a particular behavior in a specific context. They take the form of When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.3796 For example, If I get hungry after dinner, I will eat an apple. If the triggering circumstance is a regular, daily occurrence, implementation intentions can be the beginning of a beautiful habit.3797

Note that to break a bad habit or create a new one, we have to select a new action (eat an apple) rather than just give up an existing behavior (don’t eat potato chips).3798 To activate the habit-forming mechanism, you likely need a new alternative response, rather than a nonresponse.3799 Evidently, you can’t form a habit of not doing something.3800 Then, to lock it in, you have to purposefully repeat it day after day, week after week, and maybe even month after month before it takes on a mind of its own. It may be a lot of work up front, but once it’s ingrained in our brains, then the need for willpower is replaced by an eerie compulsion to just do the right thing.

During the process of habit formation, it gets easier as we go along. This is particularly the case with dietary interventions because our palates change along the way. For example, ever since I stopped regularly drinking coffee,3801 I’ve been having a really strong chai tea in the morning. At first, I was using one of the less harmful, low-calorie sweeteners to cut the bitterness. Preliminary data suggest sweeteners like monk fruit,3802 erythritol,3803 and allulose3804 are relatively benign in small doses, but low-calorie sweeteners tend to have a bad track record when it comes to safety. Given that I’m always trying to expand the percentage of Green Light foods in my diet, I could have tried a more nutritive sweetener like date syrup, but I decided to try to cut down altogether. Every day, I vowed to use less sweetener than the day before. Now, not only do I take my morning tea unsweetened, I prefer it that way. As a “treat” to myself one day, I decided to add a little sweetener, and it just tasted gross. So now I’m in the best of both worlds where taste and health preferences unite.


Implementation Intentions Put to the Test

Given their simplicity, implementation intentions appear to be surprisingly effective.3805 Imagine you’re a dentist who wants your patients to floss their teeth daily. You give them a complimentary pack of dental floss with a handout telling them how important flossing is and encourage them to floss every day. Having read this book, though, you recall the supposed power of implementation intentions. You’re skeptical, so you randomize half your patients to get the same free floss and identical handout except their version contains one additional message:

You are more likely to carry out your intention to perform dental flossing every day if you make a decision about when and where. Most people perform dental flossing in the bathroom immediately after they brush their teeth at night. Others prefer to do it in the morning after breakfast. Write down where and when you intend to floss your teeth every day for the next 4 weeks.

Just such an experiment was carried out, and that one additional tweak, that one additional message, doubled flossing frequency, from eight days of flossing out of the following month to nineteen days.3806 That’s the power of implementation intentions. (Note that all randomized, controlled, crossover trials to date show that flossing before brushing gets rid of significantly more plaque.3807,3808)

Does what works for flossing work with eating? When researchers interviewed maintainers of significant weight loss, action planning to develop healthy habits arose as a consistent theme. The successful losers often decided in advance what they were going to eat, when, and where. Many consciously planned their meals for the day or week, often getting into the habit of eating similar meals for breakfast and lunch every day. They meal-prepped and kept healthy snacks like carrots and fruits in plain sight. Some made double portions of wholesome meals to refrigerate or freeze in case they got busy.3809 Several brought home only healthy foods from the store. (As one put it, “You cannot eat what you don’t buy.”)

Those all sound like good ideas, but just because those successful at weight loss tended to use lots of implementation intentions doesn’t necessarily mean the intentions had anything to do with it. You can only prove cause and effect with interventional trials where you randomize people to an intervention—or not—and put it to the test. So that’s just what researchers did.

Hundreds of middle-aged women were randomized into one of two groups. Both groups were told about the health benefits of fruits and vegetables, and both groups were encouraged to boost their intakes, but one group got additional instructions to form implementation intentions. They were told to think of all the barriers to healthy eating they encounter on a daily basis and come up with three implementation intentions to overcome them. Typical examples included If I have no fruits at work, then I will buy an apple in the canteen at lunch or If I am eating out for lunch, then I order a salad.3810

In the first couple of months, both groups succeeded in eating more fruits and veggies, but by month four, the implementation-intention group pulled ahead. Two years later, the fruit and vegetable consumption in the information-only group had, unsurprisingly, fallen back toward baseline, but the implementation-intention group was still going strong. After just that single meeting with the experimenters years before, they were still eating significantly more fruits and vegetables, presumably because it had become so routine as to become habit.3811 All because of that simple psychological trick.

Other studies have found intention formation to be a useful tool for solidifying healthy eating and exercise interventions,3812 but what about weight loss? Randomized controlled studies show forming new habits or breaking old ones can not only produce significant weight loss but, more importantly, help keep it off.3813 For example, in one twelve-week study, participants randomized to try to turn the “Top Ten Tips” for weight loss into daily habits lost about seven pounds (compared to no significant weight loss in the control group). The tips were just your run-of-the-mill good advice, such as “Make water your first choice,” “Try reaching ten thousand steps each day,” “Pack healthy snacks,” and “Eat more fruits, vegetables, and pulses (beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils) and less fast food and high-fat dairy and meats.”3814 Losing seven pounds is nothing to sneeze at, but the excitement came from what happened after the study ended.

A year later, not only did the participants randomized to try to habituate the weight-loss tips not gain back the weight, they continued to lose another five pounds on average.3815 Participants described that healthy eating and activity just became “pretty much second nature.”3816 They “just worm their way into your brain,” one person remarked. “Now I actually feel quite strange if I haven’t [eaten a salad].” Overall, 65 percent achieved clinically significant, sustained weight loss by automating healthy behaviors into habits.

Avoiding a Snowball’s Chance

In the study that determined it took an average of sixty-six days of repetition to form a habit, the researchers found that sporadically missing a day resulted in a tiny dip in automaticity the next day but had no longer-term consequences.3818 So if you stumble or forget one day, just pick it back up the next. A series of experiments dating back to the 1970s did uncover a curious quirk of human psychology you should be aware of, though, so you don’t fall into the trap.

Imagine enrolling dieters in a study ostensibly to “investigate the effects of prior taste on subsequent taste perception” by having them “taste test” different flavors of ice cream after drinking a milkshake. Half were told the preload milkshake was “very high calorie,” and the other half were told it was “very low calorie”—though, in truth, all shakes were identical. All the subjects were then instructed to taste and rate three bowls of ice cream, eating as much or as little as they wanted and feeling free to finish them all off if they so wished. What do you think happened?

The rational thing to do if you’re trying to watch your weight is to eat less ice cream after you’ve just had a high-calorie milkshake, right? Well, the exact opposite happened. Those told they were drinking the high-calorie shake went on to eat 43 percent more ice cream than those who had drank what they thought was the low-calorie shake.3819 How does that make any sense? Instead of telling themselves they’d overeaten and shouldn’t make it worse, their attitude appeared to be, “It’s too late now, so I might as well enjoy myself.”

As I mentioned here, this irrational reaction to overindulge after overeating because now the “day is lost” has a name in the scientific psychology literature. It’s been coined the “what-the-hell effect.”3820,3821

Though proximal subgoals, like promising yourself no more than one treat a day, can help keep you on track, they can be counterproductive if they cause you to lose sight of the end goal—that is, losing weight. Slipups can feel like you’ve let yourself down and demotivate you into all-or-nothing thinking.3822 Two cookies can lead you to binge-eat the whole bag.

There are a few ways to counter the what-the-hell effect. You can try extending the time period of the subgoal. So instead of committing to no more than one treat a day, if you swore to yourself that you wouldn’t have more than seven treats in a week, having two cookies in one day might no longer feel like such a face-stuffing failure. You can just make it up tomorrow.3823

Another way identified by researchers to fight the what-the-hell effect is to choose acquisitional, rather than inhibitional, goals. People seem to be better able to deal with coming up short on positive goals than negative ones. So framing your subgoals as things you want to accomplish, rather than avoid, can help you escape the fatalistic, black-and-white thinking that can subvert your longer-term goals. For example, if you aim to drink a large glass of water before every meal but miss one time, there isn’t the same defeatist feeling. Well, I messed up and didn’t drink water before lunch, so forget it. I might as well not drink water before dinner either doesn’t tend to race through your mind. When we have positive subgoals, we’re more likely to think positively—Thankfully, I remembered at breakfast and now dinner, so at least I’m making progress—whereas violating a negative, don’t-do-something goal, like vowing not to touch soda, appears more likely to make what-the-hell break loose.3824

Finally, you can recognize the feeling when what-the-hell arises, realize how ridiculous it is, and try to laugh it off. I had to chuckle at myself the other day when my writing was interrupted by an urgent media call that forced me to delve into a few hours of research unrelated to this book. Afterward, I remember thinking, Well, my day’s shot, so I might as well just stop now and watch a movie or something and start fresh tomorrow. I had just what-the-hell’d myself! I missed a few hours of writing time, so therefore I should miss more time? Realizing how silly that was, I got back to work.

Avoiding the Self-Licensing Trap

The flip side of subgoal setbacks blowing your end goal is when subgoal successes do the same thing. Remember self-licensing, the other irrational phenomenon where dietary supplements led smokers to light up more and dieters to eat more junk? It’s when movement toward our goals can justify indulgences that set us further back. Excuses like I worked hard this week so I deserve it fall into this category.3825 There’s a reason it’s the catchphrase for marketers the world over. (Who can forget, You deserve a break today at McDonald’s?)

Would you guess that smokers of “light” cigarettes would be more or less likely to quit compared to those who smoke regular cigarettes? You might reason that those choosing to find lower-tar varieties are already acknowledging and trying to cut down on the risks, so they would probably be more ripe to quit, right? But no. They are more than 50 percent less likely to kick the habit. This failure is presumed to be a licensing effect, where their imagined progress toward their goal of not dying from lung cancer is subconscious justification to indulge their addictions that may end up killing them. (The cruel irony of light cigarettes is that smokers tend to use more of them or instinctively hold the smoke in longer such that the same amount of tar ends up being deposited in their lungs.3826)

Check out how this manifests in the world of weight loss. The best predictor of future performance is past performance, right? Haven’t we all heard past-as-prelude aphorisms? Well, if you follow dieters over time, it turns out the opposite can be true. Weight loss in one week appears to have a strong negative impact on weight loss in the subsequent week.3827 Naïvely, you might think that progress begets progress, with good news on the bathroom scale inspiring further motivation to stick with it. But instead of taking a victory lap (burning even more calories!), people tend to use the occasion of their progress as a pretext to indulge. After all, they figure, they deserve it.

This counterintuitive consequence draws from a larger literature on “moral licensing.” Researchers have found a prior good deed can lead people to act questionably later on. Virtue can lead to veritable villainy. You’d think people would take pride in the integrity of moral consistency, but instead, being good appears to liberate us to be bad.3828

Consider this disturbing study out of the University of Toronto: People were randomly assigned to purchase items from one of two online shopping sites, identical except the products were described as environmentally friendly on one of the sites. Then, in a supposedly unrelated task, they played a computer game and were told to pay themselves out of a provided envelope of money for each correct answer. They were told no one was watching and it was all on the honor system. Who do you think acted more honorably? In actuality, the experimenters really were watching them, tallying up the actual number of correct answers, how many the subjects claimed they had gotten correct, and how much money they subsequently took. Shockingly, those randomized to purchase the green products were significantly more likely to then lie, cheat, and steal.3829 Ethical acts may license unethical behaviors, and it may only take a molehill of virtue to create a mountain of immorality.3830

Self-licensing can also involve self-delusion. The effect is so powerful that when people are presented with a temptation, they tend to exaggerate in their minds how well they’ve been eating in order to justify the indulgence. So not only may progress toward a goal rationalize lapses, but even misremembered distortions of progress can cause us to slide.3831 This is why it’s so important to be aware of the psychological tricks our minds can play on us so we can counter them.

Even visions of future progress can trigger licensing and undercut our goals. How many times have you been tempted to slip “just this once,” resolving to make up for it tomorrow? But “tomorrow” may never come. If you offer people watching their weight the choice of a “large Mrs. Field’s cookie” or a snack they perceive as healthy (plain fat-free yogurt) around 50–60 percent choose the cookie. If, however, as you offer them the choice, you tell them they’ll be given the same choice the following week, the number choosing the cookie jumps up to 70 or 80 percent. Do you see what happened? People told themselves they’ll choose the healthier option the next week, thereby justifying their choice to jump at the cookie this week.

What happens if you tell people they can choose between the cookie or the yogurt this week, but only the healthier option will be offered the following week? Those choosing the cookie shoots up to 90 percent! Sadly, our brains don’t work the other way around. Telling people they’re just going to get the cookie next time doesn’t increase their odds of making healthier choices in the present.3832 Our minds are always reaching for the rationalization.

Ironically, those with the greatest self-control are the most vulnerable to this kind of behavior.3833 They’re so sure they’re going to be able to resist the temptation—next time—they feel licensed to indulge now. To neutralize this effect, try to make each decision on its own merits in the here and now. In that present moment, regardless of what you did before or plan on doing later, consider the best choice to fulfill your long-term goals.

Does that mean you should never splurge, never veer off the path? Self-licensing is dysfunctional if it’s your mind tricking you into stumbling too easily or too often, but it can be useful if it supports long-term dietary adherence. If cheating every once in a while helps you sustain a healthier lifestyle, then it could be beneficial in the long run.3834 The difference is in the design. Cheating isn’t cheating if it’s baked into the plan. Those who prearrange to give themselves a certain number of passes every month to skip the gym or eat whatever they want can do so without deceiving themselves or inviting the wrath of the what-the-hell effect. Because it’s all just part of the plan.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

The business world knows all about how to make things easy. It’s the reason Amazon has a 1-Click Buy button.3835 This is why the term habit-forming can be a good thing when you consciously turn it to your advantage. It can turn healthy decisions into an impulse buy.

Using implementation intentions, we can begin the process of automating healthy urges away from conscious control. Then we can relax and let the habitual subroutines do all the work. There’s no need for willpower when you have chill power.

Those who’ve seen my “blender burpees” cooking video know a bit about how I style implementation intentions in my own life. A typical if-X-then-Y for me is As I fill up my water bottle, I’m going to try to fit in ten squats. Better that than just standing there getting nothing else done as I get my water, right? That’s actually where my Daily Dozen checklist sprang from, a set of acquisitional goals to remind me to fit in more of the healthiest of healthy foods.

For example, burdened with the knowledge that dark green leafy vegetables are the healthiest foods on the planet, I’m always trying to intentionally implement ways to fit more into my diet. Every time I shop for groceries, for instance, I make myself buy at least two bunches of greens for every day of the week. (But if I run out, I know I always have an emergency stash of bags of frozen greens in my freezer.) I also changed a snacking habit to If I get hungry, I’ll snack on roasted nori. For me, it was less about the calories (though nori does only have about five to ten calories a sheet), and more about the marvel of enjoying dark green leafy vegetables as a snack. I even sip on matcha tea, so I can drink my dark green leafies too.

To maintain healthy habits, I described the pitfalls—the two psychological glitches that can threaten your goals from both directions. Say you’re trying to get into the habit of drinking water instead of soda. On the one hand, if you slip, your morning Mountain Dew can turn into a what-the-hell chugfest. If, on the other hand, you succeed, the licensed self-indulgence side could rationalize one or two “live a little” liters. I know it can be seductive to rationalize. Sometimes when I’m on the road for a weeks-long stretch, jet-lagged after some hectic four-hour book-signing, the junky snacks in the late-night hotel minibar start looking pretty enticing. I’ve found for me it helps to turn those feelings of entitlement around. No, I tell myself. You know what you really deserve? To be healthy.

When we get dehydrated, our blood volume actually shrinks. This drop is detected by our kidneys, which then release an enzyme into our bloodstreams that triggers the cascade that results in the formation of a hormone called angiotensin, which, in turn, causes us to become thirsty and constricts our blood vessels to raise our blood pressures to compensate for the diminished blood volume. (This is how a popular class of blood pressure–lowering medications works. The ACE in ACE inhibitors—like captopril—stands for angiotensin-converting enzyme.)

That isn’t all that angiotensin does, though. Drip the hormone onto human fat cells in a petri dish, and they start piling on more fat.3868 This may help explain why those with higher angiotensin levels in their bloodstreams tend to be heavier.3869 The thought is that those who don’t drink enough end up with chronically elevated angiotensin levels, which can lead to weight gain.3870 The most convincing evidence comes from genetic studies showing that those born predisposed to higher angiotensin levels are significantly more likely to become obese.3871 We can keep our levels down in the normal range, though, by staying adequately hydrated.

Purify your water

Nearly 40 percent of Americans use some sort of water purification device.3885 Two of the most common approaches—pour-through pitchers and refrigerator filters—were tested head-to-head against Tucson tap water. Both of the fridge filters (GE and Whirlpool) did similarly well, removing more than 96 percent of trace organic contaminants, edging out the three pitcher filters, which ended up catching 93 percent (ZeroWater), 84 percent (PUR), and only 50 percent (Brita).3886 A similar discrepancy was found between PUR and Brita brand filters tested specifically against disinfection by-products.3887 Reverse osmosis systems can work even better, but their cost, water waste, and loss of trace minerals3888 make them seem unworthwhile.

The annual cost for purifying your water with a pour-through pitcher or fridge filter was calculated to be about the same, at only around a penny per cup (with the exception of the ZeroWater brand, which is up to four times more expensive).3889 I figured the “change by” dates on the filters were just company scams to get you to buy more, but I was wrong. Since I drink filtered water mostly just for taste, I used to wait until the water started tasting funky before I changed the filter. Bad idea. Not only do the filters eventually lose much of their removal capacity, but bacterial growth can build up inside them, resulting in your filtered water having higher bacterial counts than the water straight out of the tap.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

You can check your hydration situation by monitoring the color of your urine. Originally validated as a way to detect acute dehydration in athletes,3891 it’s now used more broadly in studies of the general population to track hydration status3892 (including pregnant and lactating women).3893 The gold standard (or rather, the pale gold standard) is the color of straw. For those of you who didn’t grow up playing on bales in barns like I did, that means a light yellow. Note that if you take B vitamins or eat riboflavin-rich foods, that can throw off the results.3894 Riboflavin (also known as vitamin B2) gets its name from the Latin word flavus, for yellow.3895 So if you dust your air-popped popcorn with nutritional yeast, a vitamin-packed cheesy topping (spritzing the popcorn first with apple cider vinegar to get it to stick, of course), your urine stream can light up neon yellow like a light saber. This can give the false impression that your urine is more concentrated than it is and, hence, that you’re more dehydrated than you actually are.

Is there any danger in drinking too much water? Absolutely, yes. Even healthy kidneys can only handle about three cups of water an hour.3896 Beyond that, we risk washing the electrolytes out of our brains with potentially lethal consequences. Can you just replenish with a sports drink? No. In fact, there is a high-profile case of a high school athlete who died after drinking two gallons of Gatorade.3897 Drinking too much of anything can be dangerous.

In 2018, researchers at the University of Nebraska published a paper pitting whole grains against fruits and vegetables head-to-head for their anti-inflammatory properties. Which won? Both! Both groups experienced anti-inflammatory benefits, but in distinct ways, affecting different markers of inflammation. This implies that whole grains, fruits, and vegetables lower inflammation through different mechanisms, suggesting consuming them all together could have a synergistic effect.3911 So our best bet may be to eat a variety of foods as grown. Have any plants been shown to be particularly potent?


//
Crying Wolf(berry)

Obesity is associated with elevated levels of oxidative stress,3912 which can result in free radical damage to proteins within the body that can trigger inflammation.3913 Might an antioxidant-rich fruit be able to help break this vicious cycle? Goji berries, also known as wolfberries, have at least four times the antioxidant activity compared to other dried fruits like raisins or dried cranberries that you might sprinkle on your oatmeal or add to your trail mix.3914 Beyond its rich antioxidant content, a number of anti-inflammatory compounds have also been specifically identified in the fruit.3915 In the lab, goji berries do have anti-inflammatory effects on cells from umbilical cords, one of the most convenient sources of human tissue, but what about in whole humans outside the lab?3916

Petri dish studies on goji berries have concluded they “could be developed as a new anti-inflammatory therapeutic herbal medicine,”3917 but you don’t know until you put it to the test. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have shown anti-inflammatory effects3918 while otherwise potentially improving immune function (boosting vaccination response among elderly individuals),3919 but does that translate into weight loss?

Goji berry juice doesn’t seem to work for weight loss, or at least the GoChi beverage sold by a multilevel marketing company3920 accused of making such false and misleading claims didn’t.3921 What about just giving people actual berries? (What a concept!) Brazilian researchers split people into two groups.3922 Both were given identical instructions to follow a healthier diet, but one group was also given fourteen grams of dried goji berries a day, which is about two tablespoons.3923 Forty-five days later, the goji group appeared to cut two and a half inches off their waistlines compared to no change in the control group. This presumed drop in abdominal fat was accompanied by significant drops of about 20 percent in both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.3924 Of course, it would have been better if the researchers had given the control group something like raisins (which haven’t shown a slimming effect)3925 to help discount the placebo effect, but what’s the downside of giving gojis a go?

Anti-Inflammatory from My Head To-ma-toes

How about a weight-reducing, anti-inflammatory vegetable? There’s no need to look for an exotic goji equivalent. If you don’t count french fries and other potato products, tomatoes are America’s most popular vegetable3926 and have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in both petri dishes3927 and people.3928 Randomize overweight individuals to a little less than a can of tomato juice a day (330 ml), and see a drop in inflammation within three weeks.3929 Low-sodium V8 juice may also help.3930

Give people about a quarter cup a day of tomato paste, and get an improvement in artery function within fifteen days, an effect attributed to both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.3931 Anti-inflammatory benefits can even be realized at a single meal. Men and women were randomized to a pro-inflammatory meal (containing saturated fat in the form of cream cheese and coconut milk) with or without about a third of a cup of tomato paste. The tomato paste significantly blunted the rise of an inflammatory mediator that occurred within hours of consumption.3932

Tomatoes are so anti-inflammatory that tomato extracts have been investigated as a potential replacement for aspirin as a blood thinner.3933 The effects have been attributed to lycopene, the red pigment3934 in tomatoes, watermelon, and other such hued fruits and vegetables, but we now know that tomatoes contain a large number of diverse anti-inflammatory compounds.3935 That may be why giving people Lyc-O-Mato lycopene supplements alone appears to have no effect.3936 The question is: Can tomatoes help you lose weight?

Perimenopausal women asked to drink nearly a cup of tomato juice twice a day had an improvement in menopausal symptoms, but no weight loss—though they did appear to get about a 150-calorie-per-day boost in their resting metabolic rates.3937 That may help explain why a study of younger normal-weight women drinking about a cup of tomato juice a day experienced a reduction in weight, body fat, and waist circumference. The changes were minuscule, though, with only about a pound of weight and a half inch off the waist, and more importantly, there was no control group.3938 As we know, just being in a study under observation can get people to lose weight. There was a controlled study, however, that did suggest there may be something special about tomatoes.

UK researchers fed people sandwiches made out of white bread, tomato-enriched white bread that was 40 percent tomatoes by weight, or carrot-enriched white bread that was 40 percent carrots by weight. The tomato bread was significantly more filling, but apparently not only because it was replacing some of the white flour, since the 40 percent carrot-enriched bread failed to cause the same dip in hunger.3939 Where can you find tomato bread, though? Can’t you just eat a tomato? Good idea!

Women who were asked to eat a ripe tomato before lunch every day for one month dropped two pounds with improvements in blood sugars, cholesterol, and triglycerides.3940 Again, this study had no control group, but you can imagine how such a result could be possible. A tomato is 95 percent water, so you’d effectively be filling up a fist-sized portion of your stomach with only about fifteen calories right before a meal.3941 This reminds me of the pears-and-apples study that found a similar effect interspersing meals with fruit.

Turmeric and Nutritional Yeast—Good as Gold?

If you recall, the spice turmeric is scored as the most anti-inflammatory food in the Dietary Inflammatory Index.3943 In vitro, curcumin—the pigment in turmeric responsible for its bright yellow color—has a stronger and broader anti-inflammatory profile than the powerful anti-inflammatory corticosteroid drug prednisolone.3944 Various turmeric preparations have been shown to offer benefit for inflammatory diseases of the joints,3945 lungs,3946 skin,3947 and gut.3948 This includes turmeric extracts, purified curcumin, and just about a half teaspoon a day of the plain spice you can find at the store.3949 Though curcumin from turmeric doesn’t appear to blunt the acute, pro-inflammatory effects of a milkshake,3950 randomized controlled trials clearly show a drop in a variety of inflammatory markers when it is taken over time.3951,3952

Turmeric is one of the few foods that have actually been put to the test in people. A turmeric-based spice mix was found to suppress hunger after a meal,3953 but what about weight loss?

Turmeric curcumin “blocks obesity” in mice fed a high-fat diet,3954 but the human data are disappointing. Out of eight randomized controlled trials, only three showed any kind of significant weight-loss benefit.3955 A different golden-colored seasoning—nutritional yeast—shows more promise.

A special type of fiber called beta-glucan in brewer’s, baker’s, and nutritional yeasts displays anti-inflammatory effects3956 sufficient to improve wound healing3957 and alleviate symptoms in ragweed sufferers.3958 Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of about two teaspoons of nutritional yeast’s worth of beta-glucans have resulted in about an inch off the waist within six weeks3959 or up to a five-pound weight benefit compared to controls in twelve weeks, along with an improvement in blood pressure.3960 Both of these studies were funded by companies trying to sell supplements, but I figure what are the side effects—tastier popcorn? I would, however, caution against the use of nutritional yeast for those with Crohn’s disease3961 or a skin condition known as hidradenitis suppurativa3962 due to immune reactivity. (Further details can be found on NutritionFacts.org.)



FOOD FOR THOUGHT

The evidence base for weight loss from specific anti-inflammatory foods is pretty weak, but one would only expect benefits from swapping in goji berries for raisins, nailing my Daily Dozen recommendation for at least a quarter teaspoon of turmeric every day, seasoning with nutritional yeast instead of parmesan, for example, or trying my nutritional yeast–based Savory Spice Blend instead of salt (from my How Not to Die Cookbook, recipe online at www.nutritionfacts.org/recipe/savory-spice-blend/). Brewer’s yeast has the same inflammation-modifying beta-glucan fiber as nutritional yeast, but it also has a bitter flavor that I remember all too well from my childhood. My mom used to mix a spoonful into orange juice to make what she used to call Yeast Juice (and yes, it tastes as bad as it sounds).

You can also try eating a tomato salad as an appetizer. What I like to do is quarter a ripe tomato, grind on some freshly cracked pepper, and add a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and some shreds of fresh basil. Delish!

A Slow Burn

Other players in the weight-loss game are all the compensatory survival mechanisms our bodies use to defend against weight loss. Because of our millions of years of evolution hardwiring us to survive scarcity,3985 when we start losing weight, we may unconsciously start moving less as a behavioral adaptation to conserve energy.3986 There are metabolic adaptations as well. Our metabolisms slow down.3987 Every pound of weight loss may reduce our resting metabolic rates by seven calories a day.3988 This may only translate to a difference of a few percentage points for most,3989 but it can rapidly snowball for those who achieve massive weight loss.

During one season, some of The Biggest Loser contestants famously had their metabolic rates tracked. Above and beyond the hundreds of fewer calories it takes just to exist more than one hundred pounds lighter, by the end of filming for that season, their metabolic rates had slowed by an extra five hundred calories a day.3990 The mindblower was that when they were retested six years later, they still had the five-hundred-calorie-a-day handicap.3991 So the contestants had to cut five hundred calories more than anyone else their size to maintain the same weight loss. No wonder the bulk of their weight was regained. Most did remain at least 10 percent lower than their starting weight, and even a 7 percent drop may cut diabetes rates by more than half,3992 but still—the metabolic slowing means they have to work that much harder than everyone else just to stay in place.

Analyzing four seasons of The Biggest Loser minute by minute, researchers noted that 85 percent of the focus was on exercise rather than diet,3993 though the exercise component accounted for less than half of the weight loss.3994 Even six years after their season ended, the contestants had been maintaining the hour of daily, vigorous exercise, yet still regained most of the weight. Why? They started eating more. They could have cut their exercise from sixty to just twenty minutes a day and still maintained 100 percent of their initial weight loss if they would have just kept their intakes under three thousand calories a day.3995 That may not sound like much of a challenge, but weight loss doesn’t just slow our metabolisms—it boosts our appetites.


Appetite for Destruction
If it were merely a matter of our weight settling at the point at which our reduced caloric intakes match our reduced caloric outputs, it would take years for our weight loss to plateau. Instead, the plateau often occurs within six to eight months.3996 You probably know the drill: Start the diet, stick to the diet, and then weight loss stalls six months later. What happened? Don’t blame your metabolism—that only plays a small part. What likely happened is you actually stopped sticking to your diet because your appetite went on a rampage.

If you cut eight hundred calories out of your daily diet and your weight loss stalls after six months, what happened is that despite thinking you’re still down eight hundred calories a day, you may actually only be down six hundred daily calories at the end of the first month. By month two, you’re only down about five hundred calories, down three hundred by month three, and by month six, you’re only eating two hundred fewer calories than before you had started the diet. In other words, you inadvertently suffered an exponential increase in caloric intake over those six months without even realizing it, because, by that time, your body may have ramped up your appetite by six hundred calories. So it still feels as if you are eating eight hundred fewer calories, but you’re actually only down two hundred. By then, your metabolism and physical activity also may have slowed by two hundred calories a day, so with no difference between calories in and calories out, that’s how your weight loss grinds to a complete halt.3997

The slow, upward drift in caloric intake on a new diet is not because you got lazy. Once your appetite is boosted by six hundred calories after you’ve been dieting for a while, eating two hundred fewer calories is as hard as eating eight hundred fewer calories had been at the beginning. So you can maintain the same disciplined level of willpower and self-control, yet still end up stagnating.3998 To prevent this from happening, we need to maintain the calorie deficit. How is that possible in the face of a ravenous appetite?

Hunger is a biological drive. Asking someone to eat smaller portions is like asking them to take fewer breaths. You can white-knuckle it for a bit, but eventually nature wins out. That’s what this book is for. Remember how I discussed in the Eating Rate section that you can cut more than a thousand calories out of people’s daily diets without them even noticing? Sustainable weight loss is not about eating less food—it’s about eating better food.


The Ten-Calorie Rule

If you are able to take advantage of some of the techniques in this book and dutifully maintain a calorie deficit, what weight loss could you expect? If the 3,500-calorie rule is bunk, what’s the alternative? There are validated mathematical models that take into account the dynamic changes that occur when you cut calories, such as the metabolic slowdown. They’ve been turned into free online calculators you can use to make personalized estimates. There’s the Body Weight Planner from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center’s Weight Loss Predictor out of Louisiana State University (LSU).

NIH Body Weight Planner: www.bit.ly/NIHcalculator
LSU Weight Loss Predictor: www.bit.ly/LSUcalculator
The NIH Body Weight Planner has been found to be more accurate, as the LSU model appears to overestimate the drop in physical activity,3999 but they each have their pluses and minuses. The Body Weight Planner tells you how many calories you need to restrict and/or how much more exercise you need to do to achieve a specific weight-loss goal by a specific date. Clicking on the Switch to Expert Mode button gives you a graph and exportable chart showing your day-by-day weight-loss trajectory. The LSU Weight Loss Predictor, on the other hand, doesn’t allow you to adjust physical activity, but its advantage is that you don’t have to choose a goal or time frame. Just put in different calorie changes, and it graphs out your expected course.

Is there any easy rule of thumb you can use? Yes—the Ten-Calorie Rule. Every permanent, ten-calorie drop in daily intake will eventually lead to about one pound of weight loss.4000 It takes about a year to achieve half the total weight change and about three years to completely settle into the new weight. So cutting five hundred calories a day can cause the fifty-pound weight loss predicted by the 3,500-calorie rule, but that’s the total weight loss at which you plateau, not an annual drop, and it takes about three years to get there. A five-hundred-calorie deficit would be expected to cause about a twenty-five-pound weight loss the first year and then an additional twenty-five pounds over years two and three, but that’s only if you can maintain the five-hundred-calorie deficit.

If you’re eating the same diet that led to the original weight problem but just in smaller servings, you should expect your appetite to rev up about forty-five calories for each pound you lose.4001 So if you were cutting five hundred calories a day through portion control alone, before you were down even a dozen pounds, you’d feel so famished that you’d be driven to eat more than five hundred calories a day and your weight loss could vanish. That’s why if you’re dead set on eating the same diet with the same foods only in smaller quantities, you have to cut down more than forty-five calories per pound of desired weight loss to offset your hunger drive.

So to get that one pound off, instead of eating just ten fewer calories a day using the Ten-Calorie Rule, you’d have to eat ten fewer calories on top of the forty-five fewer calories to account for the revving of your appetite, so that’s a total of fifty-five fewer daily calories. Indeed, just changing diet quantity and not quality requires you to take in fifty-five fewer calories per day to lose a single pound. That five-hundred-calorie daily deficit would only net you about a nine-pound weight loss (500 ÷ 55) three years later instead of fifty pounds.4002 That’s why portion-control methods can be such a frustrating failure for so many people.

Exercise Exercise Exercise

The same may be true of bone loss. Lose weight through caloric restriction alone, and you experience a decline in bone mineral density in fracture-risk sites like the hip and spine. However, in the same study, those randomized to lose weight with exercise didn’t suffer any bone loss. The researchers concluded: “Our results suggest that regular EX [exercise] should be included as part of a comprehensive weight loss program to offset the adverse effects of CR [caloric restriction] on bone.”4039

You can never argue with calls for increased physical activity, but even without an exercise regimen, the “very small” drop in bone mineral density in the CALERIE study might only increase ten-year risk of osteoporotic fracture by about 0.2 percent.4040 The benefits of caloric restriction revealed by the CALERIE trial—improved blood pressure, cholesterol, mood, libido, and sleep—would seem to far outweigh any potential risks. The fact that a reduction in calories seemed to have such wide-ranging positive effects led commentators in the American Medical Association’s internal medicine journal to write: “The findings of this well-designed study suggest that intake of excess calories is not only a burden to our physical homeostasis but also on our psychological well-being.”

Fasting

The reason diets don’t work almost by definition is that people go on them, and then they go off them. Permanent weight loss is only achieved through permanent lifestyle change. So what’s the point of fasting if you’re just going to go back to your regular diet and gain all the weight right back?

Fasting proponents cite the psychological benefit of realigning people’s perceptions and motivation.4049 Some individuals have resigned themselves to the belief that weight loss is somehow impossible for them. They may think they’re made differently in some way, and the pounds just won’t come off no matter what they do.4050 The rapid, unequivocal weight loss during fasting demonstrates to them that, with a large enough change in eating habits, it’s not just possible but also inevitable. This morale boost from reasserting control may then embolden them to make better food choices once they resume eating.


Is Fasting Effective?

Is Fasting Effective?
How do fasted patients do long term? (As we’ve said, in obesity research, long term typically means only one or two years, which itself says much about the field.) Some research groups reported “extremely disappointing” results. At around the one-year follow-up after an average weight loss of twenty-seven pounds in twenty-five days of “inpatient starvation,” one study of twenty-three subjects found they had gained back an average of twenty-nine pounds.4063 In another study with follow-ups ranging up to fifty months, only four out of twenty-five “superobese” patients achieved even partial sustained success.4064 Based on these kinds of data, some investigators concluded that “complete starvation is of no value in the long-term treatment of obese patients.”4065

Other research teams have reported better outcomes. One series of more than one hundred individuals found that 60 percent either retained at least some weight loss at follow-up (43 percent) or even continued losing weight (17 percent).4066 The follow-up periods varied from one to thirty-two months with no breakdown as to who lasted how long, though, making the data hard to interpret.4067 In another study, one year after fasting sixty-two patients down sixteen pounds in ten days, 40 percent retained at least seven pounds of that weight loss.4068

Putting six such studies together, hundreds of obese subjects who fasted for an average of forty-nine days lost an average of fifty-two pounds, and around one or two years later, 40 percent had retained at least some of the weight loss.4069 So although most gained back all their weight, 40 percent keeping off at least some weight is extraordinary for a weight-loss study. By comparison, researchers followed one hundred obese individuals on a standard low-calorie diet while getting treatment at a weight-loss clinic and found only one out of one hundred had lost more than forty pounds, and only about one in ten had lost even twenty pounds, with the overall successful weight maintenance at only 2 percent over two years.4070 That’s why having a control group is so important. What may look like a general failure in the fasting trials may actually be a relative success compared to more traditional weight-loss techniques.

Researchers new to the field may find the results reported in a seventy-five-subject “long-term follow-up of therapeutic starvation” to be “clearly disappointing.”4071 One year later, two-thirds were “failures” with more than one-third regaining all the weight they had initially lost. But 12 percent were labeled successes, maintaining sixty pounds of weight loss two years later.4072 In a direct comparison of different weight-loss approaches at another clinic, five years after initiating a conventional low-calorie approach, only about one in five was down twenty pounds compared to nearly half in the group who instead had undergone a few weeks of a fasting program years previously. By year seven, most of those instructed on daily caloric restriction were back to, or had exceeded, their original weight, but that was true of only about one in ten of the fasted group.4073 In an influential paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine on seven myths about obesity, fallacy number three was that “large, rapid weight loss is associated with poorer long-term weight-loss outcomes, as compared with slow, gradual weight loss.”4074 In reality, the opposite is true. The hare may end up skinnier than the tortoise.

Researchers set up a study comparing the sustainability of weight loss at three different speeds: six days of fasting, three weeks of a very-low-calorie diet of six hundred daily calories, or six weeks of a low-calorie diet of twelve hundred daily calories. A year later, the fasting group was the only one who had sustained a significant loss of weight.4075 That was just after one year, though. How about nine years later? “Therapeutic Fasting in Morbid Obesity” is the largest, longest follow-up study I could find.4076 At least some of the fast-induced weight losses sustained a year later were maintained by the “great majority” (90 percent) of the 121 patients. Nine years later, however, that number dropped to fewer than one in ten. Almost everyone had regained the weight they had fasted away. Many patients reported they thought the temporary loss was worth it, though. As a group, they had lost an average of about sixty pounds. They described improved health and quality of life, claiming reemployment was facilitated and earnings increased during that period of time, but the fasting didn’t appear to result in any permanent change in eating habits for the vast majority. The small minority for whom fasting led to sustainable weight loss “all admit to a radical change in previous eating habits.”4077

Fasting only works long term if it can act as a jump-start to a more healthful diet.

In a retrospective, long-term comparison of weight reduction after an inpatient stay at a naturopathic center, those who were fasted lost more weight at the time but were back to the same weight around seven years later. No surprise, since most returned to the same diet they had eaten before. Those who were placed instead on a more healthful, whole-food, plant-based diet were more likely to make persistent changes in their eating patterns and, seven years later, were on average lighter than when they had started.4078

Can’t we have it both ways? Why not use fasting to kick-start a big drop in weight and then start a healthy diet? The problem is that initial big drop is largely illusory.

Fasting for a week or two can cause more weight loss than caloric restriction, but, paradoxically, it may actually lead to less loss of body fat. Eating more calories can lead to more fat loss? Yes. During fasting, the body starts cannibalizing itself and burning more of our protein for fuel.4079 Emperor penguins, elephant seals, and hibernating bears can survive just burning fat without dipping into their muscles, but our voracious, big brains appear to need at least a trickle of blood sugar, and if we’re not eating any carbohydrates, our bodies are forced to start turning our protein into sugar to burn.4080 Even just a few grams of carbs, like those consumed by people who add honey to their water when they fast, for example, can cut protein loss up to 50 percent.4081 What about adding exercise to prevent loss of lean tissues during a fast? That may make it even worse!4082 At rest, most of our heart and muscle energy needs can be met with fat, but if we start exercising, some of the blood sugar meant for our brains is used and our bodies may have to break down even more protein.4083

Less than half the weight lost during the first few weeks of fasting comes from our fat stores.4084 So even if we double our daily weight loss on a fast, we may actually be losing less fat. An NIH-funded study placed obese individuals on an eight-hundred-calorie-a-day diet for two weeks, and they steadily lost about a pound of body fat a day. They then switched to about two weeks of zero calories and started losing more protein and water, but, on average, only lost a few ounces of fat a day. When the subjects were subsequently switched back to the initial eight-hundred-calorie-a-day diet for a week, they rapidly replaced the protein and water they had lost, so the scale registered that their weight went up, but their body fat loss accelerated back to the approximate pound lost a day.4085 The scale made it look as though they were doing better when they were completely fasting, but the reality is they were doing worse. During the five-week experiment, they would have lost more body fat sticking to their calorie-restricted diet than completely stopping eating in the middle of the trial.

Is Fasting Safe?

Eventually, after the third week of fasting, fat loss starts to overtake the loss of lean body mass in obese individuals, but is it safe to go that long without food? Proponents speak of fasting as a cleansing process, but some of what they are purging from their bodies are essential vitamins and minerals.4086 Heavy-enough people can go up to 382 days without calories, but no one can go even a fraction that long without vitamins. Scurvy, for example, is diagnosable within as few as four weeks without any vitamin C.4087 Beriberi is the disease caused by thiamine deficiency, the inadequate intake of vitamin B1. It may start even earlier than scurvy in fasting patients4088 and, once manifest, can result in brain damage within days,4089 which can eventually become irreversible.4090 Even though fasting subjects report problems such as nausea and indigestion taking supplements,4091 all the months-long fasting cases I’ve mentioned were given daily multivitamins and mineral supplementation as necessary. Without supplementation, hunger strikers and those undergoing prolonged fasts for therapeutic or religious purposes, like the Baptist pastor hoping to “enhance his spiritual powers for exorcism,” have ended up paralyzed,4092 comatose,4093 or worse.4094

Nutrient deficiencies aren’t the only risk of extended fasting. Reading about all the successful reports of massive weight loss from prolonged fasting in the medical literature, one doctor decided to give it a try. Of the first dozen patients he put on fasts, two died. His report, “Death During Therapeutic Starvation for Obesity,” certainly put a damper on the enthusiasm for fasting.4095 In retrospect, the two patients who died started out with heart failure and had been on diuretics. Fasting itself produces a pronounced diuresis, a loss of water and electrolytes through the urine, so it was the combination of fasting on top of the “water pills” that likely depleted their potassium and triggered their fatal heart rhythms.4096 The doctor went out of his way to point out that “both the deaths in this series were admitted in severe heart-failure … but both had improved greatly whilst undergoing starvation therapy.”4097 Small consolation since they were both dead within a matter of weeks.

It would be one thing if all therapeutic fasting fatalities had come from complications of concurrent diuretic use, but that is not the case. “At first he did very well and experienced the usual euphoria,” described one doctor about a fasting patient. His electrolytes remained fine, but, in the middle of the third week, he suddenly collapsed and died. “This line of treatment is certainly tempting because it does produce weight-loss and the patient feels so much better,” the doctor concluded, “but the report of case-fatalities must make it a very suspect line of management.”4098

Contrary to the popular notion that the heart muscle is specially spared during fasting, the heart appears to experience similar muscle wasting.4099 This was noted in the victims of the Warsaw ghetto during World War II in a remarkable series of detailed studies carried out by the ghetto physicians before they themselves succumbed.4100 In a case entitled “Gross Fragmentation of Cardiac Myofibrils After Therapeutic Starvation for Obesity,” a twenty-year-old woman achieved her ideal body weight after losing 128 pounds fasting for thirty weeks. After a breakfast of one egg, she had a heart attack and died. On autopsy, the muscle fibers in her heart showed evidence of widespread disintegration. The pathologists suggested that “this regimen should no longer be recommended as a safe means of weight reduction.”4101

Breaking the fast appears to be the most dangerous part.4102 After World War II, as many as one out of five starved Japanese prisoners of war tragically died following liberation.4103 Now known as refeeding syndrome, multi-organ system failure can result from resuming a regular diet too quickly.4104 Some critical nutrients, such as thiamine and phosphorus, are used to metabolize food. In the critical refeeding window, if too much food is taken before these nutrients can be repleted, demand may exceed supply and whatever residual stores are still left can be driven down even further, with potentially fatal consequences.4105 That’s why rescue workers are taught to always give thiamine before food to victims who had been trapped or otherwise unable to eat.4106 Thiamine is responsible for the yellow color of “banana bags,” a term you might have heard used on medical dramas, used to describe an IV fluid concoction often given to malnourished alcoholics to prevent a similar reaction.4107 Anyone with negligible food intake for more than five days may be at risk of developing refeeding problems.


Therapeutic fasting for obesity has been largely abandoned by the medical community not only because of its uncertain safety profile but also because of its questionable short- and long-term efficacy.4115 Remember, for a fast that only lasts a week or two, you might be able to lose as much body fat, or even more, on a low-calorie diet than a no-calorie diet. Abstinence may be easier to practice than temperance, though. Paradoxically, studies suggest people experience less hunger on a total fast compared to a low-calorie diet.4116 This may be thanks to ketones.

High-fat diets in general are purported to increase breast cancer risk through “oxidative stress, hormonal dysregulation, or inflammatory signaling.”4144 A strong association has also been found between saturated fat intake and prostate cancer progression. Those in the top third of saturated fat consumption appeared to triple their risk of dying from prostate cancer.4145 A meta-analysis of studies on diet and breast cancer mortality concluded that “saturated fat intake negatively impacts upon breast cancer survival,” finding a 50 percent increase in the hazard of breast cancer–specific death for those with the most saturated fat intake compared to those women with the least.4146 There’s a reason the official American Cancer Society / American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guidelines recommend a dietary pattern for breast cancer patients that’s essentially the opposite of a ketogenic diet: “high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes; low in saturated fats.”

Ketogenic Diet Put to the Test

By eschewing carbohydrates, you force your body to burn fat. And indeed, the amount of fat you burn shoots up when you eat a ketogenic diet.4150 At the same time, however, the fat you take in shoots up when you eat a ketogenic diet. The question is what happens to our overall body-fat balance? 4151 You can’t empty a tub by widening the drain if you’re also cranking open the faucet. Low-carb advocates had a theory, though—the so-called carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity.

Proponents of low-carbohydrate diets, whether a ketogenic diet or some more relaxed form of carbohydrate restriction, suggested that the decreased insulin secretion would lead to less fat storage. So even if you were eating more fat, less of it would stick to your frame. You’d be burning more and storing less—the perfect combination for fat loss—or so the theory went.4152 To their credit, instead of just speculating about it, they decided to put it to the test.

In 2012, Gary Taubes co-formed the Nutrition Science Initiative reportedly to sponsor research to validate the carbohydrate-insulin model.4153 He’s the journalist who wrote the controversial 2002 New York Times Magazine piece “What If It’s All Been a Big Fat Lie?” which attempted to turn nutrition dogma on its head by arguing in favor of the Atkins diet and its bunless bacon cheeseburgers based on the carbohydrate-insulin model.4154 (Much of Nina Teicholz’s more recent The Big Fat Surprise is simply recycled from Taubes’s earlier work.4155) Some of the very researchers Taubes cited to support his thesis accused him of twisting their words.4156 “The article was incredibly misleading,” one said. “I was horrified.” “He took this weird little idea and blew it up, and people believed him,” said another. “What a disaster.”4157 It doesn’t matter what people say, though. All that matters is the science.

Taubes attracted $40 million in committed funding for his Nutrition Science Initiative in part to prove to the world that more body fat could be lost on a ketogenic diet and contracted noted NIH researcher Kevin Hall to perform the study. Seventeen overweight men were effectively locked in what’s called a metabolic ward for two months to allow researchers total control over their diets. For the first month, they were placed on a typical carbohydrate-rich diet (50 percent carbohydrate, 35 percent fat, and 15 percent protein) and then switched to a low-carb ketogenic diet (5 percent carbohydrate, 80 percent fat, and 15 percent protein) for the second month. Both diets had the same number of daily calories. If a calorie is a calorie when it comes to weight loss, then there should be no difference in body fat loss on the regular diet versus the ketogenic diet. But, if Taubes were right, if fat calories were somehow less fattening, then body fat loss would become accelerated on the keto diet. What happened instead, in the very study funded by his Nutrition Science Initiative, was that body fat loss slowed upon switching to the ketogenic diet.4158

Just looking at the readings on their scales, the ketogenic diet would seem like a smashing success. The subjects went from losing less than a pound a week on the regular diet to losing three and a half pounds within seven days after switching to the ketogenic diet. What was happening inside their bodies, however, told a totally different story. On the keto diet, their rates of body fat loss were slowed by more than half, so most of what they were losing was water. The reason they started burning less fat on a ketogenic diet is presumably the same reason people who start fasting may start burning less fat: Without carbohydrates, the preferred fuel, their bodies started burning more of their own protein. Switching to a ketogenic diet made them lose less fat mass and more fat-free mass.4159 That may help explain why the leg muscles of CrossFit trainees placed on a ketogenic diet may shrink as much as 8 percent.4160

The study subjects did start burning more fat on the ketogenic diet, but they were also eating so much more fat on that diet that they ended up retaining more fat, despite the lower insulin levels. This is “diametrically opposite”4161 to what the keto crowd had predicted. In science-speak, the carbohydrate-insulin model “failed experimental interrogation.”4162

In a separate experiment, Dr. Hall showed that if you cut about eight hundred calories of carbohydrates a day from your diet for six days, you lose fifty-three daily grams of body fat, but, if you cut eight hundred calories of fat, you lose eighty-nine daily grams of body fat. That’s nine pats of butter worth of extra fat melting off their bodies every day. Same number of calories, but 68 percent more daily fat loss when they cut down on fat instead of carbs. The title of the study speaks for itself: “Calorie for Calorie, Dietary Fat Restriction Results in More Body Fat Loss Than Carbohydrate Restriction in People with Obesity.”4163

Once again, the scale would mislead us into thinking otherwise. After six days on the low-carb diet, study subjects lost four pounds, but they lost less than three pounds on the low-fat diet. Less loss of body fat, but, stepping on the scale, it looks like the low-carb diet wins hands down, so it’s easy to see why low-carb diets are so popular. But yet again, what was happening inside their bodies told the real story. The low-carb group was losing mostly lean mass—water and protein. This loss of water weight helps explain why low-carb diets have been such “cash cows”4164 for publishers over the last 156 years.4165 As one weight-loss expert noted, “Rapid water loss is the $33-billion diet gimmick.”4166

What we care about is body fat, not water weight. Over those six days, the low-fat diet extracted a total of 89 percent more fat from the body than the low-carb diet.4167 A meta-analysis of thirty-two controlled feeding studies swapping fat and carbs found the same thing: Less fat in the mouth means less fat on the hips, even when taking in the same number of calories.4168

In light of the “experimental falsification”4169 of the low-carb theory, the Nutrition Science Initiative effectively collapsed in 2016,4170 but not before Taubes personally pocketed in excess of a half million dollars.


Gut Reaction

Human studies have shown a drop in beneficial Bifidobacteria and a decrease in overall short-chain fatty-acid production, both of which would be expected to increase the risk of gastrointestinal disease.

Striking at the Heart
What might all that saturated fat be doing to the heart? A meta-analysis of four cohort studies following the diets, diseases, and deaths of more than a quarter million people found that those who eat lower-carb diets suffer a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality, meaning they live, on average, significantly shorter lives.4188 The risk of cardiovascular disease specifically appears to depend on the source of fat. In a Harvard study of heart attack survivors, those who adhered more to a lower-carb diet based on animal sources of fat and protein had a 50 percent higher risk of dying from a heart attack or stroke, but no such association was found for lower-carb diets based on plant sources.4189 These studies were based on low-carb scoring systems, though, so they speak more to the risks of lower-carb eating rather than a truly low-carb ketogenic diet.

Cholesterol production in the body is directly correlated to body weight.4190 Every pound of weight loss by any means is associated with about a one-point drop in cholesterol levels in the blood.4191 But when people are put on ketogenic diets, the beneficial effect on bad LDL cholesterol is blunted or even completely neutralized.4192 Counterbalancing changes in LDL size or HDL cholesterol are not considered sufficient to offset this risk.4193 You don’t have to wait until cholesterol builds up in your arteries to have an effect, though. Within three hours of eating a meal high in saturated fat (even from plant sources such as coconut oil), you can see a significant impairment of artery function.4194 Even with about a dozen pounds of weight loss, artery function worsens on a ketogenic diet instead of getting better,4195 which appears to be the case with low-carb diets in general.


The irony doesn’t stop there. One of the reasons diabetics suffer such nerve and artery damage is an inflammatory metabolic toxin known as methylglyoxal, which forms at high blood sugar levels. Methylglyoxal is the most potent creator of advanced glycation end products (AGEs),4207 which are implicated in degenerative diseases from Alzheimer’s disease and cataracts to kidney disease and strokes.4208 One would expect high exposure to preformed AGEs on a ketogenic diet, since they are found concentrated in animal-derived foods that are high in fat and protein, but less internal, new AGE formation due to presumably low levels of methylglyoxal given the low blood sugars.4209 Dartmouth researchers, however, were surprised to find more methylglyoxal. Two to three weeks on the Atkins diet led to a significant increase in methylglyoxal levels, and those in active ketosis did even worse, experiencing a doubling of the glycotoxin levels in the bloodstream.4210 It turns out high sugars may not be the only way to create methylglyoxal.

One of the ketones you make on a ketogenic diet is acetone (known for its starring role in nail polish remover). Acetone does more than just make keto dieters fail Breathalyzer tests4211 and develop what’s described as “rotten apple breath.”4212 Acetone can oxidize in the blood to acetol, which may be a precursor for methylglyoxal.4213 That may be why nondiabetic keto dieters can end up with methylglyoxal levels as high as those with out-of-control diabetes4214 or end up with a heart attack.4215 So the irony of “treating diabetes” with a ketogenic diet extends beyond just the potential of making the underlying disease worse, but by mirroring some of diabetes’ dire consequences.


Bad to the Bone

An official International Society of Sports Nutrition position paper covering ketogenic diets notes “ergolytic” effects—that is, performance-impairing, the opposite of ergogenic—for both high- and low-intensity workouts.4216 For nonathletes, ketosis can increase the feelings of perceived effort and fatigue during physical activity, which could potentially undermine exercise efforts.4217 I already mentioned the shrinkage of measured muscle size among keto-dieting CrossFit trainees.4218 A ketogenic diet may not only blunt the performance of endurance athletes4219 but strength trainers, as well.4220 This is why bodybuilding on a ketogenic diet has been referred to as an “oxymoron” in Exercise and Sports Science Reviews, a journal of the American College of Sports Medicine.4221

What about bone loss? Sadly, bone fractures are one of the side effects that disproportionately plague children placed on ketogenic diets, along with growth stunting and kidney stones.4222 Ketogenic diets may cause a steady rate of bone loss (measured in the spine),4223 presumably because ketosis can put people in a “chronic acidotic state.”4224 Ketones themselves are acidic4225 and can result in a mild metabolic acidosis.4226

As with anything in medicine, it’s all about risks versus benefits. Up to 30 percent of patients with epilepsy don’t respond to anti-seizure drugs, and the alternatives aren’t pretty, including procedures like brain surgery,4227 which can involve implanting electrodes deep through the skull or even removing a lobe of the brain. This can obviously lead to serious side effects,4228 but so can having seizures every day. So if a ketogenic diet helps, the pros can far outweigh the cons. For those just choosing a diet to lose weight, though, the cost-benefit analysis would clearly seem to go the other way.

Different as Night and Day

The best of both worlds was demonstrated in 2018 with time-restricted feeding in a narrower window earlier in the day.4337 Individuals randomized to stick to a six-hour eating window ending before 3:00 p.m. experienced a drop in blood pressure, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance even when all the study subjects were maintained at the same weight. The average drop in blood pressure was extraordinary, from 123/82 down to 112/72 in just five weeks, comparable to the effectiveness of potent blood pressure drugs.

The longest study to date on time-restricted feeding only lasted sixteen weeks, a pilot study with no control group that involved only eight people. Nonetheless, the results are worth noting. Overweight individuals who, like most of us, were eating more than fourteen hours a day, were instructed to stick to a consistent ten- to twelve-hour feeding window of their own choosing. On average, they were able to successfully reduce their daily eating duration by about four and a half hours, and within sixteen weeks, they had lost seven pounds. They also reported sleeping better and feeling more energetic. This may help explain why all the participants voluntarily expressed their interest in continuing the time-restricted feeding on their own after the study ended. You don’t often see that after weight-loss studies. Even more remarkably, eight months later, they had retained their weight loss and improved energy and sleep—all from one of the simplest of interventions.4338

How did it work? As with the other time-restricted feeding trials, even though they weren’t told to change calorie quality or quantity, they appeared to unintentionally eat hundreds of fewer calories a day. With self-selected time frames, you wouldn’t necessarily think to expect circadian benefits, but because they were asked to keep the eating window consistent throughout the week, there may have been. Remember social jet lag, the discrepancy between eating and sleeping patterns on weekdays and weekends? Breakfast may get pushed back an hour or two on free days, as if you had just jumped time zones, so some of the metabolic benefits may have been due to maintaining a regular eating schedule.



Surviving the Test of Time

Early or midday time-restricted feeding may have other benefits as well. Prolonged nightly fasting with reduced evening food intake has been associated with lower levels of inflammation4340 and better blood sugar control, both of which might be expected to lower the risk of diseases such as breast cancer.4341 Data were collected on thousands of breast cancer survivors to see if nightly fasting duration made a difference. Those who didn’t go more than thirteen hours every night without eating had a 36 percent higher hazard of cancer recurrence.4342 These findings have led to the suggestion that efforts to “avoid eating after 8 pm and fast for 13 h[ours] or more overnight may be a beneficial consideration for those patients looking to decrease cancer risk and recurrence,”4343 though we’d need a randomized controlled trial to know for sure.

Early time-restricted feeding may even play a role in the health of perhaps the longest living population in the world, the Seventh-day Adventist Blue Zone in California. Slim, vegetarian, nut-eating, exercising, nonsmoking Adventists live about a decade longer than the general population.4344 Their greater life expectancy has been ascribed to these healthy lifestyle behaviors, but there’s one lesser-known component that may be playing a role. Historically, eating two large meals a day, breakfast and lunch, with a prolonged overnight fast was a part of Adventist teachings. Today, only about one in ten Adventists surveyed was eating just two daily meals, but most (63 percent) reported breakfast or lunch was their largest meal of the day. Though this has yet to be studied with respect to longevity, frontloading one’s calories earlier in the day with a prolonged nightly fast has been associated with significant weight loss over time, leading the researchers to conclude: “Eating breakfast and lunch 5–6 h[ours] apart and making the overnight fast last 18–19 h[ours] may be a useful practical [weight control] strategy.”

****************************************************************************************************
FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Because of the metabolic slowing and increased appetite that accompany weight loss, sustained weight loss requires a persistent calorie deficit of three hundred to five hundred calories a day,4346 which can be accomplished without reducing portion sizes just by lowering the calorie density of meals. Doing so can result in the rare combination of weight loss with an increase in both quality—and even quantity—of food consumed.

Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have an active infection, or are already underweight should not consider a dramatic cut in calories by any means, and anyone on medications or with a chronic medical condition, including diabetes, heart, liver, or kidney disease, or a history of fainting, should do so only under guidance from their health-care providers.

Prolonged water-only fasting is no longer recommended as a clinical treatment option for obesity due to the associated risks of complications.4347 Fasting more than a day or two should be done only under strict medical supervision.

Ketogenic diets are also not recommended. When you think of the ideal attributes of a diet for weight control—safe, effective, protective, healthful, wholesome, sustainable, nutritionally complete, and life-extending—typical keto diets guarantee none of them.

Some forms of intermittent fasting, on the other hand, may be safe and effective (and it’s safe to say cost-effective when it comes to your grocery bills), but apparently no more so for weight loss than continuous caloric restriction.4348 However, combining intermittent-fasting regimens, such as early or midday time-restricted feeding with a healthier diet during the feeding windows, may prove to be particularly powerful. The weight may be worth the wait.

Self-Deception

Obese individuals not only report eating fewer meals but also eating fewer calories. Most studies of reported caloric intake and body weight suggest that the more calories you eat, the slimmer you are. Let that sink in for a moment. Based on interviews and questionnaires asking people how much they eat, as well as monitored eating in restaurants or laboratory settings, there is said to be “overwhelming evidence” that those who are obese eat fewer calories, misleading people to proclaim that the presumption that obesity is caused by overeating is simply a myth.4360 But if you objectively measure how much people are actually eating, the whole charade collapses.4361

For centuries, there have been claims of people thriving on little or no food.4362 A Catholic “mystic,” for example, reportedly not only survived for thirty-five years but even gained weight consuming nothing but a daily communion wafer.4363 This reminds me of the founder of the Breatharian Institute of America. You could attend one of his workshops on how to live on air alone for the low, low price of $100,000—“no refunds”4364—that is, until he evidently got busted sneaking out of a 7-Eleven with a hot dog, Slurpee, and box of Twinkies.4365

When actual caloric intakes are measured, it turns out those who claim they can’t lose weight no matter how little they eat are fooling themselves into thinking they’re eating less than they actually are.4366 A group of “diet resistant” obese individuals were found to be underreporting their actual food intakes by a whopping 47 percent and overreporting their physical activity by about the same amount.4367 So, in reality, the failure to lose weight on a calorie-restricted diet is due to not actually being on a calorie-restricted diet. Were the subjects straight-up lying about their overeating? They didn’t appear to be intentionally deceiving the researchers as much as they apparently were deceiving themselves. When they were informed of the results of the study, they were reportedly surprised and distressed by the findings. Interventional studies have shown for nearly a century that if you lock people in a room, everyone loses weight as predicted.4368

Dietary underreporting by overweight individuals has been called “one of the most robust biopsychological phenomena ever described.”4369 Since snacks appear to be “preferentially forgotten” when obese individuals underreport intake on diet surveys,4370 it isn’t difficult to see how obesity would be correlated with eating less frequently.4371 When you control for the underreporting, the relationship gets flipped on its head, going from heavier individuals appearing to eat less frequently to actually eating more frequently.4372 This would make sense if our bodies aren’t able to fully compensate for snacks by eating that much less at subsequent meals, but you don’t know until you put it to the test.



FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Decreasing the number of times you consume calories a day, whether from dining, snacking, or drinking soda, juice, or the like, may help with weight control, especially if you’re eating junk. If you’re going to eat processed foods, tack them onto meals rather than having them as between-meal snacks.

The healthiest snacks are fresh fruits and vegetables, of course, but I also enjoy snacking on nori sheets, lentil sprouts, “air-fried” purple sweet potato fries, edamame, and seasoned air-popped popcorn.

The worst snacks, according to national snacking guidelines from around the world, are snacks that are sugary, fatty, or salty.4391 One study found body fat benefits to nut-based snack bars. Compared to what, though? You could tell the study was funded by the nut bar company when researchers felt the need to use as a comparator the likes of Oreo Double Stuf cookies.4392

Tempted by unhealthy foods? There are “choice architecture” methods to help cut down on impulsive snacking. For example, placing healthier foods at eye level in the store or at the beginning of a buffet line may nudge people toward better choices. Similarly, when chocolate candies are left on the desks of office workers, more are eaten than if they are placed just out of reach or in an opaque container.4393 In a large field study at Google headquarters, for instance, the separation of the snack station from the beverage station by less than a dozen feet appeared to cut down snacking rates by about 40 percent. The researchers concluded that employers or even families may be able to reduce snack consumption “easily, cheaply, and without backlash” just by adding mild inconvenience. In the Greger household, I am able to instill maximum inconvenience by just not keeping any junk in the house.

Unable to purge your surroundings? The next time cravings hit, try Tetris. A study entitled “Playing ‘Tetris’ Reduces the Strength, Frequency and Vividness of Naturally Occurring Cravings” found that three minutes of distracting oneself with a video game may help tackle cravings4394—though I imagine playing Candy Crush might be counterproductive.

As we’ve discussed, in the current Wild West of lax dietary supplement regulation, a supplement can be marketed without any safety data at all and the manufacturer is under no obligation to disclose adverse effects that may arise.4403 Online vendors assured absolute safety: “No negative side effects … 100% safe for long-term use.”4404 The president of Metabolife International, a leading seller of ephedra, assured the FDA that the company had “never received one notice from a consumer that any serious adverse health event has occurred.” Liar. In reality, Metabolife had received thirteen thousand health complaints, including reports of serious injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths.4405

This is not to say prescription obesity drugs have fared much better. Dozens have been pulled from the market, on average eleven years after the first reports of serious adverse effects.4406 If only there were a way to speed your metabolism without suffering cardiovascular side effects.

Be Still Your Beating Heart
Drinking water stimulates as much of a noradrenaline release as drinking a couple of cups of coffee or smoking a couple of unfiltered cigarettes.4429 If the simple act of drinking water causes such a profound fight-or-flight reaction, why doesn’t it cause your heart to pound and your blood pressure to shoot through the roof? It’s like the diving reflex—when you drink water, your body shoots out noradrenaline while simultaneously sending signals to your heart to slow it down. Try this at home: Measure your heart rate before and after drinking two cups of water. Within ten minutes of drinking the water, your heart rate should slow by about four beats per minute, and by fifteen minutes, you should be down six or seven beats.4430

One of the ways scientists figured this out is by studying heart transplant patients. When a heart is moved from one person to another, all the attached nerves first have to be severed. Amazingly, some of the nerves can grow back, but even so, give healed heart transplant patients two glasses of water and their blood pressures go up as much as twenty-nine points.4431 The body is unable to sufficiently quell the effect of that burst of noradrenaline. Some people have a condition known as autonomic failure, in which blood pressure regulation nerves don’t work properly, and their pressures can skyrocket dangerously more than one hundred points after drinking two cups of water.4432 That’s how powerful an effect the simple act of drinking a glass of water can be, and the only reason that doesn’t happen to all of us is that we have an even more powerful counterresponse to keep our hearts in check. It reminds me of the poor woman who had a stroke after taking the ice bucket challenge due to an insufficient diving reflex to tamp down all that extra noradrenaline.4433

The remarkable water effect can be useful for people suffering from milder forms of autonomic failure, such as orthostatic hypotension, which causes dizziness when people stand up suddenly. Drinking some water before getting out of bed in the morning can be a big help.4434 But what about that metabolic boost? With so much noradrenaline being released, might drinking a few glasses of water cause you to burn more body fat? Could tap water be a safe alternative to ephedra, with all the weight loss but a nice slowing of your heart rate instead? Researchers decided to put it to the test.

Testing the Waters
According to some researchers, “The increase in metabolic rate with water drinking could be systematically applied in the prevention of weight gain.”4445 Talk about a safe, simple, side effect–free solution—in fact, free in every sense. Pharmaceutical companies may spend billions getting a new drug to market.4446 Surely a little could be spared to test something that, at the very least, couldn’t hurt, right? That’s the problem, though. Water is a “cost-free intervention.”4447

As I discussed in the Hydration section, there are observational studies suggesting those who drink four or more cups of water a day, for example, appear to lose more weight independent of confounding factors, such as less soda or more exercise.4448 As always, you can’t really know until you put it to the test.

In 2013, a study entitled “Effect of ‘Water Induced Thermogenesis’ on Body Weight, Body Mass Index and Body Composition of Overweight Subjects” was published.4449 Fifty overweight women aged eighteen through twenty-three were asked to drink, over and above their regular water intakes, two cups of water three times a day a half hour before meals without otherwise changing their diets or physical activity. They lost an average of three pounds in eight weeks. What happened to those in the control group? There was no control group, which is a fatal flaw for any weight-loss study, due to the Hawthorne effect, where just knowing you’re going to be watched and weighed may subtly affect behavior.4450 Of course, we’re just talking about water, so, with no downsides, you might as well give it a try. Nevertheless, I’d feel more confident if there were some randomized controlled trials to really put it to the test. Thankfully, there are.

Overweight and obese men and women randomized to two cups of water before each meal lost nearly five pounds more body fat in twelve weeks than those in the control group.4451 Both groups were put on a calorie-restricted diet, but the group with the added water lost weight 44 percent faster. A similar randomized controlled trial found that about one in four in the water group lost more than 5 percent of their body weight compared to only one in twenty in the control group.4452 This is comparable to some commercial weight-loss programs, and all they did was drink a couple of extra cups of water.4453 The average weight-loss difference was only about three pounds, but those who adhered to the three-times-a-day instructions lost about eight more pounds compared to those who only drank the extra water once a day or less.


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Drink two cups of cold water on an empty stomach a few times a day. Does it matter when? I’ll cover that question in the Negative Calorie Preloading section.

Caution: Never drink more than three cups in an hour, since that starts to exceed the amount of fluid our kidneys can handle.4473 If you have kidney or heart failure, your physician may not want you drinking extra water at all, but even with healthy kidneys, any more than three cups an hour can critically dilute the electrolytes in your brain with potentially critical consequences. (The first patient I ever lost in the hospital was a man who tragically drank himself to death—with water. He suffered from a neurological condition that causes pathological thirst. I knew enough to order his liquids be restricted and shut off his sink, but didn’t think to turn off his toilet.)

Note if you’re on a beta-blocker drug, the entire strategy may fail. If you give people the drug metoprolol (sold as Lopressor) before they chug their two cups of water, the metabolic boost is almost completely prevented.4474 This makes sense since the “beta” being blocked are the beta receptors triggered by noradrenaline. Beta blockers are often prescribed for heart conditions or high blood pressure, and typically end with the letters lol, such as atenolol, nadolol, or propranolol, sold as Tenormin, Corgard, or Inderal, respectively.

The role of exercise

MILD TRENDELENBURG

The Way to a Person’s Stomach Is Through the Heart
In the Hydration section, I detailed what happens when our kidneys detect a drop in blood volume. What happens when our blood capacity expands? Upswings in blood volume are detected by our hearts, which, in response, release a hormone called atrial natriuretic factor, or ANF. We used to think the heart was just a pump, but we now know it’s a gland too. There are stretch receptors in the first chamber of the heart that can detect when excess blood pours in, triggering the release of ANF directly into the bloodstream. What does the hormone do? As the title of a review in an obesity journal puts it: “Heart Hormones Fueling a Fire in Fat.”4475

If you drip ANF on human fat and muscle tissue, fat is released rapidly4476 and muscle cells ramp up their capacity to burn it.4477 Infuse ANF into people, and the rate at which fat is mobilized and burned can bump up by 15 percent.4478 You can take muscle biopsies from people and show how much better their muscles burn fat in the presence of elevated ANF levels.4479 No surprise, then, that obese and overweight individuals tend to have considerably lower levels in their bloodstreams.4480

Why would this stretch-sensitive heart hormone tap into our fat stores? Well, when does the heart get stretched? During intense physical activity. We used to think adrenaline-type hormones were released when we exercise to mobilize fat from our tissues, but we now know ANF from our hearts also plays a key role.4481 If you inject people with the amount of ANF they’d normally get in their systems by exercising, their whole-body-fat burning goes up even if they’re just lounging on the couch.4482

How else can we stretch our hearts that extra little bit to release ANF? By expanding our blood volume through drinking extra water.4483 If you don’t drink any water for twelve hours straight, the ANF levels in your blood may fall by about 25 percent,4484 but if you chug about four glasses of water, your levels can jump 50 percent within ninety minutes.4485 That’s too much to drink at one time,4486 but it can offer a sense of how much potential control we have over this fat-burning hormone.


A New Slant on Weight Loss

How else might we trick our bodies into producing this “exercise hormone” without lacing up our gym shoes? If it’s all about pooling extra blood into our hearts, what about lying down at an angle with your head lower than your feet? It sounds a little funny, but researchers took the possibility seriously enough to run the experiment. They laid people on a slanted surface with their heads down at a six-degree angle, which is enough of a tilt for gravity to pull extra blood up into their torsos. Within an hour, their ANF levels doubled and stayed elevated for the four hours the experiment lasted. Did they suddenly start burning more fat? Yes, the proportion of fat they were burning as fuel shot up by 40 percent—and they were just lying down the whole time.4487

Certainly, if you have a heart condition, such as congestive heart failure, you won’t want to lie tilted back. As many as eight to twelve cups of blood may be displaced into the torso from the extremities,4488 so you have to have the cardiovascular fitness to handle that. Acid reflux could also be a problem. In fact, we typically tell heartburn patients to do the reverse and put a few bricks under the posts at the head of their beds to have gravity work in their favor to keep stomach acid down where it belongs. But for those without medical problems, is there a harm in lying tilted back for a few hours? Well, it could give you a “space headache.”


It Is Rocket Science
In movies, astronauts are shown training underwater, but the gold standard for simulating the physiological effects of the weightlessness of outer space is HDTBR, head-down-tilt bed rest.4489 On Earth, our blood tends to collect in our legs, so our bodies are designed to force blood headward. In outer space, our bodies still try to push our blood “up,” but without Earth’s gravity, blood pushes upward in our heads and chests, just as it does when we lie tilted back. This realization came from cosmonauts returning from the space station feeling as though they were slipping toward the foot of the bed and only feeling “normal” when they were tilted back six degrees.

All the extra blood pooling in the head is thought to contribute to the headaches reported by up to 70 percent of astronauts during spaceflights, and a similar percentage of individuals suffer headaches from prolonged head-down-tilt bed rest. This was after days, though. In preparation for a Mars mission,4490 space agencies put people through head-down-tilt bed rest for prolonged periods, having subjects eating, bathing, and toileting all while lying in bed tilted back for literally months at a time.4491

Extended stretches for weeks may impair brain,4492 lung,4493 and immune function4494 and cause a loss of muscle mass.4495 On the last Apollo mission, the astronauts lost about five pounds of fat over the twelve-day trip, but they also lost about two pounds of lean body mass.4496 Prolonged weightlessness or bed rest, regardless of tilt, can result in muscle and bone loss,4497 but simply sleeping on a slant for a few hours could theoretically offer the boost in fat metabolism without the long-term adverse effects.


Good to the Bone
Sleeping in mild Trendelenburg was actually put to the test to prevent bone loss in sedentary individuals. Restrict people’s activity to under an average of two miles of walking a day, and, within a year, they can lose as much as 15 percent of their bone mineral density. What happened to those randomized to the same exercise restriction but combined with sleeping first at a two-degree head-down tilt, which was increased by two degrees about every two months so they ended up at the end of the year sleeping at a fourteen-degree slant (or at whatever angle they found comfortable)? Not only did it completely block the bone loss, they built more bone. Despite the movement restriction, they ended up with about 12 percent greater bone mineral density than when they had started. Note this bone-building effect was only apparent in sedentary individuals. Another group randomized to the same mild Trendelenburg but also assigned to run an average of five or six miles a day just maintained their same skeletal integrity.4509

The study was repeated, and the same remarkable effects were found. There is something about the “periodic fluid redistribution” that comes with sleeping tilted back at night that actively builds both bone density and volume after the daylong stagnant pooling of blood in the legs in sedentary individuals. The research team claims this is just the beginning to the benefits, citing “unpublished studies” asserting a near panacea of perks to sleeping in Trendelenburg.4510 I can’t be too critical of this apparent dodge when I can’t point to a single study supporting my supposition that it will help with weight loss. As far as I can tell, tilting the scales with a head-down tilt has never been tried or even proposed. What I can promise is that any researchers who take up the gauntlet of putting it to the test will definitely have their study featured in a video on NutritionFacts.org!

NEGATIVE CALORIE PRELOADING

Timing of Water Before Meals
When timed properly, drinking water may be able to affect both sides of the calorie-balance equation. In the Metabolic Boosters section, I explored how drinking two cups of water could increase the calories-out side of the equation. If we time it right before a meal, might we fill ourselves up enough to cut down on the calories-in side too?

Older obese men and women were randomized to drink about two cups of water thirty minutes before a buffet-style meal.4516 Compared to no preload, the water group ate 13 percent less, resulting in seventy-four fewer calories consumed, but this may only work for older individuals. A study of young adults found they ate a similar amount whether or not they preloaded with water thirty minutes before the meal.4517 This discrepancy was presumed to be because stomach emptying slows when we get older. It takes about a third longer for liquids to empty from our stomachs as we age, keeping us fuller for longer.4518 Give some young whippersnappers a few cups of water, and in just ten minutes, half is nearly gone. After thirty minutes, nearly 90 percent of it has already drained out of the stomach.4519 Okay, so what if you don’t wait a half hour?

What if you give young adults two cups of water immediately before a meal? Do they then eat less? Indeed, they eat about 20 percent less, taking in more than one hundred fewer calories.4520 Is this why overweight men and women randomized to two cups of water before each meal lost weight 44 percent faster? 4521 Not entirely. They may have been taking in slightly fewer calories, but not enough to explain the five extra pounds of body fat the water group lost.4522 So the metabolic boost from water intake may be the main effect, but if you’re going to drink two cups of water a few times every day, you might as well do it before meals to take the added advantage of its stomach-filling effect.



****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Aperitif?
Carbonated or not, drinking a beverage that has calories as a preload could defeat the purpose. Even high-protein beverages, such as liquid yogurt or chocolate skim milk, which were presumed to be satiating, didn’t reduce subsequent meal intake any more than did, respectively, a chocolate bar4528 and Coca-Cola.4529 Given that, they would be expected to increase total caloric intake in the end.4530 Alcoholic beverages, however, may be even worse.

Not only does alcohol carry its own calories, it may end up increasing intake. I mean, the whole purported point of an aperitif is to stimulate appetite. When people drink a glass of wine or beer before lunch, they may eat more food than if they had drunk the same volume and calories of grape juice and other nonalcoholic beverages.4531 Those drinking a beer with quadruple the regular alcohol content ate two hundred calories more at a subsequent meal compared to those drinking a regular beer—and that was above and beyond the beer’s own calories.4532 So it’s like a reverse-preload effect that just makes things worse.

At that level of alcohol intake, judgment may be affected as well. Women given about one shot of vodka were covertly observed eating nearly 50 percent more chocolate chip cookies in one study, which was chalked up more to a loss of control than an increase in appetite.4533 Even if alcohol had a neutral effect on consumption, it would still pile on its own calories.4534 That’s one of the benefits of a zero-calorie preload like water.

“Negative Calorie” Salads

A bona fide “negative caloric effect”4551 is easy for water because it doesn’t provide any calories of its own. If drinking water gets us to eat just one fewer calorie or burn just one more calorie, then we’re left with fewer calories to store as fat. And remember: It wasn’t just one fewer calorie, but up to one hundred fewer calories consumed after drinking two cups of water. If preloads can have such a dramatic effect on intake, then what about filling up at the beginning of a meal with low-calorie-density foods?

Celery is the classic example of a food with lots of bulk with few calories, due to its high fiber and water content. There’s even a myth that celery contains fewer calories than the energy required for our bodies to digest it. A cup of celery, about two stalks, has sixteen calories. Digesting that much celery takes about fourteen calories.4552 So, no: The consumption of celery does not induce a negative-energy balance, but you are only left with two calories. If eating a cup of celery before a meal led you to eat even three fewer calories, then celery could end up providing “negative calories” after all.

In a famous series of experiments, researchers at Penn State decided to put water-rich vegetables to the test. Study subjects were served a pasta meal for lunch and told to eat as much or as little as they’d like. On average, they consumed about nine hundred calories. What do you think would happen if as a first course you gave them one hundred calories of salad composed largely of lettuce, carrots, cherry tomatoes, celery, and cucumber? Would they go on to eat the same amount of pasta and end up with a thousand-calorie lunch? Or would they eat one hundred fewer calories of pasta, effectively canceling out the added salad calories? It was even better than that. They ate more than two hundred fewer calories of pasta.4553 One hundred calories in; two hundred calories out. So, in essence, the salad had negative one hundred calories.

Preloading with vegetables can effectively subtract one hundred calories out of our diets. That’s how you can lose weight by eating more food.

Of course, the kind of salad matters. The researchers repeated the experiment, adding a fatty dressing and extra shredded cheese, which quadrupled the salad’s calorie density. Eating this version of the salad as a first course didn’t turn the nine-hundred-calorie meal into one with fewer than eight hundred calories. Instead, it turned it into a meal with calories in the quadruple digits.4554 It’s like preloading pizza with garlic bread. You could end up with more calories overall, whereas a pre-pizza salad may cut calories even more than preloading with water,4555 presumably in part because of the combination of water and fiber in vegetables.

We’ve learned from studies on preloading that eating about a cup of food before a meal decreases subsequent intake by about one hundred calories, so to get a “negative calorie” effect, the preload has to contain fewer than one hundred calories per cup.4556,4557 As you can see in the Calories per Cup chart in the Low in Calorie Density section, that would include most fresh fruits and vegetables. So is that it? Are we simply diluting the calories of a meal by adding low-calorie-density foods, or does the timing matter? To figure that out, you’d have to randomize people to either preload with a salad before a meal or eat that same salad during a meal, and that’s exactly what researchers did.

Those on a diet randomized to eat a preload of a salad comprised mostly of vegetables fifteen minutes before lunch and dinner for three months lost four more pounds than the group given the same extra foods, but with instructions they be eaten alongside their meals and not before.4558 This showed that the “negative-calorie”-preload strategy can indeed lead to weight loss, and the effect appears to extend beyond merely adding more low-calorie-density foods. That actually may be one of the secrets of preloading, though. It’s thought that preloading works by allowing time for our satiety hormones to start ramping up before we dive into the main meal. By frontloading the most healthful foods first, when you’re hungriest, you may also eat more of them.4559 Those given a salad before a meal ate more salad than when it was competing for their attention during the meal.4560 So part of the magic of preloading may indeed lie in eating more low-calorie-density foods after all.



Celery Sun Rash

A warning for those who eat a lot of celery, celery juice, or celeriac (celery root): There are compounds called psoralens in the celery/parsnip/parsley family that can make you sensitive to sunlight.4561 Without skin protection, farmworkers can suffer from a condition known as celery blisters when handling the plants in the sun,4562 and even grocery store workers who go from the produce aisle to the tanning salon can get into trouble.4563 These compounds can make their way into our skin from the inside out as well, and they are not destroyed by cooking. So too much time in the sun after commencing a “celery soup diet”4564 or spending time in a tanning bed an hour after eating just one large celery root may be enough to result in a serious blistering burn.

Soup’s On! Weight’s Off?

The United States is not a nation of soup eaters. Even during the winter months, most Americans don’t eat soup more than a few times a month, whereas in France, for example, about half eat soup at least a few times a week4575 and in Japan, the average is soup every day.4576 In the United States, soup eaters tend to be slimmer on average4577 and significantly less likely to be overweight,4578 but as I discussed in the Low in Calorie Density section, soup eaters also tend to consume healthier diets (with the exception of excess sodium).4579

When put to the test, those randomized to eat more soup lost up to 50 percent more weight,4580 but those weren’t preload studies. It’s like the water and apples—soup anytime is good, but it may work even better right before a meal. If you feed someone a radioactive omelet—that is, one with the egg labeled with an isotope to track it with a gamma-ray camera through the body—those randomized to precede it with about a cup and a half of soup slowed stomach emptying by about 25 percent.4581 This may be why those who have soup as a first course eat so much less throughout the rest of the meal.

Let’s go back to the preeminent preloaded pasta experiments. With no first course, about 900 calories were eaten. When people were given about two cups of vegetable soup totaling around 150 calories before the meal, they ate about 250 fewer calories of pasta.4582 So a healthy soup, like the healthy salad, can end up offering negative 100 calories. A similar study that tracked people’s intake throughout the day found that overweight subjects randomized to prelunch vegetable soup deducted an additional 100 calories at dinner, too, a whole seven hours later.4583 So the next time you sit down to some soup, you can imagine calories being veritably sucked out of your system with every spoonful. Vegetable soup would seem to be the perfect weight-loss food.

Similar results were found for young children. Without any soup, the kids ate about 400 calories of mac ’n cheese. When they first started their meals with about a half cup of tomato soup, though, they ate about 100 fewer calories of mac ’n cheese.4584 Since the soup only contained about 50 calories, it effectively subtracted, rather than added, calories to their diets when used as a first course.

There’s just something special about soup. If you give people about 250 calories of a casserole and a glass of water before eating a buffet meal, they eat about 250 fewer calories at the buffet, effectively just swapping the different foods, calorie for calorie. But take that same casserole and glass of water and blend them into a soup, and once again serve it before the same buffet meal, people went on to eat 350 fewer calories at the buffet. Same calories, same ingredients, same food, but they were just as satiated eating 100 fewer calories when eaten as a soup.4585 Is it simply because soup takes longer to eat? No, the researchers made people eat the actual casserole and the soupified casserole at the same rate. So it’s not that soup is just salty or served hotter or eaten slower. It could be cognitive factors: Soup seems to be perceived as being particularly filling.4586 It may be the sieving effect I talked about in the High in Water-Rich Foods section.4587 We aren’t quite sure, but we do know there’s just something special about soup.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Starting a meal with foods containing fewer than one hundred calories per cup can result in fewer overall calories consumed. This includes many fruits, vegetables, soups, salads, or simply a tall glass of water.

Sleeping in the Sweet Spot

Sleep is a great mystery. A trait shared across animal species, sleep must be of vital importance to survive natural selection pressures to eliminate such a vulnerable state.4595 Indeed, cringeworthy experiments have shown that keeping animals awake long enough can be fatal within eleven to thirty-two days.4596 One function of sleep that has been elucidated in recent years is the clearance of toxic waste substances4597 through a newly discovered drainage system in the brain.4598 This could help explain why those who routinely get fewer than seven hours of sleep a night are at increased risk of developing cognitive disorders such as dementia.4599 Even a single all-nighter can cause a significant increase in accumulation of beta amyloid, a gummy substance implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, in critical brain areas.4600

The lowest risk for developing cognitive impairment was found for those getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night, based on nine studies following twenty-two thousand people for up to twenty-two years.4601 The same range was found for diabetes, based on thirty-six studies following more than a million people, with increasing risk found for those sleeping either six hours a night or less, or nine hours a night or more. Remarkably, the increased risk associated with getting six hours of sleep a night versus seven hours is comparable to the increase in diabetes risk linked to physical inactivity.4602

For death from all causes combined, there have been more than fifty studies following more than three million people for up to thirty-four years. Sleeping too little and for too long are both associated with cutting one’s life short, with the apparent sweet spot at seven hours a night.4603 Seven hours may seem short, but that may actually be what’s natural for our species. Scientists studied three isolated preindustrial societies across two continents and found a surprising uniformity. Despite no electric lighting or electronic gadgets, they stayed up until approximately three hours after sunset and then typically rose before dawn, accumulating about a solid six and a half hours of sleep out of about seven and a half hours in “bed.”4604

A mechanism by which excess sleep might be harmful remains elusive, so the association between increased risk of death and disease with sleeping nine or more hours a night has largely been dismissed as implausible.4605 Could it be reverse causation, like sickness leading to more time in bed instead of vice versa, or confounding factors such as employment status? 4606 After all, who tends to sleep in? Those without a job. There is, however, experimental evidence showing negative health effects from insufficient sleep, including weight gain.


Midnight Munchies

Population studies have found short sleep duration has been associated with obesity in both children4607 and adults.4608 Observational studies can never prove cause and effect, though. Maybe the obesity is leading to sleep loss instead of the other way around. Obesity can cause arthritis, acid reflux, and apnea, all of which can interfere with sleep.4609 The relationship between obesity and sleep apnea, where breathing repeatedly stops and starts throughout the night, may be explained by increased tongue fat—fat deposited inside the base of the tongue. This may contribute to obstructing your airway when sleeping on your back.4610 The reverse causation explanation of the link between obesity and inadequate sleep is bolstered by the findings that weight-loss interventions can improve daytime sleepiness.4611

Potential confounding factors also abound. For example, people with lower socioeconomic status often work less desirable hours, such as rotating or overnight shifts,4612 or may live in noisier neighborhoods with lesser air quality.4613 The link between inadequate sleep and obesity persists after controlling for these factors,4614 but you can’t control for everything. You can’t know for certain if sleep deprivation leads to weight gain until you put it to the test.

If you have people pull an all-nighter, they get hungrier4615 and choose larger portions.4616 If you randomize people to shave off a couple of hours of sleep every night, they can start eating an average of 677 more calories a day compared to the normal-sleep control group.4617 Although individual responses vary widely—anywhere from eating 813 fewer calories per day to as many as 1,437 more calories—on average,4618 sleep deprivation tends to lead people to overeat by about 180–560 calories a day.4619

Restrict people’s sleep, and they also start craving unhealthier choices: more snacks4620 and more sugary and fatty foods.4621 And if you stick people in a brain scanner after staying awake all night4622 or after a few nights of four hours of sleep,4623 their reward pathways light up brighter in response to high-calorie foods. Sleep deprivation bumps up the levels of the chief endocannabinoid in the body, the natural chemical we synthesize that binds to the same receptors as an active ingredient in marijuana.4624 This may help explain the nighttime nibbling.

On the calories-out side of the equation, some short sleepers may take the extra time to exercise, while others will be so sleepy they exercise less.4625 The extra wakefulness may raise calorie expenditures up to about one hundred calories a day,4626 but if sleep-deprived individuals are overeating hundreds of calories, over time, sleep deprivation may end up putting the “wide” in wide awake.


Sleep Less, Gain More

With insufficient sleep inadvertently leading to such higher caloric intake, it’s no surprise that four out of five studies involving as few as two to five nights of sleep restriction found an increase in body weight.4628 Even if you control caloric intake, though, you still lose more fat when you get more sleep.

In an NIH-funded study performed at the University of Chicago Sleep Research Laboratory, overweight subjects who normally got between six and a half to eight and a half hours of sleep a night were randomized to either eight and a half hours of sleep a night or five and a half hours on the same calorie-controlled diet. After two weeks, the groups switched and spent another two weeks on the opposite regimen. They spent a month living in the lab so their diets and sleep could be totally controlled and monitored. By just looking at the scale, sleep duration didn’t seem to matter. During both two-week periods, the subjects ate the same number of calories and lost the same amount of weight, but most of the weight lost when getting eight and a half hours of sleep a night was fat, whereas most of the weight lost when only getting five and a half hours was lean body mass. With the same diet but more sleep, they ended up losing more than twice as much body fat.4629

To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of the genes that were being turned on and off by the sleep deprivation, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup.4630 That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study, the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than five hours a night.4631 What about a more realistic scenario?

Overweight adults were randomized to eight weeks of either a calorie-restricted diet or the same diet combined with five days a week of one less hour of sleep a night. The sleep-restricted group slept one less hour each night on weekdays and ended up sleeping one more on weekend days. So, overall, they just cut about three hours of sleep out of their week. Was that enough to result in any weight-loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80 percent of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group missing a few hours of sleep a week, it was the opposite with 80 percent of the loss being lean body mass.4632 This shows that a few hours of “catch-up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient. Indeed, it may in fact be contributing to the problem based on the social jet lag effect I described in the Chronobiology section.

A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year-olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by ninety minutes per night for a week and then switch the following week. On the days they slept less, they ate an average of 134 more calories and gained about a half pound compared to the sleep-more week.4633 The exciting question then becomes: Would sleeping more facilitate weight loss?

How to Get a Good Night’s Sleep

In the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study, women who got five or fewer hours of sleep a night gained about six more pounds over the subsequent sixteen years than those getting seven hours of sleep a night.4644 Even if that were due solely to the difference in sleep, that’s still only six pounds for more than ten thousand additional hours of sleep. If even a tiny fraction of that time were spent on diet and exercise, such as biking to the nearest farm stand, more weight could have been lost in sixteen weeks than during those sixteen years. Every little bit helps, though, which is the theme of this entire Weight-Loss Boosters section, and getting at least seven hours of sleep is probably healthier anyway.4645

The biggest reason to lose sleep over losing sleep is motor vehicle accident risk.4646 Driving while drowsy increases your risk of killing yourself and others.4647 People might think twice about getting behind the wheel after staying awake for forty-eight hours straight, but even just two weeks of sleeping only six hours a night impairs our cognitive performance as much as pulling two all-nighters in a row.4648 So what’s the best way to sleep better?

Sleeping pills are a nonstarter. People prescribed fewer than eighteen pills a year of hypnotics, the class of sleeping pills that includes Ambien, appear to have triple the hazard of dying prematurely.4649 Since up to 10 percent of the adult population is prescribed these drugs,4650 if those pills really are killing people, that could mean a six-figure death toll every year.4651 Ambien’s manufacturer questioned the study,4652 but it was just one of two dozen studies that found a significant association between sleeping pills and premature death.4653 When the principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic Sleep Center was criticized for “reporting alarmingly high death risks from commonly used medications,”4654 he replied: “We cannot hide risks, even if they might frighten patients out of taking hypnotics. Patients have a right to know.”4655

What’s more, nonpharmacological methods have been found to work as well or even better than the drugs.4656 The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is “cognitive behavioral therapy,” which combines conditioning techniques to reassociate the bed with sleep and education surrounding optimal sleep hygiene.4657

Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning:4658

Go to bed only when you’re sleepy.
Only use the bed for sleep (and sex). No reading, eating, or screen time.
If you can’t fall asleep within fifteen to twenty minutes or so, get up, leave the bedroom, and don’t go back until you’re sleepy again. Repeat as necessary.
Get up at the same time every morning no matter how little sleep you have had.
Although avoiding napping is often added to the list, contrary to expectations, the majority of research does not show that daytime naps interfere with nighttime sleep.4659

Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene:4660

Exercise regularly.
Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime.
Make the bedroom dark, cool, comfortable, and quiet.
Establish a relaxing bedtime routine.
The best time to exercise to improve sleep appears to be four to eight hours before bedtime,4661 though it appears to be a myth that exercising right before bed is somehow disruptive to sleep.4662

Efforts to replicate the nearly quarter-century-old study I mentioned in the Fat Burners section here showing even morning coffee may impair sleep4663 have yet to be attempted.4664 However, it’s clear that hefty caffeine doses up to six hours before bedtime interfere with sleep. Late-afternoon alcohol consumption (six hours before bedtime) may also impair sleep.4665 Additionally, nicotine, whether from gum, pill, patch, vape, or cigarette, may have negative sleep effects4666—though active nicotine withdrawal may as well.4667

Nocturnal noise can adversely impact sleep even if you’re not consciously aware of it. Within a few days, you can become habituated to noises such that they no longer wake you up, but EEG studies and subjective sleep surveys show the quality of our sleep can still be affected.4668 Earplugs and sound masking, such as with a white noise machine, have been shown to help.4669 I was kicking myself after I ordered a white noise machine to try out only to then realize there are around a gazillion free white noise apps available for my phone.

Relaxation techniques, such as massage,4670 mindfulness meditation,4671 and soothing music,4672 may also help. So, too, may taking a relaxing hot bath or shower. One of the reasons late-night eating can delay sleep is that it may interfere with the drop in core body temperature that normally occurs around bedtime,4673 which is thought to be one of the cues that it’s time for bed. So wouldn’t that make a hot shower counterproductive? No. As soon as you step out of the bath, your rapid decline in skin temperature can accentuate the natural nighttime drop and improve sleep.4674 Even just a warm footbath may help you fall asleep about fifteen minutes faster.4675

Food-wise, low fiber intake and high saturated fat and sugar intakes are associated with lighter, less restorative sleep.4676 Meat intake is associated with napping, suggested to be a proxy for inadequate sleep.4677 This may help explain why insomnia has been reported as a side effect of ketogenic diets.4678 I talked about melatonin-rich foods and supplements in the Chronobiology section. Megadoses of vitamin D were found to improve sleep duration and quality in men and women aged twenty through fifty with sleeping disorders, though no associated weight loss was reported.4679

Stress Belly

Under stress, we tend not only to eat more food but worse food, and we seem to deposit more fat in the worst place, in and around our abdominal organs. Cortisol, known as the stress hormone, may be the reason stress levels correlate with visceral obesity (deep belly fat).4692 Cortisol has been alleged to be a potential “kingpin” in the obesity epidemic.4693

We are now at a time in human history where most of our stressors may be psychological rather than physical. These days, we’re more likely to fight with our spouses than a saber-toothed tiger, but our bodies respond the same way—we produce cortisol.4694 Within seconds of a stressor, we get that fight-or-flight burst of adrenaline release, followed within minutes or hours with a rise in cortisol, which is secreted by our adrenal glands above our kidneys.4695 One effect of cortisol is to boost our appetites, which is adaptive if the stress is a physical threat, such as a predator or famine, but maladaptive if that stress is just trouble at work or financial insecurity—and particularly if the stressor is worrying about your weight!

If you covertly inject people with a drug that increases cortisol levels and then give them a basket of snacks, they eat about 140 more calories than if they had been injected with a placebo instead.4696 That’s why cortisol-like drugs are sometimes given to cancer patients who are wasting away: Corticosteroids may stimulate their appetites,4697 explaining why weight gain is a common side effect of these drugs.4698 Four days on the cortisol-like drug methylprednisolone (sold as Medrol, which is used in many autoimmune diseases) can boost daily intake nearly 60 percent, resulting in more than 1,000 extra calories consumed a day.4699 Cortisol has been implicated as a factor in motivating food intake even when we’re not really hungry.4700

The weight gain caused by cortisol isn’t uniform across the body, however. Fat cells deep in our bellies have a greater density of cortisol receptors,4701 which activate the enzyme that stuffs our fat cells with fat.4702 There’s a disease called Cushing’s syndrome that is characterized by an extreme excess of cortisol (for example, due to an adrenal gland tumor). The distribution of cortisol receptors of different regions of fat explains why abdominal obesity is a hallmark symptom of Cushing’s, which can be resolved once cortisol levels are brought under control.4703 There’s even been the suggestion that the accumulation of visceral fat is the body’s way of sopping up excess cortisol to help buffer the effects of stress.4704

So are people with higher levels of cortisol in their bloodstreams more likely to gain weight and become obese? This has actually been a difficult research question to answer because there are such wide, day-to-day fluctuations in cortisol based on stress levels.4705 Even just getting stuck in traffic on the day of the blood test could throw things off. But a new, noninvasive method has been developed to measure long-term average cortisol levels, involving a snip of hair rather than a vial of blood. As our hair grows, it traps a snapshot of cortisol in our bloodstreams at the time. Each inch of hair on our heads represents about three months of cortisol levels, growing out like rings in a tree trunk.4706 With this new research tool, scientists have been able to show that high cortisol levels over time are indeed associated with measures of abdominal fat.4707 One study of thousands of children found that higher hair cortisol levels were linked to a whopping nine times the odds of obesity by age six.4708

Might the stress of dieting increase cortisol levels? Although total fasting can dramatically increase cortisol levels—as much as doubling them within five days4709—less severe caloric restriction does not.4710 There is a way stress and obesity could turn into a vicious cycle, though: weight stigma.4711



****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
It Can Weigh on You

Even after controlling for body size, those who report weight discrimination may end up with 33 percent higher chronic cortisol levels, meaning even at the same weight, those who experience stigma appear significantly more stressed.4712 That may account for some of the correlation between stress and obesity.4713 The researchers suggest, “Chronic exposure to elevated levels of cortisol may play a role in generating a vicious circle of weight gain and discrimination.”4714

The weight of the stigma can be demonstrated experimentally. Researchers from Rutgers and UCLA set up an ethically questionable test. Women were invited to participate in a study allegedly designed to examine the “hormonal responses to shopping.” The study subject entered a staging area along with a “thin female confederate” who posed as just another study participant but was actually in on the experiment. The slim conspirator was then congratulated on the great news that she qualified to participate in a group shopping activity for designer clothing and was escorted into a celebration. After returning to the staging area, the researcher told the real study subject one of two manipulations. In the control condition, she was told, “Unfortunately, the group shopping activity is full now, and since you were the last to sign up, we can’t include you in the activity.” However, those randomized to the stigma condition were instead told, “Unfortunately, your size and shape just aren’t ideal for this style of clothing and we really do want everyone to have fun and feel good. Plus, we want to return the clothing to the designer in good condition.” Ouch. Irrespective of their actual weight, study subjects who perceived themselves to be heavy experienced a rise in cortisol within thirty minutes in the stigma compared to control condition.4715

Even just observing weight stigma can be stressful. Compared to cortisol levels measured after watching an emotionally neutral video (like a clip about the invention of the radio), women watching a stigmatizing scene, such as an actress in a fat suit dancing seductively for a group of repulsed construction workers, experienced greater cortisol secretion.4716 Does this then translate into increased calorie consumption? Yale researchers found that when normal-weight women are provided with bowls of M&M’s, jelly beans, and chips to snack on after watching clips of stigmatizing material like clumsy, loud, lazy stereotypes getting teased about their weight, they eat about the same amount compared to watching neutral material such as insurance commercials. But when overweight women watch the same two sets of videos, they triple their caloric intakes after watching the stigmatizing scenes.4717 A similar finding was reported for overweight youth, who were more likely to respond to being socially ostracized with overeating compared to normal-weight kids.4718

You can dress up skinny people in fat suits and get the same result. The UCLA research team who had helped design the shopping study published a paper entitled “Putting on Weight Stigma” in which slim men and women were randomized to appear obese by wearing a fat suit. Just walking around in public for a few minutes while wearing a fat suit led to hurt feelings of rejection, anger, anxiety, and sadness.4719 Immediately afterward, those in fat suits went on to consume nearly two hundred more calories of chips, chocolate, and soda—and that all occurred even without the internalized stigma, self-blame, and shame that too often plague the truly obese.4720 Ironically, this experience of “walking a mile in their shoes” appeared to have zero effect on the skinny study subjects’ own anti-fat attitudes.

No one should ever be discriminated against unfairly, but given the current reality, the most effective way to lose the weight stigma may be to lose the weight. That’s what this entire book is about, but what are some of the best ways to deal with stress, whether from stigma or otherwise?

Sweat It Out?

Exercise can have a powerful stress-buffering effect. People who regularly exercise report significantly lower stress levels, and when put to the test, randomized controlled trials have shown that acute bouts of exercise are effective in reducing self-reported stress levels and improving quality of life. Physically active individuals have lower cortisol levels and a healthier cortisol response to stressors.4721

One of the most popular experimental methods to induce psychological stress is the Montreal Imaging Stress Task protocol. It involves timed arithmetic challenges with failure built in by manipulating the difficulty and time limits to be just beyond the individual’s mental capacity.4722 When you put a group of sedentary individuals through the test, their cortisol spikes higher than aerobically fit subjects, but have them walk on a treadmill for thirty minutes before the test, and their cortisol responses drop right down.4723

Is the drop in cortisol from even just a single exercise session enough to blunt stress-induced eating? To find out, researchers put people through a mental challenge stressful enough to increase post-test pizza consumption by an additional hundred calories. If you first have them do fifteen minutes of high-intensity interval training, though, they end up eating less than they would have without doing the mental challenge. Combined with the calories burned by the exercise, they ended up with about one hundred fewer calories than they would have had they just sat down to the pizza alone.4724 So exercising to relieve stress can help control weight from both sides of the calorie equation.


Laugh It Off?

Exercising your funny bone doesn’t appear to do much on paper. Genuine voiced laughter only causes about a 10–20 percent increase in calorie expenditure above resting metabolic rate, which is not much more than such activities as light clerical work, writing, or playing cards. Ten to fifteen minutes of laughter a day may only burn about an extra ten to forty calories, depending on body weight and laughter intensity,4725 but laughter can have an oversized effect on lowering stress.

The very evolution of laughter is thought to have been as an antidote to stress, the release of nervous energy.4726 Within sixty minutes of people watching a comedy video (complete with “Gallagher’s classical Sledge-O-Matic finale”), cortisol levels in their bloodstreams were cut by more than half.4727 This has been offered as an explanation as to why mirthful laughter has been shown to improve immune function.4728 Cortisol acts as an immunosuppressant, which is why cortisol-like steroids such as prednisone are used for inflammatory autoimmune diseases. This may explain why those laughing heartily at a humorous video had improvements in natural killer cell function—critical for anticancer and antiviral immunity—compared to those randomized to a control group watching tourism videos.4729 (Replicating the results these days may be difficult given the original researchers’ choice of comedic stimulus: Bill Cosby.)

Under the assumption that our bodies can’t tell the difference between real and fake laughter, “laughter yoga” was developed4730 in which participants force themselves to laugh as a form of exercise “akin to internal jogging.”4731 Drops in cortisol levels have been noted when it has been put to the test, but would spontaneous laughter be better? 4732 Researchers in Japan decided to find out. They compared the cortisol changes in people randomized either to simulated laughter in a laughter yoga session, genuine laughter watching a funny video, or no laughter in a control group given some dry reading instead. Both laughter groups actively reduced cortisol levels within half an hour compared to the reading group, but the comedy group beat out the laughter yoga.4733 Maybe our bodies can tell if we’re faking it after all.


Strike a Pose?

What about regular yoga? Practiced by as many as twenty million Americans every year,4734 yoga in the United States is comprised mainly of body postures, breathing exercises, and meditation.4735 A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that yoga interventions can lower cortisol levels, but does this translate into weight loss? 4736 A cross-sectional study found that practicing yoga for four or more years was associated with less weight gain over time, but yoga practitioners also tended to exercise twice as much in general and eat more healthful diets (for example, 45 percent higher consumption of fruits and vegetables).4737 This may all be related, though. Yoga practitioners often claim they feel “more connected” to their bodies, which may translate into healthier choices.4738 However, you can’t tell what role yoga itself plays until it’s put to the test.

There are randomized controlled yoga trials showing weight loss, but they’re often in comparison to control groups who did nothing. Indeed, compared to no changes in physical activity, doing about thirty hours of yoga has been shown to lead to about five pounds of weight loss and an inch off the waist.4739,4740 But are there some supplemental benefits to yoga beyond just the three or so calories burned per minute4741 due to the physical exertion alone? Researchers decided to find out.

Yoga was compared head-to-head to resistance exercise and walking for weight loss. Doing thirty-six hours of resistance training with rubber exercise bands, weights, and balance balls led to a 1 percent drop in body fat compared to the sedentary control group. Doing the same amount of yoga led to the same 1 percent drop.4742 In the walking study, fulfilling my Daily Dozen recommendation to walk at least a total of ninety minutes a day on a plant-based diet also led to similar amounts of weight loss compared to swapping in the same amount of yoga—about five pounds and an inch off the waist in fifteen days.4743 The walking group were told to walk at their own pace, which ended up being more of a leisurely stroll, but that matched the metabolic cost of most yoga, which is classified by American College of Sports Medicine criteria as a light-intensity physical activity.4744

What about Bikram—or hot—yoga, practiced at a humid 100°F and purported to burn a thousand calories a session? That’s a bit of a stretch. (Ahem.) When put to the test, calorie expenditure during hot yoga was no more fat-burning than room-temperature yoga.4745 Overall, yoga doesn’t appear to have any special weight-reducing benefits,4746 but the best form of exercise is the one you’ll actually do, so if you enjoy it, go for it. Namaste.


Turn It Up?

What about music to soothe the savage beast of stress? We’ve been playing music since at least the Paleolithic era forty thousand years ago,4751 and music as therapy has been documented at least since biblical times (1 Samuel 16:23). The first music therapy experiment I could find was published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1914. Explaining why a phonograph was placed in the operating room as his patients lay fully conscious and awake during surgery, the surgeon said it was “a means of calming and distracting my patients from the horror of the situation.”4752

Now that we have good general anesthesia, music is used to calm nerves before surgery. Normally, we use Valium-type drugs like midazolam (sold as Versed), but they can have a variety of side effects, including, ironically, sometimes making people even more agitated.4753 A study from Sweden sought to determine if relaxing music has a greater anxiety-reducing effect than a standard dose of midazolam. Researchers whipped out some Kenny G, and the music indeed worked significantly better than the drug. Those listening to soft jazz, relaxing pop, classical, new age, and nature sounds all had lower anxiety scores, heart rates, and blood pressures. This was heralded as the first time any antianxiety therapy worked not only as well as but even better than Valium-type drugs, and it didn’t leave patients with the typical “post-operative hangover.” The researchers noted that the “difference in side effects of relaxing music and midazolam is obvious.”4754

Listening to music while eating does not seem to affect intake,4755 and though I couldn’t find any studies putting music to the test for weight loss, more than a dozen studies have found that listening to recorded music can reduce cortisol levels.4756 Not all music, though. Subjectively, Mozart has been found to lead to a greater self-reported reduction in tension than grunge rock (Pearl Jam).4757 When cortisol lowering was measured, Beethoven beat out techno (Techno Magnetiko’s Cyber Trip Techno Shock), but that may just be a function of the tempo.4758 People get the same bump in breathing and blood pressure listening to fast classical music, such as Vivaldi’s “Summer Presto,” which was as stimulating or even more so, researchers found, than the Red Hot Chili Peppers (the band, not the plants).4759

What about heavy metal? Kenneled dogs were provided with various Spotify options for audio enrichment.4760 Soft rock and reggae appeared to reduce stress, but the “loud and sudden nature of heavy metal may be unsuitable for dogs” as well as the “general experience of shelter employees and potential adopters.”4761 (Maybe they should have played Ozzy’s “Bark at the Moon.”) When people were randomly assigned to self-selected music, classical, heavy metal, or silence, the self-selected and classical music produced increased feelings of relaxation, as did sitting in silence, but heavy metal had the opposite effect.4762

Compared to relaxing and pleasant Renaissance music, exposure to “arousing and unpleasant” heavy metal caused a heightened amylase response in men.4763 Amylase is an enzyme in our saliva that digests starch into simple sugars. When we go into fight-or-flight mode, we immediately start churning out the enzyme to provide blood sugar for quick energy, so you get a spike when you go skydiving,4764 if someone dunks you in near-freezing water,4765 or, apparently, if you just listen to heavy metal for ten minutes.4766 With all that extra enzyme, if you’re eating bread while banging your head, you may end up digesting it faster.



Change Your Mind?

Mindfulness-based stress reduction involves cultivating a nonjudgmental, accepting, moment-by-moment awareness.4767 In the context of food, mindful eating is the practice of being fully present for a meal. This may involve slowing down the pace, savoring every bite, and getting in tune with your body’s fullness cues.4768 When we’re distracted, we tend to eat faster and for longer. For example, men and women randomized to eat while watching TV averaged an extra slice of pizza or 71 percent more mac ’n cheese, totaling nearly three hundred additional calories.4769 This may help explain why one survey found overweight individuals reported they ate almost half their meals while watching television.4770 Researchers at the Stanford Prevention Research Center found that on the weekends, about a quarter of a child’s calories may be consumed in front of the TV.4771

Even just being distracted listening to something can have an impact. Study subjects told to eat while giving their full attention to a radio conversation4772 or a detective story recorded on cassette tapes (old-school podcast!) ended up eating significantly more, for instance up to 77 percent more ice cream compared to undistracted eating.4773 Even just engaging in conversation while eating with friends can inadvertently boost intake.4774

Distracted eating may also affect subsequent consumption. Have people play computer solitaire while eating a fixed-calorie meal, and they eat nearly twice as many cookies a half hour later, as if they hadn’t fully consciously registered how much they ate while they were distracted by the game.4775 Conversely, if you have people listen to an audio clip encouraging them to eat mindfully and focus on the look, smell, taste, and texture of the food, they eat fewer cookies hours later than those who had either eaten in silence4776 or while listening to neutral audiobook content.4777 Another way mindful eating may help prevent overeating is by sharpening the memory of each meal. Those who could more reliably recall an experimental lunch have been shown to average lower afternoon snack intake.4778 Most but not all such studies found focused attention during a meal decreased later food intake, at least in a research lab setting.

How to Deal with Cravings

Attending to the sensory qualities of food and our bodies’ reactions is just one aspect of mindful eating. Mindfulness has been described as a “moment-to-moment awareness, cultivated by paying attention in a specific way, in the present moment, as non-reactively, nonjudgmentally, and openheartedly as possible.”4780 Just being aware may not be enough, though. Practicing mindfulness is said to involve three steps: awareness, acceptance, and then something called cognitive defusion.

When we are struck with a craving, a typical reaction is cognitive restructuring, a psychological term for challenging our thoughts and replacing them with alternative ones.4781 For example, if we’re hit with a pang for chocolate, instead of reaching for a candy bar, a restructuring response might be: No, I don’t need chocolate. I can have something healthier instead. Unfortunately, this rarely works. More than one hundred self-identified chocolate cravers were randomized to an hour of cognitive restructuring instruction and then given a bag of chocolates to carry around with them for a week to see how well they could resist the temptation. Despite the hour-long instruction at the start of the week, they didn’t do much better than the control group who tried the same exercise but without any instruction at all.

The mindful eating approach, on the other hand, involved cognitive defusion. People are taught to defuse their thoughts as “merely thoughts” and place mental distance between themselves and their thoughts. A defusion response to the thought of needing chocolate would involve simply observing the thought (I notice I’m having the thought that I need to eat some chocolate) and thanking one’s mind for the thought (Thanks, mind).4782 A “mindbus” metaphor is used, in which people are taught to imagine themselves as the driver of a bus and their thoughts as mere passengers.4783 You visualize yourself taking control as you stop the bus and let off the negative passengers. Thanks for the feedback, folks, but this is my bus.

Cognitive defusion was tested head-to-head against cognitive restructuring in the same chocolate experiment, and those who had gotten an hour of defusion instruction had three times greater odds of remaining “chocolate abstinent” in the face of a week of constant temptation.4784 Defusion was then pitted against acceptance: Instructing people to observe a thought or feeling, accept its presence, and build up a degree of tolerance for uncomfortable feelings. Study subjects were randomized to less than a half hour of coaching on either defusion or acceptance, or to a control group who spent the time learning a muscle-relaxation technique. They were then asked to carry a bag of chocolate candy with them for five days—untouched. The acceptance group failed to beat out the control group, but the defusion group did.4785 Of all the mindfulness skills, cognitive defusion, also known as disidentification, appears to be the most effective.

Putting Your Mind at Rest

Putting all the studies together, the latest and largest review published in 2018 did find that mindfulness-based interventions can lead to weight loss compared to doing nothing, an average of about seven pounds over four months or so.4812 Pitted head-to-head, however, they didn’t beat out other lifestyle-change interventions, but the nice thing about stress management and mindfulness is they can be practiced on top of whatever else you’re doing.


Get Planted

A single high-fat meal can exacerbate the effects of stress. People randomized to eat a sausage-and-egg McMuffin with hash browns experienced a heightened cardiovascular reactivity to both psychological stress (public speaking) and bodily stress (submerging their hand in ice water for minutes) two hours later. How do we know it wasn’t just the carbs in the english muffin and hash browns? Because the control meal was a sugary mess of Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops, and those randomized to the breakfast candy reacted significantly better to the stressors than those in the high-fat group. The McMuffin meal also had more than ten times the cholesterol, thanks to the egg, and the researchers suggest this may also have contributed to the effect.4813 Population studies show that higher dietary cholesterol is associated significantly with increased risk of impaired cognitive function and memory, effectively mimicking accelerated brain aging. The effect of eating an additional 80 mg of cholesterol a day—which is less than half an egg4814—was similar to the effect of being approximately three years older, appearing to effectively accelerate brain aging.4815

Though effectively all dietary cholesterol comes from animal foods, saturated fat is not exclusive to the animal kingdom. Remember the packs-a-punch study from the Anti-Inflammatory section showing just a few days of a breakfast high in saturated fat can cause learning and memory problems? The researchers used palm oil, so it’s not just animal fats. Tropical oils, including palm and coconut oils, are highly saturated, too, though the vast majority of saturated fat in the American diet continues to come from meat and dairy. Every single one of the top fifteen sources of saturated fat is meat, dairy, or junk.4816 What would happen if we instead centered our diets around whole, healthy, plant foods?

In a study published in Nutritional Neuroscience entitled “Vegans Report Less Stress and Anxiety Than Omnivores,” those eating completely plant-based do seem to be significantly less stressed, but it may not necessarily be their diets. The researchers suggest it’s because they’re eating less pro-inflammatory animal fats, but those eating more plant-based also tended to exercise more, spend more time outdoors, and practice more yoga. The omnivores also reported dieting more often, which alone can be stressful.4817

Even if it is the diet, it could be the anti-inflammatory compounds in fruits and vegetables rather than the “cascade of neuroinflammation” (brain inflammation) potentially caused by the arachidonic acid4818 (an inflammatory omega-6 fat) concentrated in chicken and eggs4819 or the saturated fat in red meat and dairy.4820 It could also be because of all the beneficial prebiotics in whole grains and beans. Researchers performed a fecal transplant between stress-prone mice and normal mice by feeding them each other’s stool, and the normal mice started exhibiting anxiety and the stressed mice relaxed.4821 You don’t know for sure until you put it to the test—in people. No studies as of yet trading poop with the Dalai Lama, but there have been interventional trials using plant-based diets.

Five hundred men and women suffering from anxiety and depression were placed on a whole food, plant-based diet and lifestyle program. Most dropped out within the first two weeks because they felt the program was “too rigorous” for them. However, the majority of those who stuck with the program experienced substantial improvements in mood and a “large improvement or full remission” of anxiety symptoms. Most who had been suffering from fatigue and pain got better and, over the twelve-week study period, lost an average of six pounds. What was most remarkable is that three months after the study ended, they were down a total of fifteen pounds, suggesting they stuck with it on their own. Exercise and twenty minutes of relaxation a day were also prescribed with the whole food, plant-based diet, though, so it’s impossible to isolate out the effects of what they ate.4822

There are randomized controlled trials of plant-based diets that have resulted in significant improvements in anxiety, fatigue, depression, and emotional well-being utilizing dietary changes alone,4823 but is that directly because of the diet or indirectly due to the augmented weight loss? Even placed on similar caloric intakes, plant-based diets can result in superior weight loss, with significant reductions in all compartments of body fat.4824 Maybe that’s why the subjects reported a greater improvement in quality of life compared to the control group.4825 The reason we suspect the causal link may be direct is that if you randomize people to remove all meat and eggs from their diets, you can get a significant drop in stress levels within just two weeks, compared to those who kept eating fish or a third group who continued to include all animal foods. So even before significant weight loss could occur, the researchers suggest “individuals who eliminate meat, fish, and poultry may cope better with mental stress.”

The Meat of the Matter

A single meal high in animal protein can nearly double the level of the stress hormone cortisol in the blood within a half hour of consumption, more than twice that of a meal closer to the recommended level of protein.4827 Give someone a meal of crabmeat, tuna, and cottage cheese, and the level of cortisol in their saliva shoots up within the hour. Instead, give someone some barley soup and a vegetable stir-fry, and cortisol levels drop down after the meal.4828 Imagine eating meat or dairy meal after meal, day after day. The concern is you might “chronically stimulate” your adrenal glands.4829 We don’t always have control over the stress in our lives, but at least we can make some dietary tweaks to help keep cortisol under control.

Chronic high cortisol levels don’t just increase obesity risk. Blood cortisol strongly predicts cardiovascular death in men and women—even among those without any known preexisting cardiovascular disease.4830 This may help explain “death from a broken heart,” the heightened heart attack and stroke risk in the weeks immediately following the loss of a spouse.4831 The higher cortisol levels days, months, or even years after losing someone you love may increase cardiac risk and reduce immune function. Remarkably, the rise in stress hormone levels after losing a spouse4832 is less than the bump you may get eating a high-meat diet.4833

If you feed men a high-protein diet packed with fish, poultry, other meat, and egg whites, and then switch them to a lower-protein diet centered around bread, fruits, and vegetables, their cortisol levels drop about a quarter within ten days.4834 Interestingly, at the same time, their testosterone levels shoot up by about the same amount. Contrary to the “flagrant misuse of scientific information” in Men’s Health magazine,4835 high-protein diets suppress testosterone.4836 That’s why if men eating plant-based diets begin eating meat every day, their testosterone levels go down,4837 which, over time, might itself contribute to the accumulation of belly fat.



Controlling Cortisol from Birth

The spikes in cortisol levels that occur each time we eat a meaty meal4839 may not just affect our health but that of our children. Substantial evidence now suggests that high-protein diets during pregnancy have adverse effects on the fetus.4840 Take, for example, the infamous Harlem Trial of 1976. Poor black pregnant women were randomized into one of three groups, either getting forty grams of added animal protein a day, an additional six grams, or none. The added-protein groups suffered an excess of very early premature births, with infant death rates doubling in the six-gram group and quadrupling in the forty-gram group. The babies who survived suffered “significant growth retardation.”4841

In a similar experiment in Scotland, pregnant women were told to eat a high-meat diet in hopes of preventing a disease of pregnancy known as preeclampsia.4842 It didn’t work. In fact, the lowest preeclampsia rates I’ve ever come across were among women eating completely plant-based diets: only 1 case out of 775 pregnancies.4843 Preeclampsia normally strikes about 1 in 20,4844 so a plant-based diet might “alleviate most, if not all, of the signs and symptoms of this potentially serious condition.”4845

What happened when the Scottish women went from eating about one daily portion of meat to around two a day? The mothers who ate more meat during pregnancy gave birth to children who grew up to have higher blood pressures.4846 One explanation for the adverse effects of high meat consumption, including fish, is that this may have increased maternal cortisol concentrations, which in turn affected the developing fetus, resetting their stress hormone “thermostat” to a higher level. Indeed, researchers found higher blood cortisol levels in both the sons and daughters of women who had reported higher consumption of meat, including fish—about a 5 percent increase for every daily serving.4847 This may help explain why animal protein intake during pregnancy has been associated with children becoming overweight later in life.



You Are What Your Mother Ate
Whereas babies of meat-free mothers have lower cortisol levels,4849 higher-meat diets are considered to present a “metabolic stress” to the mother, effectively reprograming the adrenal glands of their children, leading to lifelong elevations of stress hormones in their blood.4850 Every daily portion of meat consumed during late pregnancy was linked to about a 1 percent greater fat mass in their children by the time they reached adolescence.4851

The adult children of mothers who ate more meat during pregnancy don’t just walk around with higher baseline stress hormone levels but also appear to react more negatively to whatever life throws at them. Researchers tracked down the now grown-up kids whose mothers had been part of the double-the-meat experiment and measured their cortisol levels after a stressful public-speaking challenge. If their moms had eaten fewer than two daily servings of meat (fish included) while carrying them, they got relatively small surges of stress hormones from their adrenal glands. The cortisol levels in those whose moms had eaten fourteen to sixteen servings a week rose 30 percent higher, and those whose moms had eaten the most meat—seventeen or more servings a week—had their cortisol levels jump more than 50 percent higher in response to the same imposed stress.4852

It’s no surprise then that animal-protein intake during pregnancy may lead to greater weight gain for her children later in life,4853 but remarkably, it may even impact her grandchildren. Recent evidence suggests that the long-term adverse consequences may not be limited to one generation, potentially affecting the ovaries and future eggs of her unborn daughter. “Ultimately,” one review concluded, “these findings will shed light on the transmission of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease that are rapidly expanding in Western countries.”


FOOD FOR THOUGHT

The best way to relieve the effects of stress is to relieve the stress itself. To the extent possible, we should try to reorient our lives to avoid major stressors and use exercise to work off what’s unavoidable. This can include yoga, walking, or resistance band stretches. Mindfulness techniques can be used to reduce stress and deal with cravings. To buffer the release of the stress hormone cortisol, we can reduce our intake of saturated fats and animal protein, and pile on the plants.

WALL OFF YOUR CALORIES

Liquid Candy Crush

In the Eating Rate booster section, I discussed the classic jelly bean-versus-soda study that showed our bodies may not register calories in liquid form as well as they do calories from solid foods. If you’re given an extra one hundred calories, your body tries to take that into account, adjusting your appetite over the remainder of the day so you stay in relative calorie balance. This response isn’t perfect, though; your body isn’t able to completely compensate calorie for calorie. In studies where this has been measured, those given an extra one hundred calories of food end up eating an average of only sixty-four fewer calories later on, not the full hundred. But if you drink those hundred extra calories, your body hardly seems to notice, only downregulating your subsequent appetite by about nine calories.4855 So by the end of the day, you may be left with a ninety-one-calorie surplus. Our brains just don’t seem wired to recognize liquid calories. After all, for millions of years, the only thing on tap was water.

This may help explain why sugary drinks have been blamed as perhaps the single largest driver of the obesity epidemic,4856 accounting for at least one-fifth of the weight gained between 1977 and 2007 in the United States.4857 By the year 2000, Americans were drinking an estimated 190 calories a day of sweetened beverages.4858

It would be bad enough to eat 190 empty calories’ worth of candy a day, but it may be even worse to drink it.

It’s been estimated that just removing soda and other sugary drinks from the SNAP program (formerly known as Food Stamps) would prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of obesity.4859 Through the program, the soda industry is snatching up billions of taxpayer dollars every year.4860 The USDA has denied state requests for excluding soda from SNAP, arguing, “No clear standards exist for defining foods as good or bad, or healthy or not healthy.”4861 The fact that the federal government can’t even agree that sugar water is unhealthy explains a lot about the sad state of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines.

Industries argue that removing soda subsidies would disproportionately hurt the poor, like tobacco taxes. Of course, the public health community sees ending the subsidies as disproportionally helping the poor, but it might be more consistent to restrict the use of federal dollars across the board, such as at cafeterias in federal buildings and military bases, for example.4862 When those actually affected by the policy were asked (what a concept!), the majority of SNAP participants surveyed supported removing sugary drinks, especially if it led to additional benefits for healthful foods like fruits and vegetables.4863

Obesity, like lung cancer, is not an equal-opportunity killer. Those living in poverty are significantly more likely to become obese.4864 Predatory industries such as fast food,4865 alcohol,4866 and tobacco have long targeted low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.4867 The soda industry appears to be no exception.4868 As one tobacco industry executive was recorded saying, “We don’t smoke that s***. We just sell it. We just reserve the right to smoke for the young, the poor, the black and the stupid.”



Particle Physics

Liquefied meats, fruits, and vegetables appear to be less satiating than the same foods in solid form. Part of this is due to eating speed. You can eat applesauce four times faster than you can eat the same amount in whole-apple form.4881 However, even at approximately the same rate of ingestion, a chicken smoothie,4882 blended carrots,4883 and apple purée4884 were found to be less satisfying than their solid equivalents.

Part of it may be psychological. When researchers have tricked study subjects into falsely believing they had just consumed a liquid that would instantly gel in their stomachs, the subjects felt so much fuller that they ended up eating hundreds of fewer calories over the course of a day compared to those who had been given the same liquid without the lie.4885 However, there are also physiological reasons why the form food takes may be important for weight control.

Nuts are the classic example. Comparing the absorption of fat from peanuts to the exact same number of peanuts ground into peanut butter, you flush more than twice the amount of fat down the toilet when you eat the peanuts themselves.4886 No matter how well you chew, small bits of nuts trapping some of that oil make their way all the way through our systems and are lost out the other end.4887 Same number of calories going into our mouths, but because of the food structure—whole versus blended—fewer calories stay in our bodies. This introduces the concept of metabolizable energy. Remember, it’s not what you eat but what you absorb. For some foods, the calorie count on the label may not accurately reflect the calories that make it into your bloodstream.

Based on macronutrient content—4 calories per gram of protein or carbohydrate, and 9 calories per gram of fat—a can of almonds may list 180 calories per ounce. However, if you rummage through people’s stools after they had eaten an ounce of almonds, you may find that 55 almond calories had escaped. So the metabolizable energy of almonds is really only 125 calories per ounce, not the listed 180. Given that, whole nuts may have 30 percent fewer calories than you’d expect. In contrast, the calculated calories and metabolizable calories in almond butter are nearly identical.4888 You absorb the full complement of calories from nut and seed butters because none of the oil is trapped inside unchewed fragments.

Which has more calories? Raw almonds or dry, roasted almonds? They may have the same number listed on their respective labels, but raw almonds are harder nuts to crack. Roasting makes nuts more brittle, so they fracture into tinier pieces in our mouths. If you have people chew almonds and then spit them out without swallowing, the size of the particles of chewed raw almonds is twice the size of chewed roasted almonds. And indeed, you end up getting about 10 percent more metabolizable calories when eating roasted almonds than raw, since the roasted nuts get broken down so much smaller when you eat them.4889

Does this mean you absorb more calories from nuts if you chew them more? Researchers in Indiana decided to put it to the test. People ate about two ounces of nuts every day for four days while their stools were collected. Those instructed to chew ten times per mouthful lost about 25 percent more fecal fat compared to those told to chew twenty-five times.4890 Same food, same amount of food, yet nearly two hundred fewer calories absorbed based on how they ate them. One would expect the extended orosensory exposure from the extra chewing to suppress appetite, but the meal amounts were fixed so the study can’t show how much this might have compensated for the calorie deficit.

****************************************************************************************************
In Bad Form

The physical form of food can alter not only fat absorption but carbohydrate absorption as well. It comes as no surprise that Rice Krispies and Corn Flakes cause a much greater spike in blood sugars than rice or corn on the cob,4891 but it’s not just the added sugar in the cereals. Even with identical ingredients, food structure can make a big difference. For example, rolled oats have a significantly lower glycemic index than unsweetened instant oatmeal, which is also just straight oats but in thinner flakes,4892 and oat flakes cause lower blood sugar and insulin spikes than powdered oats.4893 The same single ingredient, oats, in different forms can have different effects.

Why do we care? As I noted in the Low Glycemic Load section, the overly rapid absorption of carbohydrates after eating a high-glycemic-index meal can trigger a sequence of hormonal and metabolic changes that promote excessive eating. In a study out of Harvard’s Children’s Hospital, a dozen obese teen boys were fed instant oatmeal versus steel-cut oatmeal. After the instant oatmeal, the teens went on to eat 53 percent more than after eating the exact same number of calories of steel-cut oatmeal. The instant oatmeal group was snacking within an hour after the meal and went on to accumulate significantly more calories throughout the rest of the day.4894 Same type of food, but different form, yielding different effects.

Steel-cut oatmeal is considered a low-glycemic-index food, averaging under 55. The glycemic index of instant oatmeal is 79, making it a high-glycemic-index food, but not as bad as some breakfast cereals, which can get into the 80s or 90s. This is even true of zero-sugar cereals like shredded wheat.4895 The new industrial methods used to create breakfast cereals, such as extrusion cooking and explosion puffing, accelerate starch digestion and absorption, causing an exaggerated blood sugar response.4896 Shredded wheat has the same ingredients as spaghetti—straight wheat—but twice the glycemic index.4897

When you eat spaghetti, you get a gentle rise in blood sugars.4898 If you eat the same amount of wheat baked into bread form, however, you get a big spike in blood sugars. All the little bubbles in bread allow our bodies to break it down so fast that it can cause our bodies to overreact with an insulin spike so large it can drive down our blood sugars below fasting levels. This hypoglycemic dip two hours after breaking bread can then trigger hunger sensations. Experimentally, if you infuse someone with insulin so their blood sugars fall, you can cause their hunger to rise4899 and, in particular, spike cravings for high-calorie foods.4900 In short, lower-glycemic-index foods may help us feel fuller longer than equivalent higher-glycemic-index foods.4901

A dramatic illustration of this effect was demonstrated by researchers at Columbia University. Individuals were randomized into one of three breakfast conditions—oatmeal made from quick oats, the same number of calories of Frosted Flakes, or just plain water—and then the researchers measured how much the subjects ate for lunch three hours later. Unsurprisingly, those who had eaten the oatmeal felt significantly fuller and less hungry after a few hours and indeed went on to eat significantly less lunch. Overweight participants in the oatmeal group ate less than half as many calories at lunch, hundreds of fewer calories compared to the other groups. How did the cereal group fare? The breakfast cereal was so unsatiating that the Frosted Flakes group ate as much lunch as the breakfast-skipping water-only group.4902 It’s as if the cereal group hadn’t eaten any breakfast at all.

Saving Scraps for Our Friendly Flora

White rice has a lower glycemic index than white potatoes, but only, evidently, because you end up swallowing larger particles. If you blend rice into a slurry, its glycemic index rises to match that of the potato.4903 The same is not true, however, of beans. Blended lentils have the same low glycemic index as whole lentils.4904 Even when cooked into a creamy dal, lentils have the same flattened blood sugar curve.4905 Whole beans, puréed beans, and powdered beans (like you’d find in bean pastas) all have the same low-glycemic response.4906 Legumes have thicker, fibrous cell walls that protect the inner starch from disruption during processing,4907 such that the early metabolic response to blended beans is the same, but it may be a different story hours later.

Researchers in Australia randomized people to eat the same whole foods, but during one week, the seeds, grains, beans, and chickpeas they were given were in more or less intact form, and during a different week, the foods were ground up. So, for example, for breakfast, the intact-grain group got muesli, while the ground-grain group got the same muesli but blended into a porridge. In the intact group, beans were added to salads, whereas in the ground group, they were blended into hummus. Note that during both weeks, the subjects were eating the same, whole, unrefined foods but, in one of the weeks, the whole grains, beans, chickpeas, and seeds were just made into flour or blended up.4908 So what happened?

The intact-grain diet doubled their stool size. They ate the same food and the same amount of food, yet ended up with twice the fecal bulk compared to the ground-grain diet.4909 Remember, most of our stool is pure bacteria. No matter how well we chew, when we eat the way nature intended, the little bits and pieces left behind when we swallow transport a smorgasbord of starch and other prebiotic nutrients straight down to our good bacteria, who get fruitful and multiply. Short-chain fatty-acid production shoots up, and we can bask in all the benefits I detailed in the Microbiome-Friendly section.

Just as our bodies weren’t designed to handle liquid calories, powdered grains also represent a novel challenge to our systems. In How Not to Die, I encouraged everyone to eat whole grains, but from an optimal weight-loss standpoint, that may be insufficient. Intact whole grains are superior to milled whole grains in the same way that whole grains are superior to refined grains. Whole-wheat bread is better than white bread because it has more fiber to feed our good bacteria. If we just ate refined grains, we would starve our microbial selves. But fiber is pretty much all whole-wheat flour has to offer our colonic colleagues. When whole grains are finely milled into flour, the rest of the nutrients are absorbed rapidly high up in the small intestine, leaving few leftovers. It still has the fiber, at least, so 100 percent whole-grain flour won’t leave our good gut bacteria completely starving, but they’ll certainly be left malnourished compared to if you had eaten an intact whole grain like brown rice, where you eat the entire kernels of grains instead of powder.


Structural Integrity

There’s a big difference between how small we can get food particles when we chew and how small they can be ground in a mill. The chomping of our teeth and the churning of our stomachs reduce the size of anything we eat down to under about two millimeters, about one-sixteenth of an inch, before entering our intestines.4910 That may sound small, but a two-millimeter particle of wheat would contain about 10,000 plant cells filled with starch, of which only approximately 3,800 would be ruptured open on their surface.4911 That would still leave 62 percent of the starch in that grain particle locked inside indigestible plant walls. Our starch-eating enzymes can diffuse through those walls and get at some of the starch inside, but a bounty will still be left over for our microbiomes.4912 In contrast, flour particles can be one hundred times smaller, even smaller than the size of the cells themselves, so nearly all may be ruptured open to spill their contents early, leaving our gut flora relatively high and dry.4913

The same goes for nuts and nut butters. Even a tiny two-millimeter nut particle has more than three hundred thousand oil-rich cells, less than 10 percent of which are exposed on the surface for early digestion.4914 This leaves a residual horn of plenty, shown experimentally to boost the growth of our gut flora.4915 In contrast, the specks found in ground nut butters average a thousand times smaller than the chewed particles of whole or chopped nuts, obliterating the cell walls and opening them for easy access.4916 This explains why feeding people almonds can alter their microbiomes for the better, boosting the growth of bugs that produce short-chain fatty acids, but feeding people the same amount of almond butter appears to have no prebiotic influence.4917

Remember the amazing second-meal effect where people fed beans at dinner aren’t as hungry at breakfast the next morning? 4918 When you eat nuts whole, not only do you feel fuller at the time compared to nut butter4919 (presumably because of all that extra chewing and orosensory stimulation), but you may also feel fuller hours later throughout the day.4920 If you feed people at dinner boiled rye berries, which are the intact rye kernels before they’re milled into rye bread, they eat less at lunch the next day, more than twelve hours later.4921 You do not, however, see that same second-meal effect on long-term satiety—or, in this case, a third-meal effect—with the same amount of milled rye porridge made from rye flour. The researchers suspect the appetite-suppressing benefits of eating structurally intact foods derive from the afterparty effects in our colons from the bountiful abundance.

The Matrix

To claim “whole grain” on a label, the food just has to contain more than 51 percent whole-grain ingredients.4923 So a “whole grain” product could be nearly half white flour and straight sugar. This is why you see “whole grain” plastered across the likes of Froot Loops, Trix, Lucky Charms, and Cocoa Puffs. Even most “100 percent” whole-wheat flour these days starts out as white flour and then has some bran and germ added to approximate the proportions of the original grain.4924 Stone-ground flour, which really is just crushed grains, can be 100 percent whole grain though the cellular structure is still obliterated.

Nearly a half century ago, the dietary fiber hypothesis was proposed, suggesting that fiber was the reason that diets centered around whole plant foods were so protective against chronic disease.4925 Predictably, this gave rise to a multibillion-dollar fiber supplement market.4926 (People could just eat real food, but where’s the money in that?) The problem is it didn’t work.4927 Yes, fiber supplements can help with constipation, but all the other purported benefits didn’t seem to materialize. Studies associating high fiber intake with lower risk of disease and death relate only to fiber from food intake rather than from fiber isolates or supplements.4928 You can’t just take your magic bullet of Metamucil with your Wonder Bread. That’s not how fiber works.

Fiber is a smuggler.

Dietary fiber alone has certain benefits, but its primary role may be to encapsulate nutrients for special delivery to our gut microbiomes. If there’s one recurring theme in this book, it’s wall off your calories. Make sure as many of your calories as possible—your protein, your carbs, your fat—are encased in cell walls. Cell walls are made out of fiber, which acts as an indigestible physical barrier, so when you eat structurally intact plant foods, many of the calories remain trapped. Chew all you want—you’re still going to end up with calories completely surrounded by fiber, which then blunts the glycemic response, activates the ileal brake, and delivers sustenance to your friendly flora. That’s what nature intended to happen.

The primary utility of fiber may be more as a vehicle to transport cached calories and nutrients. Fiber is a ferry. Now you can see why apples, “contrary to expectations,” were found to be more satiating than apple juice enriched with an identical amount of added fiber.4929 You can’t just sprinkle on the fiber. That’s not how fiber works. Fiber is the carrier. Fiber is the matrix. The word matrix comes from the Latin matricis, derived from mater, meaning mother.4930 We should strive to preserve the matrix (the blue pill, Neo) by choosing not just whole grains but intact grains.

As one review title put it, “Food Structure Is Critical for Optimal Health.”4931 We can preserve this “botanical integrity” of grains by sticking to whole kernels.4932 I was amused to see a paper in a journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry entitled “The Anti-Obesity Effect of Starch in a Whole Grain-Like Structural Form.”4933 Researchers at the Institute of Biotechnology and a food science lab found they could reduce weight gain in obese mice by embedding starch microspheres “in a biopolymer-based artificial matrix to form a whole g[r]ain-like structure.” If only Mother Nature had a ticker symbol on the stock exchange.



Broken Bread

Oil and sugar are examples of concentrated forms of “acellular” calories,4934 which have been blamed as a contributor to the obesity crisis.4935 Not only have the cells’ walls that once held them been ruptured, they’ve been removed completely. White flour is not far behind, with most of its fiber stripped away. Though 100 percent whole-wheat flour may have all its original fiber, the cellular structure has been disintegrated such that while the fiber is there, it’s not protectively wrapped around the starch. That’s why the glycemic index of intact wheat kernels (wheatberries) or even cracked wheat (like bulgur found in tabbouleh) is down around 45, but whole-wheat bread is nearly as bad as white bread with both up about 70.4936 There’s fiber floating around in that whole wheat, but the starch is still out there flapping in the breeze. (The sciency way of saying that is milling disrupts the “physical encapsulation of intracellular nutrients by cell walls of plant foods.”4937)

Researchers funded with dough from Big Bread assert that white bread’s weight-control concerns are “one of the most common mistakes and myths about nutrition.”4938 But what does the conflict-of-interest-free science say? In that famous satiety index study where dozens of foods were tested, three slices of bread were found to be less satisfying than the same number of calories of all foods except croissants, cake, donuts, and candy bars. Even jelly beans appeared a bit more satiating.4939 Whole-wheat bread does appear to be more filling than white,4940 but do these results translate into changes in weight?

Ecological studies, such as country-by-country comparisons of per capita bread supply and obesity rates, show no clear link.4941 They are considered a rather weak form of evidence, though, since data are analyzed at a population level, rather than an individual level. So while it’s true that average bread consumption has been declining in some countries while obesity rates have been rising, that doesn’t necessarily exonerate bread since we don’t know if the particular individuals who are eating more or less bread are the ones losing or gaining more weight. You could do a cross-sectional study to see if, in a snapshot in time, those who ate more bread are thinner or fatter, but you’d never know which came first, like in the candy and diet soda studies where one’s weight status may determine consumption, rather than the other way around.

Enter cohort studies, following individuals and their diets over time. Researchers in Spain found that over a period of four years, those who increased their white-bread consumption appeared to gain weight and abdominal fat, but no such effect was found for whole-grain bread.4942 The challenge with cohort studies is confounding. Maybe people who cut down on white bread also made other dietary changes. Indeed, those who stopped eating so much bread also tended to stop eating so much meat and started eating more fruits and vegetables. So maybe the bread itself had nothing to do with it. Maybe it was skipping the bologna in the bologna sandwich.

Whole-grain consumers exhibit a variety of other healthy dietary behaviors as well,4943 but statistical tools used to adjust for some of these other factors suggest white-bread consumption does indeed have negative health consequences.4944 Consistent results were also found in two other cohort studies that looked into bread. White-bread consumption appeared to be associated with greater belly fat and a significantly higher risk of becoming overweight or obese, whereas no such relationship was found for whole-grain bread.4945,4946

Aside from just whole-grain over white, which breads are better than others? From a glycemic-index standpoint, breads made from sprouted grains4947 or with added cracked wheat4948 are preferable. If you simply just must eat white bread, freezing and defrosting it lowers the blood sugar response, as does toasting4949 and the use of sourdough fermentation.4950 If you make your own bread at home, you can shorten the final rising time (proofing) to make a denser loaf, which has been found to lower the glycemic index and improve satiety.

Perhaps one way to test the healthfulness of a loaf is to see if it hurts if you drop it on your foot.

I was disappointed to learn that frozen bagels, even though the dough seems denser and they have the freeze-defrost cycle going for them, appear to cause the same exaggerated blood sugar spike as Wonder Bread.4951,4952

Some breads don’t just incorporate cracked grains but entire kernels. Bread with added wheatberries results in a lower glycemic index4953 and improved satiety compared to straight whole-wheat bread,4954 and pumpernickel bread, which often includes whole rye kernels, has comparably blunted blood sugar and insulin responses.4955 I thought the glycemic index of wheatberries was low at 45.4956 Rye berries are even lower at 34, perhaps due to their higher fiber content,4957 which is down around legume territory. This may explain why those randomized to eat whole-grain rye products for six weeks lost significantly more weight than those given refined wheat, but those given whole-wheat products instead did not.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

If you could only make one dietary change, getting rid of sugary beverages would be a good choice and one that is consistent with my advice to wall off your calories. That means eliminating soda sweetened with sugar or corn syrup, as well as other sugary drinks, both carbonated and uncarbonated, such as sports and energy drinks.

As I mentioned in the Fat Blockers section, I defined my Green Light category in How Not to Die as foods of plant origin to which nothing bad has been added and from which nothing good has been taken away. How is this different from my recommendation to wall off your calories, to ensure your protein, carbs, and fat are trapped within cell walls? After all, only plants have cell walls. (Animals are made up of cells with fluid membranes, requiring bones to hold them up, whereas plants have rigid cell walls made out of fiber.) So isn’t walling off calories the same as saying choose whole plant foods? The difference becomes apparent with examples of formless foods like powdered whole grains. Imagine a whole-grain cream of wheat cereal with one ingredient: 100 percent whole wheat. Or almond butter with one ingredient: almonds. Green Light, right? Plant foods to which nothing bad has been added and from which nothing good has been taken away. But now we know something good has been taken away: the structure.

The reason I have always considered whole-grain pasta to be a Green Light food, but whole-grain bread, even if it’s 100 percent whole grain, as a Yellow Light food, had nothing to do with the structure. It was all due to Green Light’s “nothing bad added” caveat. Bread-makers add salt, making bread a leading contributor of sodium intake, second only to chicken for most American adults.4976 If we all just reduced our salt intake by about a half teaspoon a day, we could potentially prevent between 86,000 and 165,000 strokes and heart attacks and save 44,000 to 92,000 lives in the United States every year.4977

Eating whole grains is good, but eating whole-grain kernels is better. Former Harvard nutrition chair Walter Willett has argued that the term whole grain should probably be reserved for only whole intact grain kernels.4978 So eat the wholiest of grains: intact grains, also known as groats.

Take oats, for example. They’re found out in the fields as oat groats and then have their inedible outer husks removed during processing.4979 Groats can then be sliced into two to four pieces to make steel-cut (also known as pinhead or Irish) oats, coarsely ground into Scottish oatmeal, or steamed and flattened into “old-fashioned” rolled oats.4980 Quick-cooking oats are just old-fashioned oats rolled even thinner, and instant oats are steamed longer and rolled even more thinly.4981 Then, at the bottom of the list, the most processed would be powdered oats, which you might find in oat-based breakfast cereals. Instead of buying boxed breakfast cereals, make oatmeal out of whole, intact oats. They’re gr-r-oat!

I like to start my mornings with what I call my BROL bowl. BROL stands for barley, rye, oats, and lentils. Most people are only familiar with pearled barley, which is partially refined by having some of its bran polished off. You can buy barley groats, sold as hulled or hull-less barley. If your budget allows, go for purple barley, which naturally contains some of the antioxidant pigments found in berries as a bonus. Rye groats are typically sold as rye berries. Oat groats are just oat groats, though I’ve also seen the terms hull-less and hulled oats. And since I know I should probably check off a morning legume box on my Daily Dozen, I add black lentils, which are the most antioxidant-packed,4982 sold as beluga lentils due to their resemblance to expensive caviar.

I have them all premixed in an unimaginative 1:1:1:1 ratio and then, in an electric pressure cooker, just cook one scoop of dry BROL to two scoops of water. There’s probably a quicker way to do it, but I simply press a default one-touch button for thirty minutes, and it comes out fine. Of course, that’s just the base. It has a great texture but very little flavor. Depending on my mood, I go savory with greens and mushrooms or sweet with frozen dark red cherries, cocoa powder, dates, and walnuts, giving me more of a chocolate-covered-cherry sensation. I’ll make sure to include a bunch of these recipes in my forthcoming cookbook.

With all the new data on the importance of food form, I’m starting to sour on flour, so I advise not living by bread alone. The new structure created by the pasta-making process can mediate these effects, though, so you don’t have to say basta to pasta.

Summary for How Not To Diet

V. Dr. Greger’s Twenty-One Tweaks

Too Much Food, Not Enough Calories
In How Not to Die, I compiled the healthiest of the Green Light foods into my Daily Dozen checklist of foods I encourage people to try to fit into their daily routines. I made it into a free app, Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen, available for iPhone and Android, so anyone and everyone can try to check off all the boxes every day and track their progress over time.

As the feedback poured in from people giving the app a try, two themes of complaints arose. The first was that it was just too much food. There was no way they could eat all that food in one day. In response, I explained that the Daily Dozen was aspirational, something to shoot for, just a tool to inspire people to include some of the healthiest of healthy foods into their daily diets. The vast volume of food I prescribed was on purpose. I was hoping that by telling people to eat so much healthy stuff, it would naturally crowd out some of the less-healthy stuff. After checking off all twenty-four servings in the Daily Dozen, there’s only so much room left for a pepperoni pizza.

Ironically, the second major complaint we got is that it doesn’t have enough calories. I had to explain that the Daily Dozen just represented the minimum I encourage people to eat, not the maximum, and that, certainly, training athletes requiring thousands more calories would have to eat much more. This all got me thinking, though. Too much food but too few calories? Sounds like the perfect weight-loss diet!

The Daily Dozen is by definition all Green Light foods, all whole plant foods, so that right there bakes in all seventeen of the ideal weight-loss diet ingredients listed here. What about the calorie count? A systematic review of successful weight-loss strategies concluded that given the metabolic slowing and increased appetite that accompanies weight loss, to achieve significant weight loss, calorie counts may need to drop as low as 1,200 calories a day for women and 1,500 calories a day for men.4983 I set up a spreadsheet and tried a bunch of common foods in each of the categories, and what do you know: The Daily Dozen averages about 1,200 calories, with the higher-calorie food choices nailing 1,500 calories.

The Daily Dozen Diet
There are a number of tweaks necessary to optimize the Daily Dozen for weight loss. A typical breakfast of Green Light foods that would check off a few of the Daily Dozen boxes would be a big bowl of oatmeal sweetened with raisins. Based on what we learned in the Low in Calorie Density, High in Water-Rich Foods, Eating Rate, and Wall Off Your Calories sections, we could optimize that meal for weight loss by making the oatmeal from steel-cut or whole groats rather than rolled or instant, cooking it thick, and switching the dried fruit for fresh, for example, swapping in strawberries for the raisins. If we did want to use dried, as we learned in the Amping AMPK and Inflammation Quenchers sections, barberries or gojis might be a better choice.

Similarly, when choosing vegetables, we can steer toward above-ground veggies highest on the water scale. Bell peppers have that nicotine edge I described in Amping AMPK, and uncooked vegetables in general offer more orosensory stimulation. If you want to go underground, based on what we learned about glycemic load, sweet potatoes would be preferable to white. We certainly want to mix it up, though, to take advantage of our built-in striving for variety, and since vegetables represent the healthiest class of foods with the fewest calories, we should aim to eat them earlier in the meal.

In the Appetite Suppression section, we learned yet another reason to include ground flaxseeds in our daily diets. Nuts are a great complement to greens to boost the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients, but they ideally should be eaten raw and whole or coarsely chopped rather than blended into butters. Miss the taste of peanut butter? A sprinkle of any one of the myriad powdered peanut butters on the market can help satisfy that craving. This is not to say something like almond butter or tahini is unhealthy by any stretch, but for weight-loss acceleration, structurally intact nuts and seeds would be better.

My free Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen app has become so popular that I decided to completely revamp it with new features for this book, so I’ve incorporated all these tweaks to the Daily Dozen to optimize it for weight control. You just have to switch over to the weight-loss setting. Now, you can not only track your progress, graphing your momentum day to day and month to month to see how well you’re nailing each of the Daily Dozen, but since so many seemed to really appreciate having a list of reminders to check off throughout the day, I decided to add an entirely new checklist to capture the weight-loss boosters I documented in part IV. With this new, expanded version of the app, you can toggle over to weight-loss mode and make a game out of how many of the new fat-busting boosters you can squeeze in every day, along with your Daily Dozen checkboxes.

Boxes of Tricks
Some of the weight-loss boosters are automatically taken care of with the Daily Dozen. For example, fat-blocking thylakoids and calcium are covered with my recommendation to eat lots of low-oxalate greens. But for the others, I’ve developed my Twenty-One Tweaks, practical takeaways from the boosters collected into one simple list on the next page.

You may have noticed that not all the strategies I covered in part IV are included in the list. Some only apply to certain individuals. For example, asking people to get into the NEAT habit of using steppers, fidget bars, or bouncing their knees during prolonged sitting may only apply to those with desk jobs. Other accelerants may be too risky for general consumption. For example, while the 25:5 modified fasting shows promise, you probably shouldn’t drop below a thousand calories a day for more than twenty-four hours without medical supervision.4984 Finally, there are options that show theoretical promise but haven’t been sufficiently vetted in clinical trials, such as pistachios for circadian synchronization or mixing peppermint oil into hand lotion to facilitate BAT activation.

So here’s the list of strategies that made the cut—broadly applicable, relatively safe, and evidence-based. See how many of these easily actionable tweaks you can incorporate into your daily routine.

￼
At Each Meal
Preload with Water
Time your metabolism-boosting two cups of cool or cold unflavored water before each meal to also take advantage of its preload benefits.

Preload with “Negative Calorie” Foods
As the first course, start each meal with an apple or a Green Light soup or salad containing fewer than one hundred calories per cup.

Incorporate Vinegar (2 tsp with each meal)
Never drink vinegar straight. Instead, flavor meals or dress a side salad with any of the sweet and savory vinegars out there. If you want to drink it, make sure to mix it in a glass of water and, afterward, be sure to rinse your mouth out with water to protect your tooth enamel.

Enjoy Undistracted Meals
Don’t eat while watching TV or playing on your phone. Give yourself a check for each meal you’re able to eat without distraction.

Follow the Twenty-Minute Rule
Whether through increasing viscosity or the number of chews, or decreasing bite size and eating rate, dozens of studies have demonstrated that no matter how we boost the amount of time food is in our mouths, it can result in lower caloric intake. So extend meal duration to at least twenty minutes to allow your natural satiety signals to take full effect. How? By choosing foods that take longer to eat and eating them in a way that prolongs the time they stay in your mouth. Think bulkier, harder, chewier foods in smaller, well-chewed bites.

Every Day
Take Your Daily Doses
Black Cumin (Nigella sativa) (¼ tsp)
As noted in the Appetite Suppression section, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled weight-loss trials found that about a quarter teaspoon of black cumin powder every day appears to reduce body mass index within a span of a couple of months. Note that black cumin is different from regular cumin, for which the dosing is different. (See below.)

Garlic Powder (¼ tsp)
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have found that as little as a daily quarter teaspoon of garlic powder can reduce body fat at a cost of perhaps two cents a day.

Ground Ginger (1 tsp) or Cayenne Pepper (½ tsp)
Randomized controlled trials have found that ¼ teaspoon to 1½ teaspoons a day of ground ginger significantly decreased body weight for just pennies a day. It can be as easy as stirring the ground spice into a cup of hot water. Note: Ginger may work better in the morning than evening. Chai tea is a tasty way to combine the green tea and ginger tweaks into a single beverage.

Alternately, for BAT activation, you can add one raw jalapeño pepper or a half teaspoon of red pepper powder (or, presumably, crushed red pepper flakes) into your daily diet. To help beat the heat, you can very thinly slice or finely chop the jalapeño to reduce its bite to little prickles, or mix the red pepper into soup or the whole-food vegetable smoothie I featured in one of my cooking videos on NutritionFacts.org.4985

Nutritional Yeast (2 tsp)
Two teaspoons of baker’s, brewer’s, or nutritional yeast contains roughly the amount of beta 1,3/1,6 glucans found in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials to facilitate weight loss.

Cumin (Cuminum cyminum) (½ tsp with lunch and dinner)
Overweight women randomized to add a half teaspoon of cumin to their lunches and dinners beat out the control group by four more pounds and an extra inch off their waists. There is also evidence to support the use of the spice saffron, but a pinch a day would cost a dollar, whereas a teaspoon of cumin costs less than ten cents.

Green Tea (3 cups)
Drink three cups a day between meals (waiting at least an hour after a meal so as to not interfere with iron absorption). During meals, drink water, black coffee, or hibiscus tea mixed 6:1 with lemon verbena, but never exceed three cups of fluid an hour (important given my water preloading advice).

Take advantage of the reinforcing effect of caffeine by drinking your green tea along with something healthy you wish you liked more, but don’t consume large amounts of caffeine within six hours of bedtime. Taking your tea without sweetener is best, but if you typically sweeten your tea with honey or sugar, try yacon syrup instead.

Stay Hydrated
Check this box if your urine never appeared darker than a pale yellow all day. Note that if you’re eating riboflavin-fortified foods (such as nutritional yeast), then base this instead on getting nine cups of unsweetened beverages a day for women (which would be taken care of by the green tea and water preloading recommendations) or thirteen cups a day for men. If you have heart or kidney issues, don’t increase fluid intake at all without first talking with your physician. Remember, diet soda may be calorie-free, but it’s not consequence-free, as we learned in the Low in Added Sugar section.

Deflour Your Diet
Check this box every day your whole grain servings are in the form of intact grains. The powdering of even 100 percent whole grains robs our microbiomes of the starch that would otherwise be ferried down to our colons encapsulated in unbroken cell walls.

Front-Load Your Calories
There are metabolic benefits to distributing more calories to earlier in the day, so make breakfast (ideally) or lunch your largest meal of the day in true king/prince/pauper style.

Time-Restrict Your Eating
Confine eating to a daily window of time of your choosing under twelve hours in length that you can stick to consistently, seven days a week. Given the circadian benefits of reducing evening food intake, the window should end before 7:00 p.m.

Optimize Exercise Timing
The Daily Dozen’s recommendation for optimum exercise duration for longevity is ninety minutes of moderately intense activity a day, which is also the optimum exercise duration for weight loss. Anytime is good, and the more the better, but there may be an advantage to exercising in a fasted state, at least six hours after your last meal. Typically, this would mean before breakfast, but if you timed it right, you could exercise midday before a late lunch or, if lunch is eaten early enough, before dinner. This is the timing for nondiabetics.

Diabetics and prediabetics should instead start exercising thirty minutes after the start of a meal and ideally go for at least an hour to completely straddle the blood sugar peak. If you had to choose a single meal to exercise after, it would be dinner, due to the circadian rhythm of blood sugar control that wanes throughout the day. Ideally, though, breakfast would be the largest meal of the day, and you’d exercise after that—or, even better, after every meal.

Weigh Yourself Twice a Day
Regular self-weighing is considered crucial for long-term weight control, but there is insufficient evidence to support a specific frequency of weighing. My recommendation is based on the one study that found that twice daily—upon waking and right before bed—appeared superior to once a day (about six versus two pounds of weight loss over twelve weeks).

Complete Your Implementation Intentions
Every two months, create three new implementation intentions—“if X, then Y” plans to perform a particular behavior in a specific context—and check each one off as you complete them every day.

Every Night
Fast After 7:00 p.m.
Because of our circadian rhythms, food eaten at night is more fattening than the exact same food eaten earlier in the day, so fast every night for at least twelve hours starting before 7:00 p.m. The fewer calories after sundown, the better.

Get Sufficient Sleep
Check this box if you got at least seven hours of sleep at your regular bedtime.

Experiment with Mild Trendelenburg
Try spending at least four hours a night lying with your body tilted head-down six degrees by elevating the posts at the foot of your bed by eight inches (or by nine inches if you have a California king). Be extremely careful when you get out of bed, as this causes orthostatic intolerance in most people, even if you’re young and healthy—meaning if you get up too fast, you can feel dizzy, faint, or light-headed and could fall and hurt yourself. So get up slowly. Drinking two cups of cold water thirty minutes before rising may also help prevent this potentially hazardous side effect.

IMPORTANT: Do not try this at home at all if you have any heart or lung issues, acid reflux, or problems with your brain (like head trauma) or eyes (even a family history of glaucoma disqualifies you). Also do not try this until you ask your physician if they think it’s safe for you to sleep in mild Trendelenburg.

Tick All the Right Boxes
Between the twenty-four checkboxes in the Daily Dozen and the thirty-seven new checkboxes in the Tweaks, you may feel a bit overwhelmed, but it’s easy to knock off a bunch at a time. For example, starting a meal with a tomato salad sprinkled with some black cumin, garlic powder, and balsamic vinegar hits five boxes right there, including the “Preload with ‘Negative Calorie’ Foods” tweak and the Daily Dozen box for “Other Vegetables.” And if that was one of your implementation intentions, make that six! Ten percent of your boxes nailed with a single appetizer.

Of course, you don’t have to hit all the booster boxes every day. You don’t even have to hit any. A healthy diet, as encapsulated by the Daily Dozen, should be all you need to lose as much weight as you want, but the more of these extra tweaks you can hit, the more successful you may be. I’m working on an entire How Not to Diet Cookbook to try to fit as many of these combinations together into delicious recipes and hearty meal plans—but in the meanwhile, please feel free to download the free, updated Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen app on your Android or iPhone. Start experimenting with a few of the Twenty-One Tweaks and see which ones work for you. My goal is to provide you with the broadest palette of tools to choose from.

Remember, it’s not what you eat today that matters, or tomorrow, or next week, but rather what you eat over the next months, years, and decades, so you have to find lifestyle changes that fit into your lifestyle.
