Despite the treatment’s beneficial effects, it’s still advisable to get a physical exam before you start putting the protocol into practice. In my own clinical research at the University of Kansas, I don’t let anyone begin the full program until they’ve first seen a doctor. This policy may surprise you, but it’s based on sound reasoning. For one thing, it’s always a good idea to check with a physician before embarking on a new exercise program. The same goes for taking high-dose nutritional supplements or increasing sun exposure. Since these are all core elements of the TLC program, it’s important to get your doctor’s okay before you begin.

// What is required to be healthy is simple, actually doing it is harder. Especially when merchants tempt the population and then they say the people have the freedom to choose. So there is easy access to unhealthy but tasty food, but the healthy stuff you have to cook it and sometimes is more expensive. Even if the healthy food was to be as easily accessible as unhealthy food, people will still opt for the unhealthy food because it's tastier. So if you are a child and get to choose you will always choose tasty vs healthy and if you grow that way thats how you most likely will continue with your life.

Try to make access to unhealthy food harder.

// All over the world food is part of human culture, it's an uphill battle to resist unhealthy food when it's part of your culture. You see it on TV, Internet, magazines, newspapers etc. The group you belong, in general will not like it when you are different, you will be asked questions one that is often used in different variations  "Where do you get your protein ?"  "How can you live without meat ? Is it safe to not eat meat, eggs and dairy ? Aren't you gonna get sick or starve ?".

The people in the group do not like it when a member is too different. The instinct is to judge and exclude that person. That's why you will hear observations, or questions that actually mean "Why aren't you like us!" "Because you are not like us, we don't feel comfortable. If we don't feel comfortable, we will exclude you." . This is ancient behaviour, inherited from animals. Rate of survival is better in a group, but if you are in a group you can't be too different or the group will suffer, so you will be excluded.

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. It is related to the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability.

A group of Canadian medical researchers recently tried to find out just how much more. They recruited volunteers from their own hospital, and measured everyone’s blood levels of vitamin D during the dead of winter. Most people, of course, were deficient. So the human guinea pigs were randomly assigned to start taking either 1000 IU or 4000 IU of vitamin D3 each day. Surprisingly, even after a few months, many people taking 1000 IU a day—two and a half times the recommended amount—still didn’t get their blood levels up high enough. It took 4000 IU a day—for a period of up to three months—to bring everyone up into the ideal range.

Doctors can get skittish, though, when you starting talking 
about such a large daily dose of vitamin D. The biggest worry is that it might throw off your calcium balance, since vitamin D helps regulate the body’s ability to use this key mineral. However, no one in the Canadian study had any calcium-related problems (or any other adverse health effects) at the 4000 IU dose. Even more reassuring, a study last year looked at a group of multiple sclerosis patients taking 40,000 IU of vitamin D3 every day (one hundred times the recommended daily allowance), and none of them had any adverse medical effects, either.

Still, the official medical tolerable upper intake level for vitamin D, published by the Institute of Medicine in 1997, is listed at only 2000 IU per day. Anything above this level is considered potentially unsafe. Although numerous researchers in the area say this recommendation is outdated—that the tolerable limit should be raised—doctors are understandably reluctant to practice outside the field’s official guidelines.
 
So what should you do if you want to go the supplement route to make sure you have enough vitamin D? I’m afraid there’s no perfect solution, but you at least have some decent options.
 
The simplest approach is to start by taking 2000 IU of vitamin D3 in supplement form each day. (You can pick up a couple months’ supply at a local health food store for a few dollars.) This dose is high enough to push most people up into the ideal range for vitamin D blood levels. However, because the dose is 
also right at the tolerable upper intake level, it’s important to check with your doctor before starting on such a high-dose regimen. In addition, after a few months of supplementing at this dose, it would be a good idea to have your doctor do a blood test to make sure you’re actually getting enough. According to the best published evidence, your blood level of vitamin D36 should be at least as high as 30 ng/mL (or 75 nmol/L) for optimal health.
 
A more aggressive approach—but one you should definitely consider if you’re currently depressed, or if you have a history of seasonal affective disorder—is to see your doctor right away to have your blood level of vitamin D evaluated. If it’s very low (below 15 ng/mL or 37 nmol/L), you can talk with your doctor about taking a high dose of vitamin D3—up to 10,000 IU per day—for several weeks under his or her supervision, with regular monitoring to make sure there are no side effects, and to ensure that your blood levels make it quickly into a healthier range.

// lack of vitamin B12 in plants
Vitamin B12 is more problematic. Vitamin B12 is made by microorganisms
found in the soil and by microorganisms in the intestines of
animals, including our own. The amount made in our intestines is not
adequately absorbed, so it is recommended that we consume B12 in food.
Research has convincingly shown that plants grown in healthy soil that
has a good concentration of vitamin B12 will readily absorb this nutrient.
However, plants grown in "lifeless" soil (non-organic soil) may
be deficient in vitamin B12. In the United States, most of our agriculture
takes place on relatively lifeless soil, decimated from years of unnatural
pesticide, herbicide and fertilizer use. So the plants grown in this soil
and sold in our supermarkets lack B12

Daily supplements of vitamin B12, and perhaps vitamin D for people
who spend most of their time indoors and or live in the northern climates
are encouraged. For vitamin D, you shouldn't exceed RDA recommendations.
That's it. That's the diet science has found to be consistent with the

Psychotherapy in the Real World

 
During their medical school training, aspiring doctors are taught to base every treatment decision on an up-to-date knowledge of the relevant research literature, and they generally carry this scientific sensibility with them throughout their careers. So when physicians encounter, say, a patient with a clogged coronary artery, they should automatically begin generating a set of scientifically informed questions: What are the available treatment options? Which option—bypass surgery, angioplasty, medication, and so on—is likely to prove the most effective for this patient, given the location and extent of the blockage? What does the research say?
 
We take it as a given that a doctor’s decisions will be guided by the best available scientific evidence, and most of us would be appalled to find a physician who simply ignored or neglected the latest research findings in the field. Surely the same holds true for psychotherapists, doesn’t it? After all, just like medical doctors, therapists deal with an array of life-threatening conditions—disorders such as anorexia nervosa and substance abuse and depression. Aren’t psychotherapists, like physicians, trained to base their treatment decisions on the best and most relevant research evidence? Sadly, the majority are not.
 
The problem traces back to the enduring influence of Sigmund Freud, who launched the institution of psychotherapy over a century ago. Despite his superb scientific training as a research neurologist, Freud never felt the need to conduct careful scientific studies on the effectiveness of the psychotherapy techniques he developed. Indeed, Freud was so convinced that his treatment method just had to be effective, he asked the world to rely on the “evidence” of mere anecdotes and a smattering of published case studies—some of which were later shown by historians to have been fabricated. Likewise, his followers were encouraged to accept the effectiveness of Freudian therapy as an article of faith, rather than subjecting the therapy to rigorous scientific scrutiny. And for over a century Freud’s legacy has persisted: Many practicing psychotherapists still fail to base their clinical practice on sound scientific research.

After decades of tinkering and creative innovation, there are now over four hundred distinct varieties of psychotherapy being practiced by clinicians (with dozens of allegedly new techniques appearing each year), and the vast majority of these treatments have never been tested scientifically. Even when it comes to the treatment of depressive illness, many practicing therapists are still using techniques for which there is absolutely no supportive scientific evidence. This is not to say that all of these untested techniques are ineffective. They might work. But then again they might not. The point is that we simply have no way of knowing, and in the absence of solid research evidence we will never know for sure. Freudian therapy was practiced for nearly eighty years before a definitive set of studies showed that it’s often ineffective in treating depression.
 
How many other psychotherapy techniques in widespread use today will prove similarly unhelpful once they’re finally subjected to the clear light of scientific scrutiny? Although we have no way of knowing for certain, I believe it is now difficult for any therapist to justify using unproven techniques for treating depression when we have good research evidence that approaches like cognitive therapy and behavioral activation—when skillfully implemented—are reasonably effective, with a long-term efficacy at least equivalent to that of antidepressant medication.

Abstract
Obesity has traditionally been thought of as a state of caloric imbalance, where the intake of calories exceeds the expenditure or ‘burning’ of calories. However, a more nuanced appreciation for the complex biochemistry and physiology of cellular energy generation suggests that obesity is a state of hormonal imbalance causing increased shunting of food energy into adipose tissue for storage, resulting in decreased satiety and ultimately leading to increased caloric intake. Adding to this hypothesis, we propose that obesity is also a state of nutrient and energy deficit, leading to decreased fatty acid mobilisation and oxidation, the result of which may be a natural disinclination towards physical activity. Added sugars (sucrose, a.k.a. table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup) may provide energy (4 kcal/g) but at current intakes they do not facilitate—and may even hinder—the production of energy. Not only do added sugars displace nutritionally superior foods in the diet, but they may also deplete nutrients from other foods that have been consumed, as well as from body stores, in order to enable their proper oxidation and liberate their calories as energy. Additionally, the consumption of added sugars damages the mitochondria and hence impairs energy generation. Moreover, overconsuming added sugars may result in a kind of ‘internal starvation’ (via leptin and insulin resistance) leading to further hunger signals in the body. Added sugars promote nutrient and energy deficit and through this novel pathway promote obesity.

Introduction
Nutrient/energy deficit in obesity
Sugar was first extracted from sugar cane and sugar beets hundreds of years ago, and later ‘purified’ into a white crystalline form. In modern times, sugar has been isolated and refined to a degree that allows it to be integrated into the food supply in quantities and concentrations that do not occur naturally and are unlikely to have been encountered in human evolutionary history. Pure crystalline sugar, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and other caloric sweeteners consumed in beverages and processed foods provide a supra-physiological glycaemic load,1 overwhelming the body's processing capacity and leading to detrimental metabolic effects (eg, hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and oxidative stress).1 Because of this refinement, added sugars now behave like drug-like substances.2 3 Although edible, added sugars cannot be considered a ‘food’, nor can their consumption be equated to eating foods that contain natural amounts of sugar, but which also provide fibre, vitamins, minerals and other phytonutrients that combat oxidative stress produced by the small amounts of fructose present. As the ‘dose makes the poison’, the food industry has made it possible for consumers to easily ‘overdose’ on added sugars, making this an issue of concern for public health worldwide, wherever there is significant consumption of processed, highly refined and sugar-dense foods.

Added sugars are not food
Sugar is not among the recommended foods. Its recent rationing will not provoke a hardship, for sugar supplies nothing in nutrition but calories, and the vitamins provided by other foods are sapped by sugar to liberate these calories.4 (Emphasis added) (Wilder—Handbook of Nutrition)

The definition of food is, ‘Material that contains essential nutrients, which are assimilated by an organism to produce energy, stimulate growth and maintain life’.5 Many types of added sugars do not fit this definition. While caloric sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup, molasses and sorghum syrup (also known as ‘free sugars’) may provide trace amounts of micronutrients, the sweetening agents most commonly added to processed foods—sucrose and HFCS—do not. In fact, these added sugars not only lack essential nutrients, but they also have detrimental effects on all three important functions of food (eg, produce energy, stimulate growth and maintain life). These two added sugars (sucrose and HFCS) will be the disaccharides of focus in this review.

Added sugars do not produce energy or stimulate growth
Starting with the first necessary function of a food—‘produce energy’—added sugars in fact deplete energy from the body, either by depleting tissue nutrient stores or nutrients obtained from other ingested foods.4 Added sugars also displace nutritionally superior foods from the diet and at the same time increase nutritional requirements.4 6 Specifically, vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin and niacin are necessary for the oxidation of glucose, and phosphates are stripped from ATP in order to metabolise fructose, which leads to cellular ATP depletion.4 7 The metabolism of fructose also leads to oxidative stress, inflammation and damage to the mitochondria, causing a state of ATP depletion.8 Hence, the liberation of calories from added sugars requires nutrients and increases nutritional demands, but these sugars provide no additional nutrients. Thus, the more added sugars one consumes, the more nutritionally depleted one may become. This may be particularly extreme in individuals whose habitual diet is already insufficient in key micronutrients.

//* 
The conversion of food calories into energy in the form of ATP does not occur by chance, with no requirements for input into the biochemical pathways involved. Via glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, carbohydrates—including refined sugars—are converted into energy. The reactions these processes comprise are dependent on required cofactors in the form of vitamins and minerals; however, isolated and refined sugars have been stripped of their micronutrient content, which may impair their conversion into energy and/or result in a net nutrient deficit if such nutrients must be siphoned from body stores in order to keep these processes running efficiently. Contrast this with foods consumed in their whole, unrefined forms, which typically contain at least some of the nutrients required to liberate their energy.

The popularity of low-carbohydrate diets for fat loss, as well as their efficacy for improving a broad range of health conditions,9–12 has led to an unfortunate across-the-board demonisation of carbohydrates among some nutrition and healthcare professionals. While individuals who are insulin resistant or have type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes or the metabolic syndrome (which, according to the American Diabetes Association, is well over 100 million people in the USA alone, including as many as 26% of individuals aged 65 or older13) may manage their blood glucose and insulin levels best on reduced carbohydrate diets,10 11 14 it is not carbohydrate-dense foods, per se, that contribute to impaired energy production. Rather, it is carbohydrate foods that have been stripped of their natural complement of nutrients and fibre and extracted from their whole-food matrices that may be placing the largest metabolic burden on the body, particularly when they contain additional carbohydrates in the form of added sugars, such as may be found in soft drinks and cookies, crackers, bread, breakfast cereal, granola bars, etc, made from refined grains with additional sugars and sweeteners added as preservatives and for enhanced palatability.

Glycolysis—the conversion of glucose to pyruvate with a net yield of 2 ATP—requires magnesium as an enzyme cofactor in at least six individual reactions. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A and is the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, requires thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid for proper enzymatic function. B-vitamins are required again for effective functioning of the citric acid cycle, which will produce an additional 36 ATP, and is the process by which the majority of energy is generated in all cells except those lacking mitochondria. Unlike isolated refined sugars, carbohydrate-rich whole foods—such as sweet potatoes, white potatoes, beets, parsnips and winter squashes, as well as whole grains, such as hard red winter wheat and millet—provide critical minerals and B-vitamins required for the proper use of these foods in the body. Added sugars provide fuel in the form of carbohydrate but lack the accessory nutrients needed to convert that fuel into energy. We are not suggesting that each food consumed must, in isolation, contain the full complement of nutrients required for its metabolism and oxidation; a varied omnivorous diet would be expected to meet these basic nutritional needs. However, consumption of large amounts of added sugars may displace nutritionally superior foods in the diet, ultimately resulting in a net deficit of vitamin and mineral enzyme cofactors required for not only the oxidation of the glucose, itself, but for that of whole foods.

Additionally, fructose consumed at current levels found in much of the industrialised world has been found to deplete cellular ATP levels in vascular endothelial cells,15 with as little as 50 g of fructose (found in approximately one 24 oz soft drink) being able to deplete hepatic ATP levels in humans.16 17 This results in appetite stimulation and increased hunger signals, prompting increased caloric intake, which may ultimately lead to weight gain and obesity.8 As the average American consumes 83.1 g of fructose per day,18 with up to 20% of the population exceeding 100 g/day,15 current levels of fructose consumption may lead to chronic energy depletion causing increased hunger and lack of energy to exercise. Thus, increased caloric intake and reduced physical activity are logical consequences of overconsuming added sugars. However, while the end result may be obesity in susceptible individuals who are simply following the biological cues prompted by these hijacked metabolic processes, increased caloric intake and a reduction in physical activity (ie, eating more and moving less) are merely the proximal causes of body fat gain; consumption of large amounts of refined sugars is the ultimate underlying cause, triggering the cascade as a whole.19 As many soft drinks are produced with HFCS that contain up to 65% fructose, this is particularly concerning.20–22 The overconsumption of added sugars does not produce energy despite providing energy, which is somewhat of a paradox. In order for a substance to be classified as ‘food’, it must produce or at least facilitate the production of energy, not just provide energy.

The consumption of sugar and of other relatively pure carbohydrates has become so great during recent years that it presents a serious obstacle to the improved nutrition of the general public.4 (The Council on Foods and Nutrition, 1942)

Written over 70 years ago, this observation may be even more relevant today. Indeed, many of the concerns about the detrimental effects of sugar stem from its current excessive consumption worldwide. Recent estimates indicate that the average annual per capita consumption of sugar ranges from 77 to 152 pounds,23 24 which is ∼20-fold to 40-fold greater than estimates of consumption just a few hundred years ago.25 This level of consumption equates to around 400–800 calories per person per day from added sugars. On a diet of 2000 calories per day, 800 calories from added sugars represents a dilution of 40%, or a 40% displacement of foods with higher nutrient density by foods that not only provide fewer nutrients, but which may, in fact, require increased nutrient intake simply to be metabolised. It is easy to understand how consuming added sugars leads to nutritional deficit.4 6

Soft drink consumption is associated with lower intakes of calcium and other nutrients,26 which may lead to malnutrition, especially in children.2 Additionally, the overconsumption of added sugars is linked to the development of insulin resistance in humans and animals,27–30 which decreases the body's ability to use glucose as energy. Moreover, the ensuing rise in insulin levels decreases the body's ability to use its other key fuel source, fats. (Via inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase, chronically elevated insulin keeps fatty acids sequestered in adipose tissue, reducing their availability for β-oxidation and the generation of ATP.31 32) In essence, cells are starved for energy because energy generation from fatty acids is inhibited when insulin levels are high, resulting in what has been referred to as ‘internal starvation’ or ‘hidden cellular semistarvation’.33 More colloquially, it can be thought of as ‘starvation in the land of plenty’. Not only that, but elevated insulin levels increase energy requirements,31 further leading to a net energy loss with the consumption of added sugars. Owing to the lack of access to fuel substrates, individuals with obesity and hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance may fit the description of ‘overfed but undernourished’. While they are carrying thousands of calories of stored fuel in the form of adipose tissue, the hormonal pattern that they are locked into due to the overconsumption of refined sugars suggests that, at the cellular level, they are starving.

Sugar also has the ability to derail an appetite for nutrient-dense foods, causing further nutrient depletion.2 This is likely caused by the elevation in insulin levels prompted by refined carbohydrates, which may lead to cravings for yet more carbohydrate due to insulin's effect on fuel partitioning and its inhibition of energy generation from fatty acids.31 Animal studies also show that feeding sugar to rats hinders growth and shortens lifespan.18 34 Several other experiments in a variety of animal species show that the addition of sugar to otherwise adequate diets causes these animals to malnourish themselves to death.35 And numerous studies in animals indicate that replacing starch with sugar shortens their lifespan, so again, it is not carbohydrate, per se, that has a detrimental effect, but rather, refined and nutritionally void sugars.36–38 The aforementioned data do not support the definition of food.

Finally, fructose and glucose favour the growth of bacteria and yeast,2 39–41 particularly in those who already have elevated levels of yeast.42 Glucose has been found to increase the proliferation and virulence of Candida albicans.40 43 As C. albicans competes with host cells for nutrients44 and requires a high influx of glucose (yielding just two molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose metabolised via fermentation),45 this may be of particular concern with added sugars feeding increasing populations of intestinal yeast that then siphon nutrients and energy from the rest of the body. Sugar has also been shown to irritate the linings of the stomach and intestine,2 25 which may compromise digestive function and the absorption of nutrients. Finally, the hyperosmolar effect of fructose can induce diarrhoea,46 which may lead to a further loss of nutrients.2 Box 1 provides an overview of the mechanisms relating the consumption of added sugars with overall nutrient and energy depletion, making added sugars unfit to be considered food.

Box 1
How added sugars promote obesity through energy/nutrient depletion
Displaces nutritionally superior foods.2

Decreases appetite for more nutritious food.2

Depletes nutrients within the body (in order to liberate the calories from sugar, as well as from an increase in bacterial and yeast overgrowth).2

Provides zero nutrition.2

The consumption of added sugars has been shown to cause insulin resistance.27–30 This will result in decreased use of glucose for energy (decreased uptake into cells),47 as well as impaired oxidation of fatty acids for energy.31 32 Energy requirements are also increased due to elevated insulin levels.33 Thus, because the consumption of added sugars can lead to insulin resistance, they can induce a state of ‘internal starvation’, also referred to as ‘hidden cellular semistarvation’.33

Decreases nutrient absorption due to intestinal irritation/damage.2 25

Increases nutrient excretion caused by fructose malabsorption leading to diarrhoea.46

Damages the mitochondria and depletes ATP.8

Produces unnatural drug-like cravings leading to a vicious cycle of continued consumption and further nutrient depletion.

Added sugars do not maintain life
Mankind has survived without isolated, refined sugar for almost 2.6 million years.48 The body—in particular, the brain—has been thought to require upwards of 200 g of glucose per day, leading to the often cited dogma that glucose is ‘essential for life’.1 While it is true that glucose is essential for sustaining life, there is no requirement for dietary glucose, as fatty acids can be turned into brain-fuelling ketone bodies, and amino acids and glycerol are gluconeogenic substrates.49 Indeed, in the relative absence of dietary glucose, ketone bodies may supply upwards of 75% of the brain's required energy, with the remainder supplied by gluconeogenesis provided by amino acids (from dietary protein or catabolism of body proteins) and from glycerol (provided by the breakdown of triglycerides in adipose tissue).33 Thus, exogenous glucose (eg, from added sugars) is not essential for sustaining life in humans, and in most people, restricting dietary carbohydrates seems to produce no ill effects.49 In fact, according to the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academies of Sciences, ‘The lower limit of dietary carbohydrate compatible with life apparently is zero, provided that adequate amounts of protein and fat are consumed’.50

Administration of fructose or sucrose in humans has been shown to cause each of the abnormalities that define the metabolic syndrome (eg, elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, elevated blood glucose, elevated blood pressure and weight gain (specifically around the abdomen)),30 51–55 as well as features found in patients with coronary heart disease (eg, increased platelet adhesiveness and hyperinsulinaemia),56 57 all of which can be reversed entirely upon reverting to a diet low in sugar.47 52 56 58–60 Consumption of added sugars at current levels of intake is proposed as a contributing factor in a multitude of other diseases associated with early mortality, such as cardiometabolic disease,61–64 obesity,30 61 65–68 β-cell dysfunction and type 2 diabetes,6 20 69–71 hypertension,51 64 72 non-alcoholic fatty liver7 and atherosclerosis.6 73 74 Because of this, added sugars cannot be considered food.

Moving forward
As ∼75% of all packaged foods and beverages in the USA contain added sugars,75 efforts should focus on their reduction in order to combat numerous chronic disease states and improve the general nutritional status of the population as a whole. We are not here advocating for the total elimination of added sugars from the food supply. Such an approach is not only unnecessary, but is also economically unrealistic and culturally insensitive, as there are special events and celebrations that may call for traditional foods that contain large amounts of added sugars. Rather than complete removal of added sugars from one's diet, these metabolically taxing elements should be limited to occasional consumption and not be considered daily dietary staples.

There are myriad ways to accomplish a population-wide reduction in added sugars, including but not limited to: widespread public education campaigns; revision of food labels to call attention to added sugar; increased nutrition education in medical schools and for other primary healthcare providers; the taxing of edible goods high in added sugar;76–80 prohibition of government subsidies for foods high in added sugars;81 restricting the sale of beverages and edible goods high in added sugars (such as sports drinks, energy drinks and sodas) in schools and hospitals; and adding warning labels to sugar-sweetened beverages and other high-sugar products, similar to those applied to alcohol and tobacco.81 Such changes could contribute substantially to reducing population-wide intake of added sugars to a reasonable 5–10% of total caloric intake, which would likely lead to substantial improvement in public health.82

Conclusion
We propose that obesity is a state of nutrient and energy deficit brought about, in part, by the overconsumption of added sugars (specifically high-fructose corn syrup and sucrose). Added sugars provide energy (calories), but in the context of consumption at current intake levels, they hinder the production of energy, and through the direct influence on a wide array of cardiometabolic disease processes, they lead to reduced quality of life and decreased lifespan, and thus cannot be considered food. As added sugars devoid of displace more nutrient-dense foods in the diet, dilute nutrients from the body's stores and promote a host of disease states that impair nutrient absorption and energy homeostasis, efforts should be made to reduce their ubiquity and current levels of consumption.

When you eat beans you get resistant starch, by the time some of the resistant starch gets broken down(and gets transformed in short chain fatty acids) it's too far in the intestine to be absorbed and it ends in the toilet bowl, less fat for you. This resistant starch feeds a type of bacteria that slows the absorption of glucose, so if you eat white rice your glycemic index is not as high. The bacteria stays for a while depending on how much and how often you have beans in your diet also it has anti cancer properties.

When you eat food without nutrition like processed food(pleasure trap food) your body will make you crave for more food to get the nutrition it needs but if you eat crappy food it won't matter.

// Folic acid bad, Folate good
Foods with folic acid not so good

Folatul si acidul folic sunt diferite forme de vitamina B9. Desi exista o diferenta distincta intre cele doua, numele lor sunt adesea substituite si folosite in mod gresit. De fapt, chiar si in randul profesionistilor exista o multime de confuzii in ceea ce priveste acidul folic si folatul.

Acest articol explica diferenta dintre acid folic si folat si va prezinta solutiile pe care le aveti indemana pentru a beneficia pe deplin de beneficiile vitaminei B9 in timpul sarcinii si nu numai.

Vitamina B9
Vitamina B9 este un nutrient esential, care joaca un rol crucial in dezvoltarea celulelor si in formarea ADN-ului. Nivelurile scazute de vitamina B9 sunt asociate cu:

Homocisteina crescuta. Nivelurile ridicate de homocisteina au fost asociate cu un risc crescut de boli de inima si accident vascular cerebral.
Defecte de nastere. Nivelurile scazute de folat la femeile gravide au fost legate de anomalii la nastere, cum ar fi defectele tubului neural.
Riscul de cancer. Nivelurile slabe de folat sunt, de asemenea, legate de riscul crescut de cancer.
Din aceste motive, suplimentarea cu vitamina B9 este o practica uzuala. Fortificarea alimentelor cu acest nutrient este obligatorie in multe tari, inclusiv in Statele Unite si Canada.

Ce este folatul?
Folatul este forma naturala a vitaminei B9. Numele de folat este derivat din cuvantul latin "folium", care inseamna frunza. De fapt, legumele cu frunze sunt printre cele mai bune surse alimentare de folat.

Forma activa a vitaminei B9 este un folat cunoscut sub numele de 5-metiltetrahidrofolat (5-MTHF). In sistemul digestiv, majoritatea folatului alimentar este transformat in 5-MTHF inainte de a intra in fluxul sanguin.

Ce este acidul folic?
Acidul folic este o forma sintetica a vitaminei B9, cunoscuta si sub denumirea de acid pteroilmonoglutamic. Este folosit in suplimente si adaugat la produsele alimentare procesate, cum ar fi faina si cerealele pentru micul dejun.

Spre deosebire de folat, nu tot acidul folic pe care il consumi este transformat in forma activa a vitaminei B9 (5-MTHF) in sistemul tau digestiv. In schimb, trebuie sa fie convertit in ficat sau in alte tesuturi. Astfel, acidul folic obisnuit trebuie sa treaca prin mai multe transformari biochimice pentru a ajunge in forma biologic activa, pe care organismul o poate utiliza. Pana la 50% dintre femei nu pot metaboliza acidul folic astfel incat acestea nu beneficiaza pe deplin de efectele sale favorabile.

Ce este MTHFR?
Metabolizarea acidului folic sintetic este un proces este lent si ineficient la unii oameni. Dupa ce ai luat un supliment de acid folic, este nevoie de timp pentru ca organismul sa il transforme in 5-MTHF. Acesta este un proces in patru etape care necesita mai multe enzime, inclusiv una numita MTHFR, care gestioneaza defalcarea acidului folic sintetic. Aceasta defalcare duce la niveluri crescute de homocisteina. Homocisteina este un produs chimic produs dintr-un aminoacid din corpul nostru cand acidul folic se descompune. Daca acidul folic nu este descompus, acesta va bloca capacitatea organismului de a avea suficienti folati.

Unii oameni au mutatii genetice care fac ca enzimele MTHFR sa fie mai putin eficiente in transformarea acidului folic in 5-MTHF. Acest lucru poate duce la acumularea de acid folic in sange, care poate avea efecte negative asupra sanatatii. Chiar si o doza mica, cum ar fi 200-400 mcg pe zi, poate sa nu fie complet metabolizata pana la administrarea urmatoarei doze. Aceasta problema poate sa se agraveze atunci cand alimentele fortificate sunt consumate impreuna cu suplimente de acid folic. Drept urmare, acidul folic nemetabolizat este frecvent detectat in fluxurile de sange ale persoanelor care folosesc suplimente obisnuite de acid folic sintetic.

Acesta este un motiv de ingrijorare, deoarece nivelurile ridicate de acid folic nemetabolizat au fost asociate cu mai multe probleme de sanatate, incluzand imunitatea slaba, functionare redusa a creierului si cresterea crescuta a cancerelor preexistente, deficienta nedetectata de vitamina B12, care, lasata netratata, poate creste riscul de dementa si afecteaza functionarea sistemului nervos.

Cum este influentata sarcina de mutatiile MTHFR?
Aportul de folat activ este deosebit de important pentru formarea si dezvoltarea noilor celule, pentru sinteza ADN si ARN, embrionul uman fiind mai sensibil la deficitul de folat fata de o persoana adulta.

Femeile insarcinate care au o mutatie a genei MTHFR pot avea complicatii in timpul sarcinii. Deficitul de folat in organismul mamei poate conduce la malformatii ale fatului, cunoscute mai ales sub denumirea de defecte de tub neural (DTN). Acestea pot aparea in saptamanile 3 - 4 de sarcina si se manifesta prin neinchiderea completa a tubului neural (formatiune embrionara din care se va dezvolta sistemul nervos – la extremitatea superioara luand nastere encefalul iar din partea mijlocie si inferioara a tubului neural se formeaza maduva spinarii).

Inchiderea tubului neural are loc in mai multe etape - intr-o prima faza acesta se inchide la mijloc, urmeaza apoi partea superioara, iar la final se inchide in partea inferioara. Atunci cand fuziunea este incompleta, rezulta mai multe malformatii la nivelul creierului sau a maduvei spinarii, printre care:

Spina bifida. Acesta este un defect de nastere in care oasele coloanei vertebrale nu se dezvolta corespunzator si nu acopera integral maduva spinarii, lasand-o expusa. In functie de severitatea spinei bifide, unii copii continua sa aiba viata normala, in timp ce altii au nevoie de ingrijire cu norma intreaga.
Anencefalia. Acesta este un defect grav la nastere in care un copil se naste fara parti ale creierului sau craniului. In acest caz, speranta de viata a majoritatii bebelusilor nu este mai mare de o saptamana.
Encefalocelul. Aceasta se manifesta prin exteriorizarea tesutului nervos si a meningelului printr-un defect de os cranian.
Cea mai buna solutie terapeutica este prevenirea DTN prin administrarea zilnica de acid folic, incepand din perioada de planificare a sarcinii, intrucat aportul de folat activ trebuie asigurat inca din momentul conceptiei. Tubul neural al fatului incepe sa se dezvolte intre zilele a 21-a si a 28-a de la momentul conceptiei, ori, de multe ori, viitoarea mama nici macar nu stie ca este insarcinata.
