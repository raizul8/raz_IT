The story with the mice/rat when put in water with no escape they drawn fast
But when they are saved before they give up, when they have the belief that they will be saved, they will swim their natural time without stopping like 6-8 hours.

Record your traumas, fears, insecurities, listening to them is a way of facing them.

Record mean comments with swear words and listen to them, use them for fuel

* Use others hatred as fuel
* Record yourself, especially if you complain
* The heart rate zones 1,2,3,4,5 . For most task zone 2, steady
* Map difficult things ahead and answer the questions. When you are faced with difficult situations and end up in zones 4,5 you need to tone it down, take a knee asses the situation and answer the questions you are asking. The questions are already answered so the 1 sec situation can be resolved. The challenging thing you do in life are finite, so do them wile remembering they will be over if you endure and keep going. Remember what you will lose if you give up

Bad Mfckr enjoy the painful process, while others want to find a way out you enjoy the process.
The process is like a chisel and you are the clay.

You can be more, you can be great.

Break the mental prison, you are the warden, you have the key. Drop the demoralizing talk.

Use anger, rage to change.

- DG Use everything including negative comments from haters, record the mean comments in your voice and listen to them, use them as fuel.

Speak to yourself as if you would to a friend, positive, kind, offer action oriented advice
