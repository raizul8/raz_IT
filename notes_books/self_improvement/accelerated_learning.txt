Sleep 2 times or about 4 hours after you learned something, to consolidate information and skills, practice/learn before sleep.

Prevent stuff that gets in the way of practice, make easy to start on what you train, you may need to alter your environment (eg: don't put the guitar in a different room in a closet and in it's case, just put it somewere close at hand in a rack or if you don't have one make something similar or put it somewere that's not in the way)

1 Decide what you want, what is the target performance
2 Deconstruct the skill in subskills, practice the most important ones first
3 Research to find what subskills are important but not so much that it becomes a barrier to practice
4 Eliminate barriers to practice, make it easy to do what you need to do
5 Precomit to what you whant to practice for at least 20 hours.

-- defeat procrastination

Break down big tasks into minuscule tasks

Be on time with mini deadlines, short meetings to coordinate with others, use calendar organizer.
