Algebra,linear algebra, calculus,discrete foundational math or discrete math,statistics
For programmers, the most useful branch of discrete math is probability theory. It's the first thing they should teach you after arithmetic, in grade school.

Computer Science Reconsidered: The Invocation Model of Process Expression Karl M. Fant

Description:
The Invocation Model of Process Expression argues that mathematics does not provide the most appropriate conceptual foundations for computer science, but, rather, that these foundations are a primary source of unnecessary complexity and confusion.  It supports that there is a more appropriate conceptual model that unifies forms of expression considered quite disparate and simplifies issues considered complex and intractable.  This book presents that this model of process expression is alternative theory of computer science that is both valid and practical.
